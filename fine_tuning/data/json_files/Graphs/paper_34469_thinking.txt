To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for DC Blocker Placement" by Hongwei Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Case Studies)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **EPRI21 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a 20-bus network with 7 generators and 31 branches. It is used to evaluate the proposed model's performance.

2. **UIUC150 Dataset**: This dataset is a larger 150-bus network with 27 generators and 218 branches, also utilized for testing the model.

In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets, including their structure and the number of nodes and branches, which is crucial for understanding their application in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the PowerModelsGMD framework, which is where these datasets are available. The citation for this framework is:

- For **PowerModelsGMD**:
  > A. Mate et al. Analyzing and Mitigating the Impacts of GMD and EMP Events on the Electrical Grid with PowerModelsGMD.jl, Jan. 2021. Available at: https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsGMD.jl

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for proper documentation and future reference.
