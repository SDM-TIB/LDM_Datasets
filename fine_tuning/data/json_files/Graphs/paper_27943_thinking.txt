To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Technical Document Classification" by Shuo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the TechDoc model to a "large multimodal technical document database," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluative case study section (Section IV)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention creating a "benchmark dataset" based on the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. This indicates that the USPTO dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

In this section, they provide details about the dataset, including the number of documents (approximately 798,065) and the number of independent images (13,998,254). They also mention that the dataset includes bibliographic information such as inventors, registration dates, citations, and patent classification codes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the USPTO dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the USPTO database, I will cite the USPTO as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the USPTO dataset is:
> United States Patent and Trademark Office. *USPTO Patent Database*. Available at: https://www.uspto.gov/

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the USPTO patent dataset, which is used for training and evaluating the TechDoc model for technical document classification.
