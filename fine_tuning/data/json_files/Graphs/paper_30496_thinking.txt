To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAR: SQL Guided Pre-Training for Context-dependent Text-to-SQL Parsing" by Xiangyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a "high-quality large-scale context-dependent text-to-SQL conversation corpus," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors evaluate their method. They mention two specific datasets used for evaluation: **SPARC** and **COSQL**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text.

In the **data construction section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets:
1. **SPARC**: This dataset is described as a collection of cross-domain context-dependent datasets, consisting of about 4.3k question sequences and over 12k individual questions annotated with SQL queries.
2. **COSQL**: This dataset is a conversational text-to-SQL corpus containing approximately 3k dialogues and over 10k annotated SQL queries.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For **SPARC**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Polozov, A., Meek, C., & Awadallah, A. H. (2019). *SParC: Cross-domain semantic parsing in context*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 4511–4523, Florence, Italy.
  
- For **COSQL**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Polozov, A., Meek, C., & Awadallah, A. H. (2019). *CoSQL: A conversational text-to-SQL challenge towards cross-domain natural language interfaces to databases*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1962–1979, Hong Kong, China.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
