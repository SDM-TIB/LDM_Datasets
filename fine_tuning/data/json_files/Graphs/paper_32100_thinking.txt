To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Generalization of Multi-modal Contrastive Learning" by Qi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will proceed to the **related work** section, as it often discusses previous studies and datasets that are relevant to the current research. This section may provide insights into datasets that the authors have utilized or built upon.

I will then focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of multi-modal contrastive learning, such as those used for training models like CLIP or SimCLR. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named, such as MS-COCO or YFCC, and gather their citations.

Once I have compiled the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that each entry is clearly documented, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
