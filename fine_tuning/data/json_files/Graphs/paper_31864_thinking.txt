To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Graph Neural Networks for Large Dynamic Graphs" by Yanping Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithm on **seven real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia**: A bipartite graph of user interactions with web pages.
2. **Reddit**: A bipartite graph of user interactions with sub-reddits.
3. **UCI-MSG**: An online user interaction graph based on social networks.
4. **Bitcoin-OTC**: A user trust network based on the Bitcoin OTC platform.
5. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: A user trust network based on the Bitcoin Alpha platform.
6. **GDELT**: A temporal knowledge graph representing global events.
7. **MAG**: A large-scale dynamic paper citation network.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific features mentioned. The authors provide a brief overview of each dataset in the **datasets subsection** of Section 5.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, so I will need to look for the original sources or related papers that describe these datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Wikipedia dataset** might be:
> Srijan Kumar, Xikun Zhang, and Jure Leskovec. *Learning dynamic embeddings from temporal interactions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.02289, 2018.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets, ensuring that I capture the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Once I have all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations.
