To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain-Aware Augmentations for Unsupervised Online General Continual Learning" by Nicolas Michel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and datasets used in the experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Unsupervised Online General Continual Learning (UOGCL) and mention that they will evaluate their method on standard image classification datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look at **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, split into 5 tasks with 2 classes each, totaling 10 distinct classes.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it is split into 10 tasks with 10 classes each, resulting in 100 distinct classes.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A subset of the ILSVRC-2012 dataset, it includes 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, divided into 20 tasks with 10 classes each, leading to a total of 200 distinct classes.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is the same as for CIFAR100, as it is derived from the ILSVRC dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
