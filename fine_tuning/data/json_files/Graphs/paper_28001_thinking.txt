To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Data Augmentation Strategy with Entropy Preservation" by Xue Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, specifically in the **experiments section**.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors evaluate their model on three datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,708 machine learning papers categorized into seven classes. It is a well-known citation network used for node classification tasks.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,327 academic publications and is divided into six classes. It is also a citation network and is commonly used in graph-based learning tasks.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset includes 19,717 scientific publications related to diabetes research, classified into three categories. It is another popular dataset for evaluating graph-based models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references or can be inferred from the context provided in the paper.

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Since the same reference is used for all three datasets, I will ensure to note that in the dataset entries.

Finally, I will compile the information into structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
