To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransICD: Transformer Based Code-wise Attention Model for Explainable ICD Coding" by Biplob Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MIMIC-III dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the MIMIC-III dataset. They describe it as a benchmark dataset that includes ICU medical records, specifically discharge summaries labeled with ICD-9 codes. The section outlines two settings of the dataset: **MIMIC-III full** and **MIMIC-III 50**. 

1. **MIMIC-III full**: This setting contains 52,726 discharge summaries and 8,929 unique codes, with a significant imbalance in the distribution of ICD codes.
2. **MIMIC-III 50**: This setting consists of the 50 most frequent ICD codes and includes 11,368 discharge summaries. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of samples and unique codes in each split, which is useful for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.W.H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L.A., and Mark, R.G. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1), 160035.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. Identify datasets mentioned in the abstract and introduction.
2. Locate detailed descriptions in the methods or dataset section.
3. Extract key details such as dataset names, sizes, and unique codes.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
