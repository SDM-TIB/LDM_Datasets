To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection on Attributed Graphs" by Atsutoshi Kumagai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using "five real-world attributed graph datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, **Amazon-Photo**, and **Amazon-Computers**. Each dataset is described in terms of its characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, attributes, and classes.

I will summarize the details of each dataset as follows:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, 7 attributes, and 1,433 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 attributes, and 3,703 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 attributes, and 500 classes.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase graph with 7,487 nodes, 119,043 edges, 8 attributes, and 745 classes.
5. **Amazon-Computers**: Another co-purchase graph with 13,381 nodes, 245,778 edges, 10 attributes, and 767 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed are widely used public datasets, and they provide a link to a GitHub repository for further details. However, the specific citations for the Amazon datasets are not provided in the text, so I will note that they are segments of the Amazon co-purchase graph as referenced in the paper by McAuley et al. (2015).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

- **Cora**: 
  > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2017). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. ICLR.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2017). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. ICLR.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2017). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. ICLR.

- **Amazon-Photo**: 
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In SIGIR.

- **Amazon-Computers**: 
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In SIGIR.

Finally, I will ensure that all the extracted information is organized and ready for further processing or review.
