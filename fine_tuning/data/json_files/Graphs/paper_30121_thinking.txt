To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Self-Supervision using Patch-based Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Image Segmentation" by Nicklas Boserup and Raghavendra Selvan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two histopathology datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data & Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **MoNuSeg**: This dataset is from MICCAI 2018 and contains 37 training images and 14 testing images, all at a resolution of 1000 × 1000 pixels. The dataset includes dense annotations of all nuclei in the images.

2. **CoNSeP**: This dataset consists of 27 training images and 14 testing images, also at a resolution of 1000 × 1000 pixels, with dense annotations of all nuclei.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MoNuSeg**, the citation is:
  > N. Kumar, R. Verma, S. Sharma, S. Bhargava, A. Vahadane, and A. Sethi. *A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 36(7):1550–1560, 2017. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2017.2677499.

- For **CoNSeP**, the citation is:
  > S. Graham, Q. D. Vu, S. E. A. Raza, A. Azam, Y. W. Tsang, J. T. Kwak, and N. Rajpoot. *Hover-net: Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in multi-tissue histology images*. Medical Image Analysis, 58:101563, 2019. doi: 10.1016/j.media.2019.101563.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
