To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FINETUNA: Fine-tuning Accelerated Molecular Simulations" by Joseph Musielewicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the **Open Catalyst Project**, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of datasets in machine learning for molecular simulations. They specifically mention the **Open Catalyst Project 2020 (OC20) dataset**, which is composed of over 1.2 million DFT relaxations. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they sampled 30 systems from the OC20 validation set. This confirms the use of the OC20 dataset in their experiments.

I will then check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more details about the OC20 dataset's application in their study.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the OC20 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Open Catalyst Project 2020 (OC20) Dataset**:
  > Chanussot, L., Das, A., Goyal, T., Lavril, T., Shuaibi, M., Riviere, M., Tran, K., Heras-Domingo, J., Ho, C., Hu, W., Palizhati, A., Sriram, A., Wood, B., Yoon, J., Parikh, D., Zitnick, C. L., & Ulissi, Z. (2021). Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and Community Challenges. *ACS Catalysis*, 11, 6059â€“6072.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OC20 dataset as it is crucial for proper documentation and referencing in any downstream applications or analyses.
