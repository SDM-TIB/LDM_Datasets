To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning with Heterogeneous Similarity for Distribution Shifts" by Takuro Kutsuna, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on **benchmark datasets that emulate distribution shifts**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. The author explicitly mentions two datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of face images with multiple annotations, specifically used to predict whether a person's hair color is blond or not. The paper provides a contingency table showing the distribution of hair color and gender in the training set.

2. **Camelyon17 Dataset**: This dataset contains histopathological images collected from five hospitals, used to predict whether an image contains tumor tissue. The author describes the dataset's structure and the different splits used for training and testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For the **Camelyon17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koh, P.W., Sagawa, S., Marklund, H., et al. (2021). Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
