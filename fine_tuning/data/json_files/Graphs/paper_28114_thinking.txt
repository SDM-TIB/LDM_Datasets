To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning GAN-based Foveated Reconstruction to Recover Perceptually Important Image Features" by Luca Surace et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "new dataset" for training GAN-based foveated reconstruction, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. In this section, they mention two distinct datasets used for training the GAN:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors state that they used patches from natural images, specifically mentioning that they randomly selected 50 images from each of the 1000 classes in the ImageNet dataset, resulting in a total of 50,000 patches. This dataset is crucial for the generator's training.

2. **Synthesized Dataset**: The paper describes a new dataset created using a texture synthesis method based on psychophysical experiments. This dataset consists of 50,000 synthesized patches that incorporate perceptually important distortions, which are essential for training the discriminator in the GAN.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- For **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

The synthesized dataset does not have a specific citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors, but I will note its description as it is based on their own psychophysical experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
