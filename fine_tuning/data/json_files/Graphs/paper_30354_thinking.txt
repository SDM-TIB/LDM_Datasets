To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning from the Perspective of Graph Spectrum" by Nian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention the datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 6, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they validate their proposed method on five datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, BlogCatalog, and Flickr**. I will take note of these datasets and any specific details provided about them.

I will then look for a **dedicated section or subsection** that discusses the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Appendix D.2**, where they describe the characteristics of each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features.

Here are the details I will extract for each dataset:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 10,556 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 9,228 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 88,651 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network with 5,196 nodes, 343,486 edges, 6 classes, and 8,189 features.
5. **Flickr**: A social network with 7,575 nodes, 479,476 edges, 9 classes, and 12,047 features.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, especially for well-known datasets like Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Cora**:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In ICLR, 2017.

- For **Citeseer**:
  > William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs*. In NeurIPS, 2017.

- For **Pubmed**:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In ICLR, 2017.

- For **BlogCatalog**:
  > Zaiqiao Meng, Shangsong Liang, Hongyan Bao, and Xiangliang Zhang. *Co-embedding Attributed Networks*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 2019.

- For **Flickr**:
  > Zaiqiao Meng, Shangsong Liang, Hongyan Bao, and Xiangliang Zhang. *Co-embedding Attributed Networks*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper.
