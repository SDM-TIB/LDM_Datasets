To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Node Embeddings of Complex Networks" by Arash Dehghan-Kooshkghazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on real-world networks and synthetic graphs, which suggests that there may be datasets used for these experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe four networks used for their experiments:

1. **Mouse Brain Graph**: This dataset represents regions of the mouse brain and their connections via neuronal fiber tracts. The paper notes that this graph contains no triangles, which is a unique feature.

2. **Airports Graph**: This dataset includes information about flights between airports based on a record of over 3.5 million US Domestic Flights from 1990 to 2009. The authors mention that the nodes are represented by airport codes and that the edges are directed with weights representing passenger volumes.

3. **GitHub Graph**: This dataset is a social network of GitHub developers, collected from the public API in June 2019. Nodes correspond to developers who have starred at least 10 repositories, and edges represent mutual follower relationships.

4. **Email-EU Graph**: This dataset is generated from email data of a large European research institution, where edges represent emails sent between individuals.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Mouse Brain Graph**: 
  > Network Repository. *Mouse Brain Graph*. Available at: http://networkrepository.com/bn-mouse-kasthuri-graph-v4.php

- **Airports Graph**: 
  > OpenFlights. *Airports Graph*. Available at: https://github.com/ftheberge/GraphMiningNotebooks/tree/master/Datasets/Airports

- **GitHub Graph**: 
  > Benedek Rozemberczki, et al. *MUSAE: The Multi-Scale Graph Embedding for Social Networks*. Available at: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE

- **Email-EU Graph**: 
  > Stanford Network Analysis Project. *Email-EU Graph*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core-temporal.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
