To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal brain age estimation using interpretable adaptive population-graph learning" by Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **UK Biobank** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of multimodal imaging and non-imaging information for brain age estimation, which reinforces the significance of the UK Biobank dataset.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any details regarding the dataset used for training and evaluation. The authors specify that they use **68 neuroimaging phenotypes and 20 non-imaging phenotypes** from the UK Biobank, which provides a comprehensive dataset for their analysis.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that the UK Biobank is the dataset used for their experiments, providing further validation of its importance in their study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UK Biobank dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **UK Biobank**: 
  > Alfaro-Almagro, F., Jenkinson, M., Bangerter, N.K., Andersson, J.L., Griffanti, L., Douaud, G., Sotiropoulos, S.N., Jbabdi, S., Hernandez-Fernandez, M., Vallee, E., Vidaurre, D., Webster, M., McCarthy, P., Rorden, C., Daducci, A., Alexander, D.C., Zhang, H., Dragonu, I., Matthews, P.M., Miller, K.L., Smith, S.M. "Image processing and Quality Control for the first 10,000 brain imaging datasets from UK Biobank." *NeuroImage* 166, 400â€“424 (2018).

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now prepare to create an entry for the dataset using the specified format. The UK Biobank is the primary dataset used in this research, and it is crucial to include its full citation for proper attribution.
