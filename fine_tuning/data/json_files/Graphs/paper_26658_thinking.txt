To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matrix Shuffle-Exchange Networks for Hard 2D Tasks" by Em¯ıls Ozolin, š, K¯arlis Freivalds, and Agris Šostaks, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed model and its capabilities, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and evaluation sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the capabilities of their model in processing 2D data and mention its application to algorithmic tasks on matrices and graphs. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** (Section 5) closely, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for testing the model. Here, the authors mention evaluating their model on several tasks, including matrix operations and logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku. They specifically refer to using a **Sudoku dataset with hard puzzles** created by Palm et al. (2018) for training and evaluation.

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **appendices** or **references**. In this case, the authors reference the Sudoku dataset and provide a citation for it.

The citation for the Sudoku dataset is:
> Palm, U., Paquet, U., & Winther, O. (2018). Recurrent relational networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 3368–3378).

Additionally, the paper mentions evaluating the model on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification tasks. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Sudoku Dataset**: Used for logical reasoning tasks, specifically for solving Sudoku puzzles.
   - Citation: Palm, U., Paquet, U., & Winther, O. (2018). Recurrent relational networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 3368–3378).

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Used for image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
