To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Dictionaries and Glyphs for Chinese Language Pre-training" by Yuxuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on benchmarks like **CLUE** and **CCLUE**, which suggests that these may be datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their evaluation on two benchmarks: **CLUE** and **CCLUE**. I will need to gather more information about these benchmarks to provide a complete description.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on various tasks within the CLUE benchmark, which includes datasets for text classification and machine reading comprehension. They also introduce a new dataset called **PolyMRC**, which is specifically designed to test models' abilities to distinguish polysemy in Chinese.

Now, I will compile the details for each dataset:

1. **CLUE Benchmark**: This is a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Chinese language understanding that includes multiple datasets for various tasks. The specific datasets within CLUE include:
   - **CMNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
   - **IFLYTEK**: A dataset for long text classification.
   - **TNEWS**: A dataset for short text classification.
   - **AFQMC**: A dataset for semantic similarity.
   - **CLUEWSC 2020**: A dataset for coreference resolution.
   - **CSL**: A dataset for keyword recognition.

   The citation for the CLUE benchmark is:

In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 4762â€“4772, 2020.

2. **CCLUE Benchmark**: This benchmark is designed for evaluating ancient Chinese language understanding and includes tasks such as named entity recognition, short and long sentence classification, and machine reading comprehension.

   The citation for the CCLUE benchmark is:
   > CCLUE. *CCLUE: A General Ancient Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark*. Available at: https://cclue.top.

3. **PolyMRC Dataset**: This is a new dataset introduced in the paper to evaluate models' abilities to distinguish polysemy in Chinese. It consists of entries with multiple meanings and examples from dictionaries.

   The citation for the PolyMRC dataset is:
   > Yuxuan Wang, Jianghui Wang, Dongyan Zhao, and Zilong Zheng. *PolyMRC: A Polysemy Machine Reading Comprehension Task*. In Proceedings of the [specific conference or journal], [pages], [year].

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research. Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review.
