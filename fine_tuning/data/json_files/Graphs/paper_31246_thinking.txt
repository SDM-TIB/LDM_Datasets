To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure Embedded Nucleus Classification for Histopathology Images" by Wei Lou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, the authors explicitly mention four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CRC-FFPE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 16 patients with 59 H&E stained histopathology tiles of size 1000 × 1000. The images are extracted from the WSIs collected from TCGA and annotated by pathologists. The nuclei types include Tumor, Stroma, Immune, Necrosis, and Other.

2. **CoNSeP Dataset**: This dataset contains 41 H&E stained images of size 1000 × 1000, with 24,139 annotated nuclei grouped into four categories: Miscellaneous, Inflammatory, Epithelial, and Spindle-shaped.

3. **MoNuSAC Dataset**: A multi-organ dataset comprising 310 images (209 for training, 101 for testing) of 71 patients, with nuclei types including Epithelial, Lymphocytes, Macrophages, and Neutrophils.

4. **PanNuke Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,899 image tiles of size 256 × 256 from 19 different organs, with nuclei types including Inflammatory, Connective, Dead, Epithelial, and Neoplastic.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CRC-FFPE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). "Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Data." [Online]. Available: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

- For the **CoNSeP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graham, S., et al. "Hover-Net: Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Nuclei in Multi-Tissue Histology Images." *Medical Image Analysis*, vol. 58, p. 101563, 2019.

- For the **MoNuSAC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Verma, R., et al. "MoNuSAC2020: A Multi-Organ Nuclei Segmentation and Classification Challenge." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, vol. 40, no. 12, pp. 3413–3423, 2021.

- For the **PanNuke Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gamper, J., et al. "PanNuke Dataset Extension, Insights and Baselines." arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10778, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This will allow for easy reference and further exploration of the datasets used in the study.
