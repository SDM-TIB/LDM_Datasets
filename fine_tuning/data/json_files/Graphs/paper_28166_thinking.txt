To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multivariate and Propagation Graph Attention Network for Spatial-Temporal Prediction with Outdoor Cellular Traffic" by Chung-Yi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper addresses outdoor cellular traffic data collected from a telecom company, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of collecting traffic data without sensors and mention the use of outdoor cellular traffic as an alternative. This reinforces the idea that they have created a dataset based on cellular traffic records.

In the **dataset description section (Section 2)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They describe it as a spatial-temporal dataset derived from outdoor cellular traffic, specifically mentioning that it includes IMEI quantities aggregated at six road intersections over time steps of 5 minutes. This section is crucial as it provides the specifics of the dataset, including its structure and the nature of the data collected.

The paper also mentions that the dataset is available on GitHub, which is a significant detail for citation purposes. I will note the URL provided for accessing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work regarding the dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Chung-Yi Lin, Hung-Ting Su, Shen-Lung Tung, and Winston H. Hsu. *Multivariate and Propagation Graph Attention Network for Spatial-Temporal Prediction with Outdoor Cellular Traffic*. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM ’21), November 1–5, 2021, Virtual Event, QLD, Australia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 5 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482152

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
