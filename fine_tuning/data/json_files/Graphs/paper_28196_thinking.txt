To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alleviating Exposure Bias via Contrastive Learning for Abstractive Text Summarization" by Shichao Sun and Wenjie Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list three datasets: **XSum**, **CNNDM**, and **Multi-News**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, as they will help in understanding their characteristics and applications.

In the paper, the authors describe:
1. **XSum**: A dataset designed for single-document summarization, where each news article is associated with a single-sentence summary.
2. **CNNDM**: A collection of news articles with multiple highlights as summaries, used for single-document summarization.
3. **Multi-News**: A multi-document summarization dataset consisting of news articles and human-written summaries, typically longer than those in CNNDM.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

- For **CNNDM**, the citation is:
  > Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Cicero dos Santos, Çağlar Güçlühçe, and Bing Xiang. *Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond*. In Proceedings of The 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 280–290, Berlin, Germany, 2016.

- For **Multi-News**, the citation is:
  > Alexander Fabbri, Irene Li, Tianwei She, Suyi Li, and Dragomir Radev. *Multi-news: A large-scale multi-document summarization dataset and abstractive hierarchical model*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1074–1084, Florence, Italy, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
