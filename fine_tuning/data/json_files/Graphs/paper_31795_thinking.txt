To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Group Unfairness: Measurement and Mitigation by means of the Effective Resistance" by Georgina Curto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on real-world networks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or descriptions that explicitly list the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Facebook dataset**: A dense graph of 1,034 Facebook users and 26,749 edges, representing a large ego-network where nodes are connected if they are friends in the social network.

2. **UNC28 dataset**: A snapshot from the Facebook network of the University of North Carolina, consisting of 3,985 nodes and 65,287 edges.

3. **Google+ dataset**: An ego-network from the Google+ social network, containing 3,508 nodes and 25,930 edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Facebook dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Mcauley, J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 25.

- For the **UNC28 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Red, V., Kelsic, E. D., Mucha, P. J., & Porter, M. A. (2011). Comparing community structure to characteristics in online collegiate social networks. *SIAM Review*, 53(3), 526-543.

- For the **Google+ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Mcauley, J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 25.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future use or analysis.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the datasets and their citations from the paper, allowing for proper acknowledgment and facilitating further research.
