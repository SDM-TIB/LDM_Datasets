To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Energy Based Representations of Quantum Many-Body States" by Abhijith Jayakumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research. In the abstract, the authors discuss the representation of quantum states and the learning methods applied, which may hint at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. I will pay special attention to any figures or tables that may reference datasets or provide data samples.

In the **results section**, the authors may describe specific experiments conducted on various quantum states, and they might mention the datasets used for these experiments. For instance, if they refer to datasets derived from specific quantum systems or simulations, I will note these down.

I will also check the **appendices** for any supplementary information regarding datasets. Sometimes, additional details about the datasets, such as their sources or how they were generated, are provided in the appendices.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Transverse Field Ising Model (TIM) dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset and provide the full citation.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the datasets utilized in the study.
