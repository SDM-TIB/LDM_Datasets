To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Prediction of COVID-19 Variant Emergence Using Dynamics-Informed Graph Neural Networks" by Majd Al Aawar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions a benchmarking tool for evaluating variant emergence prediction over **87 countries and 36 variants**, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three primary datasets:

1. **CoVariants Dataset**: This dataset provides information on the current state of variants and mutations of interest for SARS-CoV-2, covering data from August 2020 to October 2023. It is enabled by GISAID and follows the NextStrain Clade schema.

2. **OxCGRT Dataset**: This dataset contains information on border restrictions enacted by governments from January 1, 2020, to January 8, 2023. It measures variations in government responses using a COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index.

3. **Country Adjacency Dataset**: This dataset represents the interconnection between countries based on geographical proximity and shared borders, sourced from the Correlates of War (CoW) database.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations I find are:

- For the **CoVariants Dataset**:
  > E. B. Hodcroft. "CoVariants: SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variants of interest." 2021.

- For the **OxCGRT Dataset**:
  > T. Hale et al. "A global panel database of pandemic policies (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker)." Nature Human Behaviour, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 529â€“538, 2021.

- For the **Country Adjacency Dataset**:
  > P1sec. "Country adjacency." 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
