To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model and Evaluation: Towards Fairness in Multilingual Text Classification" by Nankai Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a focus on multilingual text classification and a debiasing framework, which suggests that datasets related to multilingual text classification might be discussed.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of bias in multilingual models and reference existing datasets for multilingual fairness research. However, I need to find the exact names and details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention using a multilingual hate speech classification dataset collected from tweets in multiple languages, including English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the work by Huang et al. (2020) regarding the multilingual hate speech dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

- Huang, X., Xing, L., Dernoncourt, F., & Paul, M. J. (2020). *Multilingual Twitter Corpus and Baselines for Evaluating Demographic Bias in Hate Speech Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 1440â€“1448, Marseille, France.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Multilingual Hate Speech Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets annotated with hate speech labels and user profiles across multiple languages (English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish). It allows for the evaluation of demographic bias in hate speech detection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
