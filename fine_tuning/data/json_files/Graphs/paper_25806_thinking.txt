To extract datasets from the research paper titled "N-GCN: Multi-scale Graph Convolution for Semi-supervised Node Classification" by Sami Abu-El-Haija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors evaluate their method on several node classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Citeseer**: A citation graph dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes. The dataset is prepared by the authors of a referenced work.
   
2. **Cora**: Another citation graph dataset consisting of 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. This dataset is also prepared by the authors of a referenced work.

3. **Pubmed**: This dataset contains 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes. The preparation of this dataset is attributed to the authors of a referenced work.

4. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions)**: A biological graph dataset with 56,944 nodes, 818,716 edges, and 121 classes. The dataset is prepared by the authors of a referenced work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are used for their evaluations, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Wang, J., & Yang, J. (2008). *Collective classification in networked data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A., & Nigam, S. (1998). *A comparison of event models for naive Bayes text classification*. In Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., & Pedersen, J. O. (1997). *A comparative study on feature selection in text categorization*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For **PPI**, the citation is:
  > Hamilton, W., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
