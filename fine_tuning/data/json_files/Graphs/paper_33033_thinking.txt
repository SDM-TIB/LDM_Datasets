To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Medi-CAT: Contrastive Adversarial Training for Medical Image Classification" by Pervaiz Iqbal Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on four medical image classification datasets from the MedMNIST collection, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets from the MedMNIST collection, providing details about each:

1. **DermaMNIST**: This dataset consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification. It has 7 classes and a total of 10,015 samples, with a training/validation/test split of 7,007/1,003/2,005.

2. **OrganAMNIST**: This dataset contains abdominal CT images for organ classification. It has 11 classes and a total of 58,850 samples, with a training/validation/test split of 34,581/6,491/17,778.

3. **OrganCMNIST**: Similar to OrganAMNIST, this dataset also consists of abdominal CT images for organ classification, with 11 classes and a total of 23,660 samples, split into 13,000/2,392/8,268 for training/validation/test.

4. **OrganSMNIST**: This dataset includes abdominal CT images as well, with 11 classes and a total of 25,221 samples, with a training/validation/test split of 13,940/2,452/8,829.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the MedMNIST collection. The relevant citation for the MedMNIST dataset collection is:

- Yang, J., Shi, R., Wei, D., Liu, Z., Zhao, L., Ke, B., Pfister, H., Ni, B. (2023). *MedMNIST v2 - a large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification*. Scientific Data, 10(1), 41.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
