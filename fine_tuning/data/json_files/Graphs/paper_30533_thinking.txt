To extract datasets from the research paper titled "All the Feels: A dexterous hand with large-area tactile sensing" by Raunaq Bhirangi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the D’Manus hand and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) and the **data collection section** (Section V). In these sections, the authors describe their experimental setup and the data collection methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including how they were collected and what they contain.

In Section V, the authors detail their data collection process for tactile interaction data. They mention collecting data from various objects using the D’Manus hand, which indicates that there are datasets related to tactile interactions. They describe the setup and the types of data collected, but I need to ensure I capture the specific datasets mentioned.

I will also check the **results section** (Section VI) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted, such as material identification, softness classification, and texture classification tasks. This will help confirm the datasets used and their relevance to the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "ReSkin interaction data" or any specific datasets used for training their models, I will ensure to note these down along with their citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, the type of data it contains, and the full citation for each dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
