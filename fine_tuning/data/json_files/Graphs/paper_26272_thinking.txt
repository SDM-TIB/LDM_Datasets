To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeGNN: Characterizing and Improving Graph Neural Networks with Graph Decomposition" by Xupeng Miao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, features, edges, classes, and the type of tasks they are used for (e.g., transductive or inductive).

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2017). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. In ICLR.

2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes. The citation is the same as for Cora.

3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes. The citation is also the same as for Cora.

4. **Reddit**: A social network dataset used for inductive learning. The citation is:
   > Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In NIPS.

5. **Flickr**: A dataset containing images based on descriptions and properties. The citation is:
   > Knyazev, B., Lin, X., Amer, M. R., & Taylor, G. W. (2018). Spectral multigraph networks for discovering and fusing relationships in molecules. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.09595.

6. **Amazon Computer** and **Amazon Photo**: Segments of the Amazon co-purchase graph. The citation is:
   > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In SIGIR.

7. **Coauthor CS** and **Coauthor Physics**: Co-authorship graphs based on the Microsoft Academic Graph. The citation is:
   > KDD Cup 2016 Challenge. (2016). Microsoft Academic Graph.

8. **Actor**: An actor-only induced subgraph of the film-director-actor-writer network. The citation is:
   > Tang, J., et al. (2009). Social influence analysis in large-scale networks. In KDD.

9. **Company Small** and **Company Large**: Real-world transaction graphs for fraud detection. The citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is based on historical transaction records.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
