To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Interpretation and Validation of Graph Attention-based Explanations for GNN Models" by Efimia Panagiotaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a lidar pointcloud estimation model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to lidar or pointcloud data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of pose estimation and the methodologies they are using. They mention the **KITTI Odometry Dataset** as the baseline for their model, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their approach on the **KITTI Odometry Dataset** and also reference the **SemanticKITTI dataset** for generating semantic graphs and evaluating performance. This indicates that both datasets are used in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **KITTI Odometry Dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, 2012.

2. For the **SemanticKITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Behley, M. Garbade, A. Milioto, J. Quenzel, S. Behnke, C. Stachniss, and J. Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of LiDAR sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 9296–9306, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **KITTI Odometry Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the SEM-GAT model in the context of pose estimation. It provides ground-truth labels and poses for various sequences.

- **SemanticKITTI Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for generating semantic graphs and evaluating the performance of the SEM-GAT model. It contains labeled LiDAR sequences for semantic scene understanding.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
