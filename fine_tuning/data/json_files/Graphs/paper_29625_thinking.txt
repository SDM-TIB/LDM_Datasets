To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Sequential Recommendation with Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yixin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments in **Table 1**, which lists the statistics of the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It includes user reviews and ratings across various categories. The specific subsets used are "Home and Kitchen" and "Cell Phones and Accessories."

2. **Goodreads Review Dataset**: This dataset is also utilized for evaluation, focusing on users' rating behaviors in the "Poetry" and "Comics" categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 507–517, 2016.

- For the **Goodreads Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra, Ndapandula Nakashole, and Julian McAuley. *Fine-grained spoiler detection from large-scale review corpora*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 2605–2610, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
