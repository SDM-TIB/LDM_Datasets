To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Code Retrieval and Summarization via Semantic-Preserving Transformations" by Nghi D. Q. Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or training. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using labeled data for code retrieval and summarization tasks, which may lead to the mention of datasets that they have utilized or created for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments, which are crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

From the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **OJ Dataset**: This dataset contains 52,000 C programs with 104 classes, resulting in 500 programs per class. The authors mention that they translated this dataset from C++ to Java for their experiments.

2. **BigCloneBench (BCB) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25,000 Java projects, covering 10 functionalities and including 6,000,000 true clone pairs and 260,000 false clone pairs. It is widely used for code clone detection tasks.

3. **JavaSmall Dataset**: This dataset comprises 11 relatively large Java projects from GitHub, containing about 700,000 examples.

   Full citation:

4. **JavaMed Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,000 top-starred Java projects from GitHub, which contains about 4 million examples.

   Full citation:
   > Alon, U., Zilberstein, M., Levy, O., & Yahav, E. (2019). Code2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code. In POPL (pp. 40:1-40:29).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
