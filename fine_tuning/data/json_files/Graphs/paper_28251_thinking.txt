To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preservational Learning Improves Self-supervised Medical Image Models by Reconstructing Diverse Contexts" by Hong-Yu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of self-supervised learning in medical image analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two types of tasks: 2D and 3D tasks, and they specify the datasets used for each.

For the **2D tasks**, the authors mention:
1. **Chest14 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 112,120 X-ray images with 14 diseases from 30,805 unique patients. It is used for both pretraining and finetuning.
2. **CheXpert Dataset**: A large public dataset containing 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients, primarily used for pretraining.

For the **3D tasks**, the authors mention:
1. **LUNA Dataset**: This dataset contains 888 CT scans with lung nodule annotations, used for both pretraining and finetuning.
2. **BraTS Dataset**: This dataset includes 351 MRI scans of brain tumors, used for finetuning.
3. **LiTS Dataset**: This dataset contains 131 CT scans with annotations for liver and tumor segmentation, primarily used for finetuning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Chest14**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
