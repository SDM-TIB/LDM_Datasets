To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment-Aware Word and Sentence Level Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis" by Shuai Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various sentiment classification benchmarks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a detailed list of datasets, including:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentence-level sentiment classification and consists of 8,544 training samples, 1,101 validation samples, and 2,210 test samples.

2. **IMDB**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for sentiment analysis, containing 22,500 training samples and 25,000 test samples.

3. **Movie Review (MR)**: This dataset includes 8,534 training samples, 1,078 validation samples, and 1,050 test samples.

4. **Yelp-2**: This dataset consists of 504,000 training samples and 56,000 test samples, used for binary sentiment classification.

5. **Yelp-5**: Similar to Yelp-2, but with five sentiment classes, it contains 594,000 training samples and 50,000 test samples.

6. **Restaurant14 (Res14)**: This dataset is used for aspect-level sentiment classification, with 2,163 training samples, 150 validation samples, and 638 test samples.

7. **Laptop14 (Lap14)**: Another aspect-level sentiment classification dataset, containing 3,452 training samples, 150 validation samples, and 676 test samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For example, the citation for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is:
> Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631â€“1642.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure I have accurate and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
