To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Learning on Evolving Graphs Under the Constraints of Imbalanced Classes and New Classes" by Lukas Galke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of lifelong graph learning and hints at the use of specific datasets for experiments, which may be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Datasets and Analyses)**, as this section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize dataset characteristics, as they often provide concise information about the datasets, including their names, features, and sizes.

In **subsection 5.1 (Static Graph Datasets)**, the authors mention three standard datasets: 

1. **Cora**: A dataset with 7 classes, 2,708 vertices, and 5,278 edges.
2. **Citeseer**: A dataset with 6 classes, 3,327 vertices, and 4,552 edges.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 3 classes, 19,717 vertices, and 44,324 edges.

In **subsection 5.2 (Evolving Graph Datasets)**, the authors introduce three datasets they contributed:

1. **DBLP-easy**: A co-authorship graph dataset with 45,407 vertices, 112,131 edges, and 12 classes (4 new).
2. **DBLP-hard**: Another co-authorship graph dataset with 198,675 vertices, 643,734 edges, and 73 classes (23 new).
3. **PharmaBio**: A dataset with 68,068 vertices, 2,1M edges, and 7 classes (no new classes).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the text, especially for datasets that are well-known or widely used in the community. However, if the datasets are derived from specific papers or repositories, I will ensure to include those references.

For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3).

For the **Citeseer dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3).

For the **Pubmed dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3).

For the **DBLP datasets**, the citations are:
> Galke, L., Franke, B., Zielke, T., & Scherp, A. (2021). Lifelong learning of graph neural networks for open-world node classification. In IJCNN. IEEE.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, characteristics, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
