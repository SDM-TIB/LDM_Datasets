To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs" by Christopher Morris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of the TUDataset collection, which consists of over 120 datasets for graph classification and regression. This indicates that multiple datasets are present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The TUDataset collection)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets included in the collection. I will look for specific names and characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

In **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe various domains and types of datasets. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **NCI1**: A dataset of chemical compounds used for predicting activity against cancer.
2. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for predicting protein functions based on their structure.
3. **ENZYMES**: A dataset for classifying enzymes into different classes.
4. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A dataset derived from Reddit discussions for binary classification tasks.
5. **ZINC**: A dataset for molecular regression tasks.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm which datasets were used in their evaluations. The authors mention using datasets like **NCI1**, **PROTEINS**, **ENZYMES**, and others for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. For example, the citation for the **NCI1 dataset** is:

- Wale, N., Watson, I. A., & Karypis, G. (2008). Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification. *Knowledge and Information Systems*, 14(3), 347-375.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I have the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
