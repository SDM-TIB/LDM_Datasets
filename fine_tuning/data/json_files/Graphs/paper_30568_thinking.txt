To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A State-Augmented Approach for Learning Optimal Resource Management Decisions in Wireless Networks" by YiË˜git Berkay Uslu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of radio resource management (RRM) in wireless networks and mention various approaches, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **problem formulation and proposed algorithm sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** closely. Here, the authors describe the setup for their experiments, including the parameters and configurations used. They mention that they applied their state-augmented algorithm to a power control problem, but I need to look for specific datasets used for training or testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the network configurations and parameters used in their simulations, such as the number of users, channel models, and performance metrics. This indicates that the experiments were likely conducted using synthetic data generated based on the described models rather than established datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any prior works are referenced that may have used datasets relevant to this research. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers discussing methodologies and algorithms rather than datasets.

Given this analysis, I conclude that there are no specific datasets extracted from this paper. Instead, the authors rely on simulated data based on their proposed models. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and experiments, it does not provide citations for any datasets.

In summary, I will document my findings, emphasizing that the research does not utilize any publicly available datasets, and instead relies on synthetic data generated from the described models. If any relevant datasets were mentioned in the references, I would include those citations, but in this case, there are none directly related to datasets.
