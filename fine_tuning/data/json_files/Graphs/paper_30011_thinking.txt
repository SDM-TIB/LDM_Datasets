To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Graph Neural Networks for Program Termination" by Yoav Alon and Cristina David, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental evaluation. In **subsection 4.2 (Binary classification of program termination)**, they mention using four datasets for classification:

1. **DS-SV-COMP**: This dataset contains C programs from the termination category of the SV-COMP 2022 competition, specifically including various subcategories. It consists of 55 nonterminating and 194 terminating programs, totaling 249 programs.

2. **DS-TERM-COMP**: This dataset includes 150 C programs from the Termination Competition, with a total of 452 loops. It is designed to have no overlap with the DS-SV-COMP dataset.

3. **DS1**: A custom dataset containing 950 C programs, labeled for termination behavior through fuzz testing. It is balanced with an equal number of terminating and nonterminating samples.

4. **DS2**: Another custom dataset with 950 generated Python programs, split into 800 for training and 150 for testing, also labeled through fuzz testing.

In **subsection 4.3 (Semantic segmentation of nodes causing nontermination)**, the authors describe two additional datasets specifically for semantic segmentation:

1. **DS-Seg-Py1**: This dataset consists of Python programs, with 180 programs for training and 50 for testing, focusing on identifying the outermost nonterminating loops.

2. **DS-Seg-C**: This dataset contains C programs, also with 180 training and 50 testing programs, similarly aimed at semantic segmentation for nontermination.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets based on existing benchmarks are:

- For **DS-SV-COMP**:
  > Dirk Beyer. 2022. Competition on Software Verification. In Proceedings of the 2022 Software Verification Competition. https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2022/

- For **DS-TERM-COMP**:
  > Jürgen Giesl, Fred Mesnard, Albert Rubio, René Thiemann, and Johannes Waldmann. 2015. Termination Competition (termCOMP 2015). In Proceedings of the 2015 Termination Competition. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_6

For the custom datasets (DS1 and DS2), since they are generated by the authors, they may not have formal citations but can be referenced as follows:

- For **DS1**:
  > Alon, Y., & David, C. (2022). Custom dataset DS1 for program termination analysis.

- For **DS2**:
  > Alon, Y., & David, C. (2022). Custom dataset DS2 for program termination analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
