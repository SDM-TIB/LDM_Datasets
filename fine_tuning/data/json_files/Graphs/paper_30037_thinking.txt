To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Person Clustering Algorithm for Open Checkout-free Groceries" by Junde Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "publicly released large-scale real-world check-out free grocery dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset that needs to be documented.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets they collected. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DaiCOFG**: This dataset contains 362,300 snapshots with 10,176 identities for training and 250,710 labeled snapshots with 7,406 identities for testing. It was collected from a large grocery store using 186 cameras.

2. **IseCOFG**: This dataset consists of 78,630 snapshots with 4,116 identities for training and 54,606 snapshots with 2,773 identities for testing. It was collected from a smaller grocery store using 76 cameras.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are newly collected by the authors and not previously published, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

For the **DaiCOFG dataset**, I will document:
- Dataset Name: DaiCOFG
- Description: Contains 362,300 snapshots with 10,176 identities for training and 250,710 labeled snapshots with 7,406 identities for testing, collected from a large grocery store with 186 cameras.

For the **IseCOFG dataset**, I will document:
- Dataset Name: IseCOFG
- Description: Contains 78,630 snapshots with 4,116 identities for training and 54,606 snapshots with 2,773 identities for testing, collected from a smaller grocery store with 76 cameras.

Since these datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source for both datasets:

- For **DaiCOFG** and **IseCOFG**, the citation is:
  > Junde Wu, Yu Zhang, Rao Fu, Yuanpei Liu, and Jing Gao. *An Efficient Person Clustering Algorithm for Open Checkout-free Groceries*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the information for future reference or processing.
