To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoDiM: Learning with Noisy Labels via Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning" by Xin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset and Experimental Setup**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, categorized into 10 classes. The authors reference the original paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2009) for this dataset.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it is divided into 100 classes. The same reference by Krizhevsky et al. (2009) is applicable here as well.

3. **ANIMAL-10N**: This dataset includes 55,000 noisy human-labeled images of animals, which is referenced from the work by Song et al. (2019).

4. **WebVision**: This dataset contains 2.4 million images collected from the web, categorized into 1,000 classes based on ImageNet. The authors cite Li et al. (2017) for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ANIMAL-10N**, the citation is:
  > Song, H., Kim, M., and Lee, J.-G. *Selfie: Refurbishing unclean samples for robust deep learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, 5907â€“5915, 2019.

- For **WebVision**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Wang, L., Li, W., Agustsson, E., and Gool, L. V. *WebVision Database: Visual Learning and Understanding from Web Data*. CoRR, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
