To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Technical Report of 2023 ABO Fine-grained Semantic Segmentation Competition" by Zeyu Dong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the competition involves semantic segmentation of 3D models, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the significance of 3D image semantic segmentation in e-commerce and mentions the use of 3D models. This reinforces the idea that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **section II (2023 ABO Fine-grained Semantic Segmentation Competition)**, where the author explicitly mentions the **Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) Dataset**. This dataset is described as containing high-quality 3D models of real products available for purchase online, which is crucial for the competition's objectives.

I will also check the **dataset section** where the author elaborates on the components of the ABO dataset, indicating that it includes 3D images of various objects categorized into five classes: chair, bed, lamp, storage furniture, and table. This section provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the ABO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Collins, S. Goel, K. Deng, A. Luthra, L. Xu, E. Gundogdu, X. Zhang, T. F. Y. Vicente, T. Dideriksen, H. Arora, et al. "ABO: Dataset and benchmarks for real-world 3D object understanding." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 21126â€“21136, 2022.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ABO dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output.
