To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Relation Learning with Semantic Correlation Awareness for Link Prediction" by Yao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments on six benchmarks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **YAGO3-10**: This dataset is referenced as a knowledge graph derived from Wikipedia and WordNet, containing entities and relations.
2. **FB15K-237**: A subset of the Freebase dataset, which is commonly used for link prediction tasks.
3. **NELL-995**: A dataset designed for few-shot learning tasks in knowledge graphs.
4. **Kinship**: A dataset that represents familial relationships, often used in knowledge graph research.
5. **WN18**: A dataset derived from WordNet, used for evaluating link prediction models.
6. **NELL-ONE**: A dataset specifically constructed for few-shot learning tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **YAGO3-10**: 
  > Mahdisoltani, F., Biega, J., & Suchanek, F. (2015). YAGO3: A Knowledge Base from Multilingual Wikipedias. In Proceedings of CIDR.

- **FB15K-237**:

- **NELL-995**: 
  > Xiong, W., Hoang, T., & Wang, W. Y. (2017). DeepPath: A Reinforcement Learning Method for Knowledge Graph Reasoning. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

- **Kinship**:

- **WN18**:

- **NELL-ONE**: 
  > Xiong, W., Yu, M., Chang, S., Guo, X., & Wang, W. Y. (2018). One-Shot Relational Learning for Knowledge Graphs. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
