To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chaos is a Ladder: A New Theoretical Understanding of Contrastive Learning via Augmentation Overlap" by Yifei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they evaluate their proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which typically includes the datasets used. I will focus on sections that detail the experimental setup, as they often contain specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **STL-10**: A dataset for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 5,000 labeled training images and 8,000 unlabeled images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the AISTATS, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
