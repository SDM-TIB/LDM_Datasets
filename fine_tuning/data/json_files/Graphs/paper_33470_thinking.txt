To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Professional Network Matters: Connections Empower Person-Job Fit" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental evaluations across three real-world recruitment datasets from LinkedIn, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets categorized by industry:

1. **Tech Dataset**: This dataset includes members and jobs from the technology industry, comprising 33,000 members and 62,000 jobs.

2. **Finance Dataset**: This dataset consists of members and jobs from the finance industry, with 20,000 members and 27,000 jobs.

3. **Hybrid Dataset**: This dataset encompasses members and jobs from various industries, including healthcare, education, and semiconductors, featuring 83,000 members and 120,000 jobs.

The authors also provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of skills, candidate pairs, and professional connections, which further confirms the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are proprietary and derived from LinkedIn, the authors do not provide specific citations for them. Instead, they mention that the skills, schools, and companies in the datasets come from explicit annotations by members or jobs on LinkedIn, but they cannot disclose further detailed information to protect user privacy.

Given this context, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Tech Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains members and jobs from the technology industry.
   - Members: 33,000
   - Jobs: 62,000
   - Skills: 27,000
   - Candidate Pairs: 136,000
   - Professional Connections: 1,922,000

2. **Finance Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains members and jobs from the finance industry.
   - Members: 20,000
   - Jobs: 27,000
   - Skills: 23,000
   - Candidate Pairs: 36,000
   - Professional Connections: 615,000

3. **Hybrid Dataset**: 
   - Description: Includes members and jobs from various industries.
   - Members: 83,000
   - Jobs: 120,000
   - Skills: 33,000
   - Candidate Pairs: 200,000
   - Professional Connections: 2,768,000

Since the datasets are derived from LinkedIn and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are proprietary datasets from LinkedIn without specific references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the proprietary nature of the datasets and the lack of formal citations.
