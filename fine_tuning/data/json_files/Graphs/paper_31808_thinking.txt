To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Causal Scene Refinement for Video Question Answering" by Yushen Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: **NExT-QA**, **Causal-VidQA**, and **MSRVTT-QA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **NExT-QA**: This dataset is described as containing 5,440 videos and 47,692 QA pairs, focusing on causal and temporal reasoning in video content.

2. **Causal-VidQA**: This dataset consists of 107,600 QA pairs and 26,900 video clips, emphasizing evidence and commonsense reasoning in real-world actions.

3. **MSRVTT-QA**: This dataset includes 10,000 trimmed video clips and 243,680 QA pairs, designed to assess visual scene-sensing abilities through descriptive questions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NExT-QA**, the citation is:
  > Junbin Xiao, Xindi Shang, Angela Yao, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Next-QA: Next Phase of Question-Answering to Explaining Temporal Actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9777–9786, 2021.

- For **Causal-VidQA**, the citation is:
  > Jiangtong Li, Li Niu, and Liqing Zhang. *From Representation to Reasoning: Towards both Evidence and Commonsense Reasoning for Video Question-Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 21273–21282, 2022.

- For **MSRVTT-QA**, the citation is:
  > Xin Yu, Zhenhua Ling, and Jianwei Zhang. *MSRVTT: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Video-to-Text Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 243–250, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
