To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter-Efficient Neural Question Answering Models via Graph-Enriched Document Representations" by Louis Castricato et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **HotPotQA dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors discuss the application of their model to the **HotPotQA dataset** for multi-document question answering. This confirms that this dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their model's architecture and how it processes the data from the **HotPotQA dataset**. They mention that the dataset is used for evaluating their model's performance, which further solidifies its importance.

I will then check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. However, the focus remains on the **HotPotQA dataset** throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **HotPotQA dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **HotPotQA Dataset**:
  > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, and Saizheng Zhang. *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 1-8, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing.
