To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUGAR: Subgraph Neural Network with Reinforcement Pooling and Self-Supervised Mutual Information Mechanism" by Qingyun Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **six typical bioinformatics datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset containing 188 graphs, used for classifying whether compounds have a mutagenic effect on bacteria.
2. **PTC**: A dataset with 344 graphs, used for predicting the carcinogenicity of organic molecules.
3. **PROTEINS**: This dataset consists of 1113 graphs, used for protein function prediction.
4. **D&D**: A dataset with 1178 graphs, used for predicting enzyme functions.
5. **NCI1**: A dataset containing 4110 graphs, used for drug discovery.
6. **NCI109**: This dataset has 4127 graphs, also used for drug discovery.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **MUTAG**:

- **PTC**:

- **PROTEINS**:

- **D&D**: 
  > Paul D Dobson and Andrew J Doig. *Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments*. Journal of molecular biology, 2003.

- **NCI1**: 
  > Nikil Wale, Ian A Watson, and George Karypis. *Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification*. Knowledge and Information Systems, 2008.

- **NCI109**: 
  > Nikil Wale, Ian A Watson, and George Karypis. *Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification*. Knowledge and Information Systems, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
