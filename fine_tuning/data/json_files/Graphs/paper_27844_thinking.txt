To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST++: Make Self-training Work Better for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Yinghuan Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of semi-supervised semantic segmentation and references specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in **section 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset is composed of 1464 images for training and 1449 images for validation, with additional augmentation from the SBD dataset, resulting in a total of 10,582 training images.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset contains 2975 images with fine-grained masks for training and 500 images for validation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, S. M. Ali Eslami, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: A dataset with 10,582 training images after augmentation.
   - Citation: Mark Everingham et al. (2015).

2. **Cityscapes**: A dataset with 2975 training images and 500 validation images.
   - Citation: Marius Cordts et al. (2016).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
