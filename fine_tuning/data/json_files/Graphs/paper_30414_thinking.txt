To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose-Guided Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Han Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **NTU RGB+D 60** and **NTU RGB+D 120** datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset contains 56,000 action clips across 60 action classes, featuring 40 volunteers. Each clip is captured by three Kinect cameras from different angles, providing 3D skeleton sequences and corresponding 2D pose coordinates.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, it includes 114,480 action clips for 120 classes and features 106 volunteers. Similar to the previous dataset, it provides 3D skeleton sequences and 2D pose coordinates.

The authors also mention the benchmarks for both datasets, which further confirms their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10):2684–2701, 2019.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
