To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effects of Randomness on the Stability of Node Embeddings" by Tobias Schumacher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on node embedding algorithms and their stability, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Framework)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention both **synthetic and empirical graphs**. The synthetic graphs include Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz models, which are generated for the purpose of the study. However, I need to focus on the empirical datasets that are explicitly named.

The authors list the following empirical datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset models relationships among users of the BlogCatalog website, where each user is represented as a node. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU. Retrieved from http://socialcomputing.asu.edu.

2. **Cora**: This is a well-known citation network where each scientific paper is represented as a node, and directed edges indicate citations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Å ubelj, L., & Bajec, M. (2013). Model of complex networks based on citation dynamics. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (pp. 527-530). ACM.

3. **Facebook**: This dataset models the social network structure of verified government sites on Facebook. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rozemberczki, B., Davies, R., Sarkar, R., & Sutton, C. (2018). Gemsec: Graph embedding with self clustering. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03997.

4. **Protein**: This biological network models protein interactions in humans. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Stark, C., Breitkreutz, B.-J., Reguly, T., Boucher, L., Breitkreutz, A., & Tyers, M. (2006). Biogrid: a general repository for interaction datasets. Nucleic Acids Research, 34(suppl_1), D535-D539.

5. **Wikipedia**: This network represents the co-occurrence of words within a dump of Wikipedia articles. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mahoney, M. (2011). Large text compression benchmark. Retrieved from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
