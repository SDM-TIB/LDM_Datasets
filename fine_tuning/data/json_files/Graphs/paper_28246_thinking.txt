To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence Level Contrastive Learning for Text Summarization" by Shusheng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors improved upon a strong sequence-to-sequence text generation model on three different summarization datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset contains news articles and their associated highlights, with a total of 287,226 articles for training, 13,368 for validation, and 11,490 for testing.

2. **New York Times Dataset (NYT)**: Composed of articles published by the New York Times, this dataset includes 110,540 articles with summaries, with a final test set containing 3,452 articles after filtering.

3. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset consists of articles from the BBC website, each accompanied by a single sentence summary, with 204,045 articles for training, 11,332 for validation, and 11,334 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (Vol. 28, pp. 1693–1701).

- For the **New York Times Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sandhaus, E. (2008). The New York Times Annotated Corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

- For the **XSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset entry is accurately represented, including the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
