To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Online One-Class Incremental Learning by Removing Negative Contrasts" by Nader Asadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their research problem, which can provide clues about their names and characteristics.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setup or datasets. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors typically summarize the datasets used for training and evaluation. This is where I will confirm the datasets mentioned earlier and gather additional details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Split CIFAR-10** and **Split CIFAR-100** datasets, I will look for their citations in the references. The citations may look something like this:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
