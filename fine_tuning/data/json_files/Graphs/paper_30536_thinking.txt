To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MABEL: Attenuating Gender Bias using Textual Entailment Data" by Jacqueline He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "entailment pairs from natural language inference (NLI) datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets being utilized. I will note this down as a potential area to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their approach. In section 3.1, they explicitly mention using two well-known NLI datasets: **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** and **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant statistics provided.

In addition to the NLI datasets, I will also check the **evaluation metrics section** and the **experiments section** for any other datasets that may have been used for evaluation. The authors mention using the **Bias-in-Bios** dataset, which is annotated by occupation and gender, and the **WinoBias** dataset, which is used for coreference resolution tasks. I will gather details about these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will look for are:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**:
   > Nisan Stiennon, Long Ouyang, Jeff Wu, et al. *Learning to summarize with human feedback*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

3. **Bias-in-Bios**:
   > Maria De-Arteaga, Alexey Romanov, Hanna Wallach, et al. *Bias in bios: A case study of semantic representation bias in a high-stakes setting*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, 2019.

4. **WinoBias**:
   > Jieyu Zhao, Tianlu Wang, Mark Yatskar, et al. *Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 15–20, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information about each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This structured approach will help in effectively summarizing the datasets used in the research paper.
