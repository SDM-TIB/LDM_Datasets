To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Disentanglement for Clustering" by Fei Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several benchmark datasets, specifically **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100-20**, **STL10**, and **ImageNet**. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will then check the **experiments section** for any additional details about how these datasets were used, including any specific splits or configurations mentioned. The authors state that they follow the experimental settings in SCAN for CIFAR datasets and use the full ImageNet dataset for evaluation. This information is important for accurately describing the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **CIFAR10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

3. **STL10**:
   > A. Coates, A. Ng, H. Lee. "An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning." In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2011.

4. **ImageNet**:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
