To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection for River Network Systems" by Katie Buchhorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "benchmarking simulation experiments" and "real-world river network data," which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the challenges of anomaly detection in river networks and the need for reliable data, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of the GDN model and its evaluation. The authors describe the generation of new benchmark data with "highly-sophisticated spatio-temporal structures," which indicates that they created synthetic datasets for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets used in their case studies. The datasets listed are:

1. **SimEuc**: A synthetic dataset generated with Euclidean distance characteristics, containing 3,000 training instances and 1,000 testing instances, with 13.2% anomalies.
2. **SimRiver**: A synthetic dataset generated with river network dynamics, also containing 3,000 training instances and 1,000 testing instances, with 13.2% anomalies.
3. **Herbert**: A real-world dataset from the Herbert river system, containing 12,745 training instances and 3,499 testing instances, with 58.0% anomalies.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the synthetic datasets since they were generated by the authors, but I will note that the Herbert dataset is likely derived from publicly available data sources related to the Herbert river.

For the **Herbert dataset**, I will provide a citation based on the context given in the paper, which mentions that the data were provided by the Department of Environment and Science, Queensland. However, since no specific publication is cited, I will note it as a government dataset.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the Herbert dataset and a note for the synthetic datasets.

1. **SimEuc**: Synthetic dataset generated for benchmarking purposes.
2. **SimRiver**: Synthetic dataset generated for benchmarking purposes.
3. **Herbert Dataset**: 
   > Department of Environment and Science, Queensland. *Water Level Data from the Herbert River System*. Available from: [insert URL if available].

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
