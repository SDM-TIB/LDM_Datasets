To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Multimodal Volumetric Features for Large-Scale Neuron Tracing" by Qihua Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset called **FlyTracing**, which contains millions of pairwise connections of segments from the fly brain. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **introduction** and **dataset construction** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges of neuron reconstruction and the need for large datasets. They specifically highlight that **FlyTracing** is three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets for neuron segment connection, which emphasizes its significance.

In the **dataset construction section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of **FlyTracing**. They describe it as containing millions of connecting segment pairs across the entire fly brain, sourced from a complete adult Drosophila brain imaged at high resolution. They also mention that the dataset is constructed from the proofreading results of the FlyWire project, which is crucial for understanding its context.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **FlyTracing** dataset. The authors reference the original source of the EM images used for this dataset, which is the **full adult fly brain (FAFB)** dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

- Zheng, Z., Lauritzen, J. S., Perlman, E., Robinson, C. G., Nichols, M., Milkie, D., Torrens, O., Price, J., Fisher, C. B., Sharifi, N., et al. (2018). A complete electron microscopy volume of the brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster. *Cell*, 174(3), 730â€“743.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for **FlyTracing**. 

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for **FlyTracing** and ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
