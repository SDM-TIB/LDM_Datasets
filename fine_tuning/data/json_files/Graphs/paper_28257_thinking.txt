To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUINT: Node embedding using network hashing" by Debajyoti Bera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on various datasets for link prediction and node classification, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **Section 6 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for both link prediction and node classification. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the authors list several datasets used for link prediction, including:

1. **Gowalla**: A location-based social networking dataset with 196,591 nodes and 950,327 edges.
2. **Enron Emails Network**: A dataset of email communications with 36,692 nodes and 183,831 edges.
3. **Facebook**: A social network dataset with 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social blog directory dataset with 10,312 nodes and 333,983 edges.
5. **Flickr**: A photo-sharing social network dataset with 80,513 nodes and 5,899,882 edges.
6. **Youtube**: A video-based social network dataset with 1,138,499 nodes and 2,990,443 edges.

I will also check **Table 4**, which lists datasets used for node classification, confirming that some datasets overlap with those used for link prediction.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors may reference the original sources of these datasets, which is crucial for proper citation.

For example, the citation for the **Gowalla dataset** might be:
> Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU. Retrieved from http://www.blogcatalog.com/

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets referenced in the paper.
