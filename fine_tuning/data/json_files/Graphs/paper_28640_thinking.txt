To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Low-light Image Enhancement" by Shijie Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on several public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **LOL dataset** for training, which is a key dataset for low-light image enhancement. They also refer to synthetic low/normal-light images from another source, which may also be relevant.

In the **implementation details** section, the authors provide more information about the LOL dataset, stating that it includes 500 low/normal-light natural image pairs. They specify how these pairs are divided into training, validation, and testing sets, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LOL dataset. The citation for the LOL dataset is:
> Guo, C., Li, C., Guo, J., Loy, C. C., Hou, J., Kwong, S., & Cong, R. (2020). Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation for Low-Light Image Enhancement. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1777â€“1786. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00185

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using parts of synthetic low/normal-light images from another source, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset in the text. Therefore, I will focus on the LOL dataset as the primary dataset extracted from this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LOL dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing in any downstream applications or analyses.
