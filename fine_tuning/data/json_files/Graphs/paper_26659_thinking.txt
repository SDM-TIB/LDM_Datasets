To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating and Mitigating Degree-Related Biases in Graph Convolutional Networks" by Xianfeng Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data Analysis)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they conducted preliminary analysis on four widely used datasets from GCN literature: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Reddit**. This section will provide insights into the characteristics of these datasets.

In **subsection 4.1 (Degree Distribution)**, the authors confirm that they are analyzing the degree distributions of these datasets, which reinforces that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly state that they adopt the same benchmark datasets used by previous works, which include **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed the ones utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

- **Citeseer Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

- **Reddit Dataset**: 
  > Zhang, Y., & Chen, Y. (2018). A survey on community detection with deep learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.06699.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
