To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multifidelity Approach to Continual Learning for Physical Systems" by Amanda Howard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method shows robust results across several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss applications of their method in various contexts, including physics-informed problems and data-informed problems. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in these contexts.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Vanadium Redox-Flow Battery (VRFB) Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a 2-D analytical model that captures the physics of the VRFB system. The authors reference two papers for further details on the model used to generate this dataset.

2. **City-Scale Daily Energy Consumption Dataset**: This dataset includes daily energy usage for three metropolitan areas (New York, Sacramento, and Los Angeles) along with daily weather data. The authors cite a specific paper that provides details about this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **VRFB Dataset**, the citations are:
  > Yunxiang Chen, Jie Bao, Zhijie Xu, Peiyuan Gao, Litao Yan, Soowhan Kim, and Wei Wang. *A two-dimensional analytical unit cell model for redox flow battery evaluation and optimization*. Journal of Power Sources, 506:230192, 2021.
  
  > Yunxiang Chen, Zhijie Xu, Chao Wang, Jie Bao, Brian Koeppel, Litao Yan, Peiyuan Gao, and Wei Wang. *Analytical modeling for redox flow battery design*. Journal of Power Sources, 482:228817, 2021.

- For the **City-Scale Daily Energy Consumption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhe Wang, Tianzhen Hong, Han Li, and Mary Ann Piette. *Predicting city-scale daily electricity consumption using data-driven models*. Advances in Applied Energy, 2:100025, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or references.
