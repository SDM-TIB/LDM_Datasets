To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Presentations are not always linear! GNN meets LLM for Document-to-Presentation Transformation with Attribution" by Himanshu Maheshwari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel graph-based solution and thorough experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they refer to the **SciDuet dataset**, which consists of document-presentation pairs from research papers. This dataset is crucial for training their classifier and evaluating their proposed method.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SciDuet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Sun, E., Hou, Y., Wang, D., Zhang, Y., & Wang, N. X. R. (2021). D2S: Document-to-slide generation via query-based text summarization. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1405â€“1418, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of training or evaluation. However, the primary dataset referenced is the SciDuet dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on section 4.1 for explicit dataset details.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.
4. Document the dataset information clearly and accurately.

This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant dataset information from the paper effectively.
