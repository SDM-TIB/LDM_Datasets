To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability and Multigroup Fairness in Ranking with Uncertain Predictions" by Siddartha Devic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets such as:

1. **ACS Dataset**: The authors mention using the US census data set ACS curated by Ding et al. (2021). I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the specific parameters used for filtering.

2. **Enrollment Dataset**: The paper also discusses the student dropout task Enrollment introduced by Martins et al. (2021). I will extract relevant details about this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will look for are:

- For the **ACS Dataset**:
  > Ding, F., Hardt, M., Miller, J., & Schmidt, L. (2021). Retiring adult: New datasets for fair machine learning. In Proceedings of the 35th Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- For the **Enrollment Dataset**:
  > Martins, M. V., Tolledo, D., Machado, J., Baptista, L. M., & Realinho, V. (2021). Early prediction of studentâ€™s performance in higher education: A case study. In Trends and Applications in Information Systems and Technologies: Volume 1 9.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
