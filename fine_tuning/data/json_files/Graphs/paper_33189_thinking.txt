To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-LIFE: Query-aware Language Image Fusion Embedding for E-Commerce Relevance" by Hai Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Baselines and Datasets)**, the authors mention three training datasets:

1. **Product Title-Image Pairs**: This dataset consists of 5 million product title-image pairs used for training the model.
   
2. **Query-Title-Image Positive Pairs**: This dataset includes 1.3 million <query, title, image> positive pairs sampled from the online clicking log of Miravia Search.

3. **Labeled Query-Title-Image Data**: This dataset contains 200,000 <query, title, image> labeled data, with 30,000 samples selected as the evaluation set, maintaining a 1:1 ratio of positive to negative samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that may have introduced these datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own work or internal data sources, and specific citations for these datasets may not be provided.

Since the datasets are not attributed to external sources, I will note that the first dataset is a large-scale internal dataset, while the second and third datasets are derived from user interaction logs on the Miravia platform.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and any necessary citations, even if they are not traditional references. The focus will be on clearly stating the nature of each dataset and its significance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
