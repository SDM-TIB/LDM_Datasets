To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Embedding for Recommendation against Attribute Inference Attacks" by Hongzhi Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors mention using the **ML-100K dataset** for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that they utilized the **ML-100K dataset**, which contains 10,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies collected from the MovieLens website. This section also provides details about the features extracted from the dataset, such as user ratings, gender, age, and occupation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ML-100K dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> MovieLens. 2019. *MovieLens Dataset*. http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens.

Since the dataset is publicly available, the citation includes the title and the URL where it can be accessed.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise representation of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
