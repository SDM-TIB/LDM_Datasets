To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Representations and Explicit Memory: Learning Effective Navigation Policies on 3D Scene Graph using Graph Neural Networks" by Z. Ravichandran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of high-level hierarchical representations for navigation, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors mention using a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator for their experiments. This indicates that they may have used synthetic datasets generated from this simulator, but I need to verify if they reference any specific datasets or benchmarks.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets to ensure proper attribution.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the details of each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for each entry.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
