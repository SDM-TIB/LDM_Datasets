To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyper-GST: Predict Metro Passenger Flow Incorporating GraphSAGE, Hypergraph, Social-meaningful Edge Weights and Temporal Exploitation" by Yuyang Miao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on metro passenger flow prediction, which suggests that relevant datasets may be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their study. They state that the dataset is sourced from the **VIS-tube project** and contains traffic data, geometrical data, and social data. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including its structure and the types of data it encompasses.

The authors describe the traffic data as containing entry and exit data for each station at five time stamps (Early, AM, Mid, PM, Late) over a span of 13 years (2003-2012 and 2014-2016) for 206 stations within Zone 4. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VIS-tube project dataset. The citation is as follows:
> VIS-tube project. Available at: https://github.com/oobrien/vis (accessed: 2022-02-08).

Since the dataset is derived from a project rather than a traditional publication, the citation format reflects that.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further exploration of the dataset by other researchers.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the structured output format, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
