To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Robust Motion Segmentation with Non-Static Cameras" by Markus Bosch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used. The introduction often outlines the motivation and contributions of the work, which can also include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **subsection 4.2 (CDNet2014)**, the paper describes the CDNet2014 dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for background subtraction and motion segmentation. It mentions that this dataset consists of various categories and provides a comprehensive overview of its structure and the number of annotated frames.

In **subsection 4.3 (LASIESTA)**, the paper discusses the LASIESTA dataset, which is also used for motion segmentation. This section will provide details about the number of frames, categories, and the nature of the annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:
- For **CDNet2014**, I will find the citation provided in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.
- For **LASIESTA**, I will similarly locate its citation in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
