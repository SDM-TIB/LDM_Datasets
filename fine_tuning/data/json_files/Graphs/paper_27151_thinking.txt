To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Feature Suppression in Unsupervised Visual Representations" by Tianhong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors state that they evaluated their method on four different datasets: **ImageNet, MPII, Colorful-Moving-MNIST, and FairFace**. I will note down these datasets and look for descriptions or characteristics provided in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide brief descriptions of each dataset:

1. **ImageNet**: A widely used image classification benchmark containing 1.28 million images across 1000 categories. This dataset is crucial for evaluating self-supervised learning methods.

2. **MPII**: A dataset commonly used for human pose estimation, containing images of everyday human activities. This dataset is significant for tasks related to pose estimation.

3. **FairFace**: A face attribute classification dataset where each image contains multiple attributes such as gender, age, and ethnicity. This dataset is important for multi-attribute classification tasks.

4. **Colorful-Moving-MNIST**: A synthetic dataset designed to illustrate the feature suppression problem. It consists of digits from the MNIST dataset overlaid on randomly selected background images from the STL-10 dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **MPII**, the citation is:
  > Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Peter Gehler, and Bernt Schiele. *2D human pose estimation: New benchmark and state of the art analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3686–3693, 2014.

- For **FairFace**, the citation is:
  > Kimmo Kärkkäinen and Jungseock Joo. *FairFace: Face attribute dataset for balanced race, gender, and age*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.04913, 2019.

- For **Colorful-Moving-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yonglong Tian, Chen Sun, Ben Poole, Dilip Krishnan, Cordelia Schmid, and Phillip Isola. *What makes for good views for contrastive learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.10243, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
