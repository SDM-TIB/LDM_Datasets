To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Unsupervised Hashing with Contrastive Information Bottleneck" by Zexuan Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method significantly outperforms existing baselines." This indicates that datasets are indeed used, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images from 10 classes. The authors specify that they randomly select 1,000 images per class as the query set and 500 images per class as the training set.

2. **NUS-WIDE**: This is a multi-label dataset containing 269,648 images from 81 categories. The authors use a subset with images from the 21 most frequent categories, selecting 100 images per class as the query set and using the remaining images as the database.

3. **MSCOCO**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing a subset of 122,218 images from 80 categories. The authors randomly select 5,000 images from this subset as the query set.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Handbook of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases*, 1(4).

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:
  > Chua, T.-S., Tang, J., Hong, R., Li, H., Luo, Z., & Zheng, Y. (2009). NUS-WIDE: A real-world web image database from national university of singapore. In *CIVR*.

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *European conference on computer vision*.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries in a structured format for further use or analysis.
