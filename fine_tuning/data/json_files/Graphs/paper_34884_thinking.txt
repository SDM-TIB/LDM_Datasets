To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Learning via Cluster Distance Prediction for Operating Room Context Awareness" by Idris Hamoud et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets containing multi-view data captured from clinical scenarios, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Operating Room Awareness Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Semantic Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,980 densely annotated depth images captured by four different ToF cameras placed on the da Vinci robot. The data was collected in a clinical development lab simulating robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures, with eight different objects annotated.

2. **Activity Classification Dataset**: This dataset includes videos recorded from a single medical facility with two robotic ORs and da Vinci Xi systems. It consists of 400 videos, totaling around two hours, annotated with ten clinically relevant OR activities. A subset of this dataset contains 34 cases with 28 robot-assisted and 6 non-robot-assisted procedures, resulting in 98,929 images sampled at 1 frame per second.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Semantic Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Z., Shaban, A., Simard, J.G., Rabindran, D., DiMaio, S.P., Mohareri, O. *A robotic 3D perception system for operating room environment awareness*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (IPCAI), 2020.

- For the **Activity Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aidean, S., Helene, H., Daniel, O., Omid, M. *Automatic operating room surgical activity recognition for robot-assisted surgery*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
