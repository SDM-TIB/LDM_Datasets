To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medication Recommendation via Dual Molecular Modalities and Multi-Substructure Enhancement" by Shi Mu, Shunpan Liang, and Xiang Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MIMIC-III** and **MIMIC-IV** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of patients, clinical events, diseases, procedures, and medications. This information confirms the datasets' relevance and provides context for their use in the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention:
- **MIMIC-III**: Contains clinical records, physiological measurements, laboratory monitoring data, and medication records of ICU patients. The statistics provided are:
  - # patients: 6,350
  - # clinical events: 15,032
  - # diseases: 1,958
  - # procedures: 1,430
  - # medications: 131
  - avg. # of visits: 2.37
  - avg. # of medications: 11.44

- **MIMIC-IV**: Similar to MIMIC-III but with updated data. The statistics are:
  - # patients: 60,125
  - # clinical events: 156,810
  - # diseases: 2,000
  - # procedures: 1,500
  - # medications: 131
  - avg. # of visits: 2.61
  - avg. # of medications: 6.66

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.W.H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L.A., Mark, R.G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 1-9.

- For **MIMIC-IV**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Bulgarelli, L., Shen, L., Gayles, A., Shammout, A., Horng, S., Pollard, T.J., Hao, S., Moody, B., Gow, B., et al. (2023). MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset. *Scientific Data*, 10, 1.

With this information gathered, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I include all relevant details for each dataset as required.
