To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Instance Learning via Iterative Self-Paced Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Kangning Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on three medical datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

The three datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Camelyon16**: This dataset is used for detecting breast cancer metastasis in lymph node sections. It consists of 400 whole-slide images, each corresponding to a bag with a binary label indicating the presence of cancer. The dataset also includes pixel-wise annotations for deriving ground-truth instance-level labels.

2. **TCGA-LUAD**: This dataset is sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas and is used to detect genetic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. It contains 800 labeled tumorous frozen whole-slide images, with each image divided into tiles corresponding to unlabeled instances.

3. **Breast Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset includes 28,914 B-mode breast ultrasound exams, with the task of detecting breast cancer. Each exam has a bag-level label indicating the presence of cancer, and a subset of images is annotated for evaluating instance-level performance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- For **Camelyon16**:
  > Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi et al. "Diagnostic assessment of deep learning algorithms for detection of lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer." *JAMA*, 318(22):2199–2210, 2017.

- For **TCGA-LUAD**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas. "The cancer genome atlas program." Available at: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga, 2019.

- For **Breast Ultrasound Dataset**:
  > Yiqiu Shen et al. "Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams." *Nature Communications*, 12(1):1–13, 2021.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
