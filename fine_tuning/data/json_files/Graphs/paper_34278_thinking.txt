To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction" by Junrui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical evaluations using **two large-scale naturalistic datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **nuScenes**: This dataset is described as a large-scale autonomous driving dataset containing 1000 scenes, which are split into training-validation and testing sets. The authors used the preprocessed Trajectron++ nuScenes dataset for their evaluations.

2. **ETH-UCY**: This dataset consists of pedestrian datasets with five subsets (ETH, Hotel, Univ, Zara1, and Zara2), which contain recordings of pedestrians interacting in various scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **ETH-UCY**, the citation is:
  > S. Pellegrini, A. Ess, K. Schindler, and L. van Gool. *Youâ€™ll never walk alone: Modeling social behavior for multi-target tracking*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **nuScenes**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving that includes 1000 scenes, used for trajectory prediction tasks.
2. **ETH-UCY**: A collection of pedestrian datasets that includes various scenarios for tracking and predicting pedestrian behavior.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
