To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Adversarial Objectives for Self-Supervised Representation Learning" by Xiao Zhang and Michael Maire, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings** sections of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and an ImageNet subset**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **appendix** section, specifically **Appendix A.1**, where the authors provide details about the datasets. Here, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **ImageNet-10**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, consisting of 10 categories selected from the original dataset, resulting in 13,000 training images and 500 validation images. This dataset is widely used for evaluating image classification models.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
