To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Navigational Information to Learn Visual Representations" by Lizhen Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research, but I will focus on sections that are more likely to contain specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of learning visual representations and the limitations of existing datasets. However, they do not mention specific datasets here, so I will move on to the next section.

In **section 2 (Egocentric-vision image generation)**, the authors describe the generation of their dataset using the ThreeDWorld platform. They mention that they generate images from a controlled environment, but they do not provide a specific dataset name yet.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment and results)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. They state that they collected a dataset consisting of **14,767 high-quality images** from a continuous trajectory through a house in the ThreeDWorld environment. This is a critical piece of information, as it indicates the dataset they created for their experiments.

Now, I need to find the full citation for the ThreeDWorld platform, as it is the source of the dataset. In the **References section**, I find the citation for ThreeDWorld:

- For **ThreeDWorld**, the citation is:
  > Chuang Gan, Jeremy Schwartz, Seth Alter, Martin Schrimpf, James Traer, Julian De Freitas, Jonas Kubilius, Abhishek Bhandwaldar, Nick Haber, Megumi Sano, et al. *ThreeDWorld: A platform for interactive multi-modal physical simulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.04954 (2020).

Since the dataset is generated from the ThreeDWorld platform, I will use this citation to reference the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. The dataset I will document is:

1. **ThreeDWorld Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 14,767 high-quality images generated from a continuous trajectory through a house environment, recorded with navigational information.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
