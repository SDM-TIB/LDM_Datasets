To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework Using Contrastive Learning for Classification with Noisy Labels" by Madalina Ciortan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experiments were performed on "standard benchmarks and real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and 10 classes.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset also has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it contains 100 classes, with the same resolution of 32x32 pixels.

3. **Webvision**: This is a real-world dataset containing 2.4 million images crawled from the web, sharing the same 1,000 classes as the ImageNet dataset. The authors mention using a subset called "mini Webvision," which consists of 66,000 images from the top 50 classes.

4. **Clothing1M**: This dataset consists of 1 million images of clothing articles across 14 classes, gathered from e-commerce websites. The authors used a subset of 56,000 images for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **Webvision**, the citation is:
  > Wen Li, Limin Wang, Wei Li, Eirikur Agustsson, and Luc Van Gool. *Webvision Database: Visual Learning and Understanding from Web Data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02862, 2017.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2691â€“2699, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
