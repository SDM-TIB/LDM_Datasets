To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Retention-oriented Recommendation with Decision Transformer" by Lixin Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of user retention and mentions the use of datasets for evaluating their proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically section 3.1, which is dedicated to datasets. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **IQiYi Dataset**: This dataset records approximately 70 million user interactions for 4 million videos, including views and comments. The authors note that they selected users with at least 20 interaction records for their experiments.

2. **ML-1m Dataset**: This is a commonly used benchmark dataset that contains ratings from 6,014 users for 3,417 movies. The authors mention that user retention is calculated from this dataset on a monthly basis.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IQiYi Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IQiYi User Retention Data. Available at: http://challenge.ai.iqiyi.com/

- For the **ML-1m Dataset**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
