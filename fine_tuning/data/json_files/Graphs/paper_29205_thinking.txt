To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inspection-L: Self-Supervised GNN Node Embeddings for Money Laundering Detection in Bitcoin" by Wai Weng Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on the **Elliptic dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, describing it as a realistic, partially labeled Bitcoin temporal graph-based transaction dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention the **Elliptic dataset** in the context of their experiments, confirming its use for evaluating their proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Elliptic dataset**, including its composition: it consists of 203,769 node transactions and 234,355 directed transaction payment flows, with 49 different timestep graphs. This detailed description is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Elliptic dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Mark Weber, G. Domeniconi, J. Chen, D. K. I. Weidele, C. Bellei, T. Robinson, C. E. Leiserson. *Anti-money laundering in bitcoin: Experimenting with graph convolutional networks for financial forensics*. In ACM SIGKDD International Workshop on Knowledge discovery and data mining, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Elliptic dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Elliptic dataset** and ensure that it is ready for any further processing or review.
