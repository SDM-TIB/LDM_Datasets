To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Video-Language Segmentation" by Chen Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Criteria)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **A2D Sentences**: This dataset contains 3,782 videos with pixel-level actor-action segmentation masks and corresponding natural language descriptions. The authors mention that it was originally introduced in a previous work and extended with sentences.

2. **J-HMDB Sentences**: This dataset consists of 928 short videos, each paired with a sentence describing the action. It includes pixel-wise 2D articulated human puppet masks for evaluating segmentation performance.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **A2D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, B., Wang, N., Chen, T., and Li, M. (2015). *Can humans fly? Action understanding with multiple classes of actors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8.

- For **J-HMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jhuang, H., Gall, J., Zuffi, S., Schmid, C., and Black, M. J. (2013). *Towards understanding action recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192-3199.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
