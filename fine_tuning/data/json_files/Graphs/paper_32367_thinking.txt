To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards multi-modal anatomical landmark detection for ultrasound-guided brain tumor resection with contrastive learning" by Soorena Salari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed and validated their technique using the **public RESECT database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Data and landmark annotation)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They mention the **EASY-RESECT (REtroSpective Evaluation of Cerebral Tumors) dataset**, which is a deep-learning-ready version of the original RESECT database. This section outlines that the dataset contains MRI and intra-operative ultrasound scans of 22 subjects who underwent low-grade glioma resection surgeries, with matching anatomical landmarks manually labeled by experts.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RESECT dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Y. Xiao, M. Fortin, G. Unsgård, H. Rivaz, and I. Reinertsen. *Retrospective evaluation of cerebral tumors (RESECT): A clinical database of pre-operative MRI and intra-operative ultrasound in low-grade glioma surgeries*. Medical Physics, vol. 44, no. 7, pp. 3875–3882, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **EASY-RESECT Dataset**: This dataset is a modified version of the original RESECT database, containing MRI and intra-operative ultrasound scans of 22 subjects. It includes manually labeled anatomical landmarks, which are crucial for the study's focus on landmark detection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the EASY-RESECT dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details for future reference or processing.
