To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ACTION++: Improving Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Adaptive Anatomical Contrast" by Chenyu You et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **ACDC and LA benchmarks**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200 cardiac cine MRI scans from 100 patients, with three segmentation classes: left ventricle (LV), myocardium (Myo), and right ventricle (RV). The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **LA Dataset**: This dataset includes 100 gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans, with a fixed split of 80 scans for training and 20 for validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ACDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Ballester, M.A.G., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 2018.

- For the **LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiong, Z., Xia, Q., Hu, Z., Huang, N., Bian, C., Zheng, Y., Vesal, S., Ravikumar, N., Maier, A., Yang, X., et al. "A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging." *Medical Image Analysis*, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
