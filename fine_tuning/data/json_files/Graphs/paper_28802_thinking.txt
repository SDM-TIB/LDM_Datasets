To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Intention Adaptive Graph Neural Network for Category-aware Session-based Recommendation" by Chuan Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets: **Diginetica**, **Yoochoose**, and **Jdata**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific information provided.

1. **Diginetica**: This dataset includes user sessions extracted from e-commerce search logs, with desensitized user IDs, hashed queries, hashed query terms, hashed product descriptions, log-scaled prices, clicks, and purchases.

2. **Yoochoose**: This dataset is from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains user clicks and purchases from an online retailer over several months. The authors mention that they used a fraction (1/4) of the Yoochoose data for their experiments.

3. **Jdata**: This dataset is from a challenge hosted by JD.com and consists of session data filtered by a one-hour duration.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > Diginetica Dataset. *https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161*.

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > Yoochoose Dataset. *https://www.kaggle.com/chadgostopp/recsys-challenge-2015*.

- For **Jdata**, the citation is:
  > Jdata Dataset. *https://jdata.jd.com/html/detail.html?id=8*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
