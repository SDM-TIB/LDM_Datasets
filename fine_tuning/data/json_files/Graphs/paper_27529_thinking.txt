To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentional Graph Neural Network for Parking-slot Detection" by Chen Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a public benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimental Results and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they evaluated their method on the **ps2.0 dataset**. They provide details about this dataset, including the number of training and testing images, the number of parking slots, and the conditions under which the images were collected.

The authors also mention using the **PSV dataset** as an out-of-distribution testing dataset. This is important as it indicates that they are validating their model's performance on a different dataset, which is crucial for assessing generalization.

Now, I will gather the specific details for each dataset:

1. **ps2.0 Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 9827 training images with 9476 parking slots and 2338 testing images with 2168 parking slots. The dataset is collected from various indoor and outdoor scenes under different environmental conditions.

2. **PSV Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for testing the generalization performance of the proposed method. The authors do not provide extensive details about this dataset in the paper, but they cite a reference for it.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ps2.0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Heimberger, J. Horgan, C. Hughes, J. McDonald, and S. Yogamani. *Computer vision in automated parking systems: Design, implementation and challenges*. Image and Vision Computing, vol. 68, no. dec., pp. 88–101, 2017.

- For the **PSV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Wu, T. Yang, J. Zhao, L. Guan, and W. Jiang. *VH-HFCN based parking slot and lane markings segmentation on panoramic surround view*. In IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2018, pp. 1767–1772.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
