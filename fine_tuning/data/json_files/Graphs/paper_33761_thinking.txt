To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Automated Passenger Counting Data Denoising" by No√©lie Cherrier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **APC data** and the evaluation of the proposed denoising algorithm on several public transportation networks in France. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using data from **four public transportation networks in France**: Angers, Nevers, Brest, and an anonymized Network A. This suggests that these networks are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as the number of records, types of data collected (e.g., boarding and alighting counts), and any other relevant characteristics. The paper states that **74 records** are available for Network A, which includes the number of boarding and alighting passengers as well as occupancy onboard the vehicle.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets from the public transportation networks, as they are likely proprietary or unpublished data. However, I will note that the authors acknowledge the networks (Irigo, Taneo, and Bibus) for allowing the publication of results.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant citations. Since the datasets are based on real-world data from specific networks, I will format the entries accordingly, even if the citations are not traditional academic references.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any downstream processing or review.
