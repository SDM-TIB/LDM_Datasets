To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Residual or Gate? Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks for Inductive Graph Representation Learning" by Binxuan Huang and Kathleen M. Carley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **Pubmed**, **Reddit**, and **PPI**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in Table II, which includes the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes for each dataset. Here are the details I will extract:

1. **Pubmed**: This dataset consists of academic papers represented as nodes, with citations as edges. It has 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, and 3 classes.

2. **Reddit**: This dataset contains 232,965 Reddit posts as nodes, with edges representing user interactions. It has 232,965 nodes, 11,606,919 edges, 602 features, and 41 classes.

3. **PPI**: This dataset includes 24 protein-protein interaction graphs, with each graph corresponding to a different human tissue. It has 56,944 nodes, 818,716 edges, 50 features, and 121 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Reddit**, the citation is:
  > Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 1024-1034).

- For **PPI**, the citation is:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks*. Bioinformatics, 33(14), i190-i198.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
