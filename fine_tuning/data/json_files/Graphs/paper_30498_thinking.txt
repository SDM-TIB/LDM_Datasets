To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tucker-O-Minus Decomposition for Multi-view Tensor Subspace Clustering" by Yingcong Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Numerical experiments on six benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method," indicating that multiple datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention six datasets: **Yale**, **MSRCV1**, **ExtendYaleB**, **ORL**, **Reuters**, and **Handwritten**. I will take note of the specific characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of samples, views, and features.

I will also check the **statistics table** (Table 3) provided in the experiments section, which summarizes the datasets' details, including the number of features, samples, views, and clusters. This will help me gather comprehensive information about each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Yale Dataset**:
   > Yale Face Database. Available at: http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html

2. **MSRCV1 Dataset**:
   > Microsoft Research Cambridge Object Recognition Image Database. Available at: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/objectclassrecognition/

3. **ExtendYaleB Dataset**:
   > Extend Yale Face Database B. Available at: http://www.uk.research.att.com/facedatabase.html

4. **ORL Dataset**:
   > ORL Face Database. Available at: http://lig-membres.imag.fr/grimal/data.html

5. **Reuters Dataset**:
   > Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection. Available at: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220724942

6. **Handwritten Dataset**:
   > Handwritten Digit Recognition Dataset. Available at: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/datasets/

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.
