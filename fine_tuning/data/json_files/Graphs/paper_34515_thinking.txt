To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cardinality Estimation on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs" by Fei Teng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that there is only one existing dataset for hyper-relational query cardinality estimation, namely **WD50K-QE**, which is a good starting point. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the research. The **section 3 (Hyper-relational Queryset construction)** provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets created for the study. Here, the authors mention that they constructed three diverse and unbiased hyper-relational query sets over three popular hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs): **WD50K**, **JF17K**, and **wikipeople**. 

In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **WD50K**: This dataset is mentioned as a newly generated dataset for hyper-relational queries.
2. **JF17K**: Another dataset created for the same purpose.
3. **wikipeople**: The third dataset that was generated.

The authors also mention that these datasets cover various query patterns and cardinality ranges, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WD50K**, the citation is:
  > Dimitrios Alivanistos, Max Berrendorf, Michael Cochez, and Mikhail Galkin. *Query Embedding on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs*. CoRR abs/2106.08166 (2021). arXiv:2106.08166. https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08166

- For **JF17K**, the citation is:
  > Jianfeng Wen, Jianxin Li, Yongyi Mao, Shini Chen, and Richong Zhang. *On the representation and embedding of knowledge bases beyond binary relations*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI’16), 1300–1307, 2016.

- For **wikipeople**, the citation is:
  > Saiping Guan, Xiaolong Jin, Yuanzhuo Wang, and Xueqi Cheng. *Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Data*. In The World Wide Web Conference (WWW ’19), 583–593, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
