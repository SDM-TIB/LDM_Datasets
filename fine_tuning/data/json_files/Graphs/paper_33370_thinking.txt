To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CETN: Contrast-enhanced Through Network for CTR Prediction" by Honghao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "four real datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for the research. I will look for the names of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors typically provide information about the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

In the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention four datasets:
1. **Avazu**: Contains 40 million instances with 24 fields and 8.37 million features.
2. **Criteo**: Contains 46 million instances with 39 fields and 5.55 million features.
3. **MovieLens**: Contains 2,006,859 instances with 3 fields and 90,445 features.
4. **Frappe**: Contains 288,609 instances with 10 fields and 5,382 features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide specific citations for the datasets since they are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field. However, I will note any relevant references that describe these datasets.

For the datasets, I will use the following citations based on common knowledge in the field:
- **Avazu**: 
  > Avazu. *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.
  
- **Criteo**: 
  > Criteo. *Criteo Display Advertising Challenge Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge.
  
- **MovieLens**: 
  > GroupLens. *MovieLens Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.
  
- **Frappe**: 
  > Baltrunas, L. *Frappe Dataset*. Available at: http://baltrunas.info/research-menu/frappe.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
