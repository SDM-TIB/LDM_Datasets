To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localisation of Mammographic masses by Greedy Backtracking of Activations in the Stacked Auto-Encoders" by Shamna Pootheri and V K Govindan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using "randomly selected 200 mammographic images (100 normal and 100 abnormal) from IRMA mammographic dataset." This suggests that the IRMA dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **experimental details section**. Here, the authors confirm that they used the IRMA mammographic dataset, specifying that it consists of 200 images, with 100 normal and 100 abnormal mammograms. They also mention that the abnormal mass regions were marked by an expert radiologist, which serves as the ground truth for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IRMA dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **IRMA mammographic dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Heath, K. Bowyer, D. Kopans, R. Moore, W. P. Kegelmeyer. *The digital database for screening mammography*. In Proceedings of the 5th international workshop on digital mammography, Medical Physics Publishing, 2000, pp. 212â€“218.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the IRMA mammographic dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
