To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unique Training Strategy to Enhance Language Models Capabilities for Health Mention Detection from Social Media Content" by Pervaiz Iqbal Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across **3 public benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **HMC-2019**: This dataset contains 15,742 samples and is associated with 10 diseases and 2 classes.
2. **RHMD**: This dataset has 10,015 samples, 15 diseases, and 3 classes.
3. **COVID-19 PHM**: This dataset includes 9,219 samples, 1 disease, and 2 classes.

The authors also provide preprocessing details for these datasets, which confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **HMC-2019**, the citation is:
  > Biddle, R., Joshi, A., Liu, S., Paris, C., Xu, G. (2020). Leveraging sentiment distributions to distinguish figurative from literal health reports on twitter. In Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020. pp. 1217–1227.

- For **RHMD**, the citation is:
  > Naseem, U., Kim, J., Khushi, M., Dunn, A.G. (2022). Identification of disease or symptom terms in reddit to improve health mention classification. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022. pp. 2573–2581.

- For **COVID-19 PHM**, the citation is:
  > Luo, L., Wang, Y., Liu, H. (2022). Covid-19 personal health mention detection from tweets using dual convolutional neural network. Expert Systems with Applications, 200, 117139.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
