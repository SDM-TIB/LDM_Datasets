To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qontsum: On Contrasting Salient Content for Query-focused Summarization" by Sajad Sotudeh and Nazli Goharian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on benchmark datasets for query-focused summarization, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **QMSum**: This dataset consists of 1,808 query-focused summaries extracted from 232 multi-turn meetings across various domains. It includes annotations such as topic segmentations and highlighted text spans associated with reference summaries. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **SQuALITY**: This dataset comprises 100 stories, 500 questions, and 2000 summaries. Each question is accompanied by four reference summaries written by trained writers. The dataset is also split into training, validation, and testing sets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **QMSum**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, M., Yin, D., Yu, T., Zaidi, A., Mutuma, M., Jha, R., Awadallah, A. H., Celikyilmaz, A., Liu, Y., Qiu, X., & Radev, D. (2021). QMSum: A New Benchmark for Query-based Multi-domain Meeting Summarization. In North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL).

- For **SQuALITY**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
