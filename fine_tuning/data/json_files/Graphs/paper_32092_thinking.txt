To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How does over-squashing affect the power of GNNs?" by Francesco Di Giovanni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **ZINC chemical dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ZINC dataset. The citation for the ZINC dataset is as follows:
> John J. Irwin, Teague Sterling, Michael M. Mysinger, Erin S. Bolstad, and Ryan G. Coleman. *ZINC: A Free Tool to Discover Chemistry for Biology*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(7):1757â€“1768, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details in a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a clear format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
