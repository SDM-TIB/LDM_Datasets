To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PHLP: Sole Persistent Homology for Link Prediction - Interpretable Feature Extraction" by Junwon You, Eunwoo Heo, and Jae-Hun Jung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the application of their method to various domains, hinting at the use of benchmark datasets for evaluation. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they provide a table (Table I) that lists the datasets along with their statistics, which is crucial for identifying the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **USAir**: A dataset with 332 nodes and 2126 edges.
2. **NS**: A dataset with 1589 nodes and 2742 edges.
3. **PB**: A dataset with 1222 nodes and 16714 edges.
4. **Yeast**: A dataset with 2375 nodes and 11693 edges.
5. **C. elegans (C.ele)**: A dataset with 297 nodes and 2148 edges.
6. **Power**: A dataset with 4941 nodes and 6594 edges.
7. **Router**: A dataset with 5022 nodes and 6258 edges.
8. **E. coli**: A dataset with 1805 nodes and 15660 edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided for the datasets used in the experiments, and they may include the original papers or sources where the datasets can be accessed.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
