To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Manifold Learning for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment" by Timin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method demonstrates better performance on **seven standard datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **LIVE**: A synthetic dataset generated by applying various distortions to original images.
2. **CSIQ**: Another synthetic dataset used for image quality assessment.
3. **TID2013**: A well-known dataset for evaluating image quality assessment algorithms.
4. **KADID**: A large-scale artificially distorted IQA database.
5. **LIVEC**: An authentic dataset captured by different photographers.
6. **KonIQ**: An ecologically valid dataset for deep learning of blind image quality assessment.
7. **LIVEFB**: A dataset specifically designed for assessing image quality in smartphone photography.
8. **SPAQ**: Another dataset used for perceptual quality assessment.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations for each one.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
