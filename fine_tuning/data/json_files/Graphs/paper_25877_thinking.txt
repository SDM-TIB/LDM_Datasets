To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Graph Auto-Encoders" by Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is demonstrated using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and that it achieves competitive results on a link prediction task in citation networks. This suggests that datasets related to citation networks are likely used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors discuss their methodology for link prediction tasks. They mention using several popular citation network datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be listed.

In the experiments section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors refer to three datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. Each of these datasets is commonly used in the context of citation networks and is likely to be detailed in the references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: The citation is:
   > P. Sen, G. M. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: The citation is the same as for Cora, as it is often referenced in the same context:
   > P. Sen, G. M. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset is also commonly referenced in the same context, and the citation is:
   > P. Sen, G. M. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

Although the same citation is used for all three datasets, it is important to note that they are distinct datasets used for different experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
