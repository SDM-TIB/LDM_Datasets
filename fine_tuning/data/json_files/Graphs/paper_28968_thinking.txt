To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Compositional Adversarial Robustness: Generalizing Adversarial Training to Composite Semantic Perturbations" by Lei Hsiung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that results were obtained using **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: This is a large-scale dataset used for image classification and object detection, containing over 10 million images across 1,000 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
