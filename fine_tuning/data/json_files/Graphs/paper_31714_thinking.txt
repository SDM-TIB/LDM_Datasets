To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Synthetic Image Refinement via Contrastive Learning and Consistent Semantic-Structural Constraints" by Ganning Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of refining synthetic images and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on the **GTA5 dataset** and the **Synthia dataset**, specifically refining these datasets to the **CityScapes dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of images, the type of data, and any relevant characteristics. The authors mention that they resize images in all datasets to a size of 256 × 256 and use standard training/test splits for GTA5 and CityScapes. For Synthia, they specify using the last 1,880 images for testing and the remaining 7,520 images for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **GTA5 Dataset**:
   - Citation:

2. **Synthia Dataset**:
   - Citation:

3. **CityScapes Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., and Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
