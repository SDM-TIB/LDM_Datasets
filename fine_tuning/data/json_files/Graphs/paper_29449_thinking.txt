To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoSA: A Robust Self-Aligned Framework for Node-Node Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to provide the most detailed information about the datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In subsection 4.1, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **ten public benchmark datasets**. They categorize these datasets into different types: four homophilous datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and DBLP), three non-homophilous datasets (Cornell, Wisconsin, and Texas), two large-scale inductive datasets (Flickr and Reddit), and one dynamic graph dataset (CIAW). This categorization is crucial for understanding the context in which each dataset is used.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented properly for future reference.
