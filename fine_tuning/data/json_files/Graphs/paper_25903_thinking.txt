To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Entities and Relations for Learning and Inference in Knowledge Bases" by Bishan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of embedding models on link prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 4 (Inference Task I: Link Prediction)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention using the **WordNet (WN)** and **Freebase (FB15k)** datasets for their experiments. I will note the details provided about each dataset:

1. **WordNet (WN)**: Contains 151,442 triplets with 40,943 entities and 18 relations.
2. **Freebase (FB15k)**: Consists of 592,213 triplets with 14,951 entities and 1,345 relations. Additionally, a subset called **FB15k-401** is mentioned, which contains 560,209 triplets with 14,541 entities and 401 relations.

To confirm the datasets used, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Miller, George A. "WordNet: A lexical database for English." Communications of the ACM 38.11 (1995): 39-41.

- For **Freebase**, the citation is:
  > Bollacker, Kurt, et al. "Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge." Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. ACM, 2008.

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, Antoine, et al. "Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2013.

- For **FB15k-401**, since it is a subset of FB15k, I will refer to the original FB15k citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper.
