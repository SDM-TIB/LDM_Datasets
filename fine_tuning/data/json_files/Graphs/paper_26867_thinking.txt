To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overcoming Data Sparsity in Group Recommendation" by Hongzhi Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors created **three large-scale benchmark datasets** for evaluating their group recommendation system, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a detailed description of the datasets they created, including statistics about users, groups, items, and interactions.

The paper mentions three datasets:
1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of 34,504 users, 24,103 groups, and 22,611 items (restaurants). The average group size is 4.45, with an average of 1.12 interactions per group and 13.98 interactions per user.
   
2. **Douban-Event Dataset**: This dataset includes 24,631 users, 13,552 groups, and 19,031 items. The average group size is 8.79, with 1.40 interactions per group and 5.15 interactions per user.

3. **Meetup Dataset**: This dataset has 70,743 users, 110,597 groups, and 60,028 items. The average group size is 4.82, with 1.48 interactions per group and 48.38 interactions per user.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are created by the authors themselves, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are derived from publicly available sources like the Yelp Challenge dataset and Douban-Event.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself and any relevant details about the datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Hongzhi Yin, Qinyong Wang, Kai Zheng, Zhixu Li, Xiaofang Zhou. "Overcoming Data Sparsity in Group Recommendation." IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, vol. X, no. X, XXXX 2019.

With this information, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the necessary details such as the number of users, groups, items, and interactions, along with the citation for the paper.
