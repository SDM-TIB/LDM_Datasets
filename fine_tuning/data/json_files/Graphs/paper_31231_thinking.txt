To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DRASCLR: A Self-Supervised Framework of Learning Disease-Related and Anatomy-Specific Representation for 3D Medical Images" by Ke Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on large-scale CT datasets of lung images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **COPDGene Dataset**: This dataset is a multi-center observational study that collects imaging data, genetic biomarkers, and relevant phenotypes from a large cohort of subjects. The authors specify that they used a large set of 3D thorax CT images from 9,180 subjects for self-supervised pre-training and provide details about the annotations related to emphysema.

2. **MosMed Dataset**: This dataset contains 3D thorax CT images of 1,110 subjects from municipal hospitals in Moscow, Russia. The authors mention that subjects in this dataset are classified into five grades based on COVID-19 related CT findings and physiological measures.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COPDGene Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Regan, E. A., Hokanson, J. E., Murphy, J. R., Make, B., Lynch, D. A., Beaty, T. H., & Crapo, J. D. (2011). Genetic epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study design. *COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease*, 7(1), 32-43.

- For the **MosMed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Morozov, S. P., Andreychenko, A. E., Pavlov, N. A., Vladzymyrskyy, A. V., Ledikhova, N. V., Gombolevskiy, V. A., ... & Chernina, V. Yu. (2020). MosMedData: Chest CT scans with COVID-19 related findings dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.06465*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
