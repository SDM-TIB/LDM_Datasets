To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAITGRAPH: GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK FOR SKELETON-BASED GAIT RECOGNITION" by Torben Teepe Ali Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CASIA-B gait dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Training Details)**, they explicitly mention the **CASIA-B gait dataset**. They describe it as a widely used dataset composed of 124 subjects, with multiple views and walking conditions. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and the number of sequences per subject.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CASIA-B dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- For **CASIA-B gait dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shiqi Yu, Daoliang Tan, and Tieniu Tan. “A framework for evaluating the effect of view angle, clothing and carrying condition on gait recognition.” In ICPR. IEEE, 2006, vol. 4, pp. 441–444.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **CASIA-B gait dataset** is the only dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CASIA-B gait dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
