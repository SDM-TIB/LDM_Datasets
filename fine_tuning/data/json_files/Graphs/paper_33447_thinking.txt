To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An FPGA-Based Accelerator for Graph Embedding Using Sequential Training Algorithm" by Kazuki Sunaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the evaluation section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 4 (Evaluations)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used in their evaluations, which are summarized in Table 1. This table provides key details about each dataset, including the number of edges, nodes, and classes.

The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: A paper citation network in the machine learning research field, consisting of 5,429 edges, 2,708 nodes, and 7 classes.
2. **Amazon Photo**: A subset of the Amazon co-purchase graph dataset, containing 143,663 edges, 7,650 nodes, and 8 classes.
3. **Amazon Electronics Computers**: Another subset of the Amazon co-purchase graph dataset, with 287,209 edges, 13,752 nodes, and 10 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Kachites, McCallum Kamal Nigram, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- For **Amazon Photo** and **Amazon Electronics Computers**, both datasets are cited from the same source:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qingfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the International ACM Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), pages 43–52, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
