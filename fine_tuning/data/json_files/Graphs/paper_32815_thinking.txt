To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Prompting Audios Using Acoustic Properties for Emotion Representation" by Hira Dhamyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on Emotion Audio Retrieval (EAR) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), which suggests that specific datasets are used for these evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Work)**, where the authors mention using **six emotion datasets**. They provide a table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their details, including the number of files and classes of emotions represented. This section is crucial as it directly outlines the datasets used in their experiments.

The datasets listed in Table 1 are:

1. **CMU-MOSEI**: Contains 23,000 files with 9 emotion classes.
2. **IEMOCAP**: Contains 10,000 files with 9 emotion classes.
3. **MELD**: Contains 10,000 files with 7 emotion classes.
4. **CREMA-D**: Contains 7,000 files with 6 emotion classes.
5. **RAVDESS**: Contains 2,500 files with 8 emotion classes.
6. **CMU-MOSI**: Contains 2,200 files with 3 emotion classes.

I will then verify the details of each dataset by checking the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
