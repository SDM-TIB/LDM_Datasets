There are more than 500K segments from a total of 175 individuals (108 AF subjects and 67 non-AF subjects), each with a duration of 25s sampled at 128 Hz and later downsampled to 32 Hz. The dataset includes three categories of signal labels, labeled as Poor, Good, and Excellent, with some labels generated by a model trained on human-labeled portions, resulting in imprecise labels.",
