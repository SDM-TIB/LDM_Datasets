To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partition Pooling for Convolutional Graph Network: Applications in Particle Physics" by M. Bachlechner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of convolutional graph networks for event reconstruction in particle physics, which suggests that datasets related to particle physics experiments may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (An Example Pooling Application)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (The Simulation)**, where the authors describe a simulation of a neutrino detector. Here, they mention generating a dataset of 10^6 point-like events uniformly distributed over the target volume of a cylindrical liquid scintillator detector. This indicates that a dataset was created specifically for their experiments.

In this section, the authors provide details about the simulation parameters, including the number of initial scintillation photons and the detector's geometry. However, they do not provide a formal name for the dataset, which is common in simulation studies. I will note that this dataset is derived from their simulation of a neutrino detector.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works in particle physics rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Neutrino Detector Simulation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000,000 simulated events generated for a cylindrical liquid scintillator detector. The events are uniformly distributed over the detector volume, and the dataset includes parameters such as the number of detected photons and their arrival times.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details about the dataset and its context within the research.

Finally, I will prepare to present the dataset entry, ensuring that I clearly indicate that the dataset is derived from the authors' simulation and does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.
