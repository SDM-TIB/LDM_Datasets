To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCOTCH and SODA: A Transformer Video Shadow Detection Framework" by Lihao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors refer to a new shadow detection framework but do not specify datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **ViSha dataset** for evaluation. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and characteristics.

The authors describe the **ViSha dataset** as follows: it consists of 120 videos, with each video containing between 29 and 101 frames, totaling 11,685 frames across 390 seconds of video. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ViSha dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the ViSha dataset, which is:

- **ViSha Dataset Citation**:
  > Zhihao Chen, Liang Wan, Lei Zhu, Jia Shen, Huazhu Fu, Wennan Liu, and Jing Qin. *Triple-cooperative video shadow detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2715â€“2724, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ViSha dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
