To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Recommendation on Temporal Proximities with Contrastive Learning and Self-Attention" by Hansol Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they validate their work through comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Amazon Beauty Dataset**: This dataset consists of product reviews from Amazon in the beauty category. It is noted for being highly sparse and includes timestamp information.

2. **Amazon Book Dataset**: Similar to the Beauty dataset, this dataset contains product reviews from the book category on Amazon, also characterized by high sparsity.

3. **Amazon Video Games Dataset**: This dataset includes reviews of video games from Amazon, again with timestamp information and high sparsity.

4. **Steam Dataset**: This dataset includes information about games from the Steam platform, such as user play hours and media scores. It is also noted for its sparsity.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The authors may reference the original sources or papers that introduced these datasets. 

For the **Amazon Beauty Dataset**, the citation is:
> He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (pp. 507-517).

For the **Amazon Book Dataset**, the citation is:
> He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Fusing similarity models with Markov chains for sparse sequential recommendation. In 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) (pp. 191-200).

For the **Amazon Video Games Dataset**, the citation is:
> He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (pp. 507-517).

For the **Steam Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kang, W.-C., & McAuley, J. (2018). Self-attentive sequential recommendation. In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) (pp. 197-206).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
