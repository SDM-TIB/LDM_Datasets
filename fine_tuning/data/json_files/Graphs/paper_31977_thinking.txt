To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Having Beer after Prayer? Measuring Cultural Bias in Large Language Models" by Tarek Naous et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a novel resource called **CAMeL**, which consists of prompts and entities for measuring cultural biases in language models. This suggests that CAMeL is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **CAMeL dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe CAMeL as containing **628 naturally-occurring prompts and 20,368 entities** that contrast Arab and Western cultures. They also mention that these entities were extracted from **Wikidata and CommonCrawl**, covering various types such as person names, food dishes, beverages, and more.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss how they used CAMeL to evaluate the performance of 16 different language models on tasks like story generation, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis. This confirms that CAMeL is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper states that CAMeL will be made publicly available at a specific GitHub repository, which is crucial for citation purposes.

The citation for the CAMeL dataset is:
> Naous, T., Ryan, M. J., Ritter, A., & Xu, W. (2023). *CAMeL: Cultural Appropriateness Measure Set for Language Models*. Available at: https://github.com/tareknaous/camel

Additionally, the authors mention that the entities were extracted from **Wikidata** and **CommonCrawl**. I will provide citations for these sources as well:

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Vrandečić, D., & Krötzsch, M. (2014). *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. Communications of the ACM, 57(10), 78-85.

- For **CommonCrawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. (n.d.). *Common Crawl*. Retrieved from https://commoncrawl.org/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the CAMeL dataset along with its components and the sources from which the entities were extracted.
