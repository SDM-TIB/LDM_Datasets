To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks" by Yujia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which typically includes the datasets they used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **bAbI dataset** for their experiments. They describe the bAbI tasks as a set of tasks designed to test reasoning capabilities in AI systems. They also mention generating synthetic datasets for their program verification tasks, which are based on separation logic formulas and heap graphs.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **bAbI Dataset**: The citation for the bAbI dataset is:
   > Weston, Jason, Bordes, Antoine, Chopra, Sumit, and Mikolov, Tomas. *Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.05698, 2015.

2. **Synthetic Datasets for Program Verification**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the synthetic datasets they generated, as these are created as part of their experimental setup. However, they reference their previous work for context:
   > Brockschmidt, Marc, Chen, Yuxin, Cook, Byron, Kohli, Pushmeet, and Tarlow, Daniel. *Learning to decipher the heap for program verification*. In Workshop on Constructive Machine Learning at the International Conference on Machine Learning (CMLICML), 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
