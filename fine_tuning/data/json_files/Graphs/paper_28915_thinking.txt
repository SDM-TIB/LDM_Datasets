To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity and Generalization: from Noise to Corruption" by Nayara Fonseca and Veronica Guidetti, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will pay close attention to any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets used in their experiments. I will note any datasets mentioned here as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **FMNIST Dataset**: A dataset of fashion items, intended as a more challenging replacement for MNIST.
   - Citation: Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. URL: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

4. **EMNIST Dataset**: An extension of the MNIST dataset to handwritten letters.
   - Citation: G. Cohen, S. Afshar, J. Tapson, and A. van Schaik. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. 2017. URL: https://github.com/hosford42/EMNIST.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work or analysis. This ensures that the datasets are properly documented and can be accessed by others interested in replicating or building upon this research.
