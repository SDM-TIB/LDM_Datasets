To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrast and Mix: Temporal Contrastive Video Domain Adaptation with Background Mixing" by Aadarsh Sahoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **UCF-HMDB Dataset**: This dataset is described as an overlapped subset of the original UCF and HMDB datasets, containing 3,209 videos across 12 action classes. The authors note that it is used for two transfer tasks: UCF→HMDB and HMDB→UCF.

2. **Jester Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a large-scale dataset consisting of videos of humans performing hand gestures, with a total of 148,092 videos across 27 action classes. They mention that a cross-domain dataset is constructed from it for their experiments.

3. **Epic-Kitchens Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a challenging egocentric dataset consisting of videos capturing daily activities in kitchens, with a total of 1543 training videos and 435 test videos across three domains.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCF-HMDB Dataset**:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A Large Video Database for Human Motion Recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563. IEEE.

- For **Jester Dataset**:
  > Materzynska, J., Berger, G., Bax, I., & Memisevic, R. (2019). *The Jester Dataset: A Large-Scale Video Dataset of Human Gestures*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pages 0–0.

- For **Epic-Kitchens Dataset**:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, W., Price, W., et al. (2018). *Scaling Egocentric Vision: The Epic-Kitchens Dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 720–736.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
