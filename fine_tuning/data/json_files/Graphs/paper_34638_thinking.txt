To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Road Network Representation Learning with the Third Law of Geography" by Haicang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on "two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might contain dataset information. In this case, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention using data from **Singapore** and **New York City (NYC)**, which are the two datasets of interest.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of roads, edges, and street view images (SVIs) for each city:

1. **Singapore Dataset**:
   - Number of Roads: 45,243
   - Number of Edges: 138,843
   - Number of SVIs: 136,399

2. **New York City Dataset**:
   - Number of Roads: 139,320
   - Number of Edges: 524,565
   - Number of SVIs: 254,239

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference data sources such as **OpenStreetMap** and **Google Maps** for the datasets:

- For the **OpenStreetMap** data, the citation is:
  > OpenStreetMap contributors. Planet dump retrieved from https://planet.osm.org. https://www.openstreetmap.org, 2017.

- For the **Google Maps** street view images, the citation is:
  > GoogleMaps. Google maps. https://www.google.com/maps, 2023.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
