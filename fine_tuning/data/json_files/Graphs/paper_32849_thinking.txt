To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inclusive Data Representation in Federated Learning: A Novel Approach Integrating Textual and Visual Prompt" by Zihao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific dataset names and descriptions in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning and mention the need for diverse datasets but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach in detail.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Evaluation setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention evaluating their model on **seven different datasets**: 

1. **Caltech-101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
2. **Oxford-Pets**: A dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs.
3. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset with images of various car models.
4. **Oxford Flowers-102**: A dataset containing images of 102 flower categories.
5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use classification based on satellite images.
6. **UCF-101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.
7. **Describable Textures (DTD)**: A dataset for texture recognition.

I will now check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **Caltech-101**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
