To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Graph Representations for Procedural Instructional Documents" by Shruti Singh and Rishabh Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several datasets relevant to document similarity tasks, including the **CNSE** and **CNSS** datasets, which are specifically curated for evaluating the performance of their proposed method. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **CNSE Dataset**: The Chinese News Same Event dataset is curated to evaluate the performance of JCIG in document matching. It contains pairs of news articles with binary labels indicating whether they discuss the same event or story.

2. **CNSS Dataset**: The Chinese News Same Story dataset is similar to CNSE and is also used for evaluating document matching. It contains news stories collected from various sources, with the same binary labeling as CNSE.

3. **IFIXIT Dataset**: This dataset consists of instruction manuals curated from the IFIXIT website, specifically focusing on appliance repair and assembly. It contains 1333 manuals across various categories and is used to construct positive and negative document pairs based on shared subjects and tags.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CNSE and CNSS datasets**, the citation is:
  > Liu, B., Niu, D., Wei, H., Lin, J., He, Y., Lai, K., Xu, Y. (2019). *Matching article pairs with graphical decomposition and convolutions*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 6284–6294). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **IFIXIT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nandy, A., Sharma, S., Maddhashiya, S., Sachdeva, K., Goyal, P., Ganguly, N. (2021). *Question answering over electronic devices: A new benchmark dataset and a multi-task learning based QA framework*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021 (pp. 4600–4609). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
