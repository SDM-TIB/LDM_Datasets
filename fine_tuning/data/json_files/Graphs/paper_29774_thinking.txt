To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gender Artifacts in Visual Datasets" by Nicole Meister et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate gender artifacts in large-scale visual datasets, specifically highlighting the **COCO** and **OpenImages** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **setup section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly state that they focus their analysis on the **COCO** and **OpenImages** datasets. They provide details about how gender labels are derived from these datasets, confirming their relevance to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their methodology and findings related to these datasets. They mention that both datasets are skewed towards male representations, with specific percentages provided (69.2% for COCO and 62.9% for OpenImages). This further emphasizes the importance of these datasets in their analysis of gender artifacts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **OpenImages dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 128(7):1956–1981, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
