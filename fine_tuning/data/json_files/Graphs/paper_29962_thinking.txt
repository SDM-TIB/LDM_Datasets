To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LocVTP: Video-Text Pre-training for Temporal Localization" by Meng Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four downstream tasks across six datasets, indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify the specific datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Settings of Pre-training)**, the authors list three public datasets used for pre-training their model:

1. **HowTo100M**: This dataset consists of more than 1.2 million videos accompanied by ASR-generated speech transcriptions. It is used to create video-sentence pairs separated by timestamps.

2. **WebVid-2M**: This dataset contains about 2.5 million well-aligned web video-text pairs.

3. **Google Conceptual Captions**: This dataset includes 3.3 million image and description pairs harvested from the web.

In **section 4.2 (Transfer Results on Video Retrieval)**, the authors evaluate their model on the **MSR-VTT dataset**, which is composed of 10,000 YouTube videos (9,000 for training and 1,000 for testing).

In **section 4.3 (Transfer Results on Temporal Grounding)**, they mention three additional datasets used for temporal grounding:

1. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset contains 20,000 untrimmed videos with 100,000 descriptions.

2. **Charades-STA**: This dataset includes 12,408 video-query pairs for training and 3,720 pairs for testing.

3. **TACoS**: This dataset has 10,146 video-query pairs for training, 4,589 pairs for validation, and 4,083 pairs for testing.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
