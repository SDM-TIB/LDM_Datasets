To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstantEmbedding: Efficient Local Node Representations" by Stefan Postavaru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "real-world datasets with over a billion edges," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their sizes, and any relevant attributes.

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)**: This dataset contains interactions for Homo sapiens and is used for biological state classification.
2. **BlogCatalog**: A social interaction network among bloggers, with categories specified for each blog.
3. **CoCit (Co-Citation)**: A subgraph of the Microsoft Academic Graph, representing co-citation relationships among scientific papers.
4. **CoAuthor**: Another subgraph of the Microsoft Academic Graph, representing co-authorship relationships.
5. **Flickr**: A contact network of users within randomly sampled interest groups.
6. **YouTube**: A social network of users on the video-sharing platform, with labels based on interest groups.
7. **Amazon2M**: A network of products based on co-purchased relations.
8. **Orkut**: A social network where users can create and join groups.
9. **Friendster**: A social network allowing users to form friendships and groups.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, but I will look for any papers or sources that describe them.

For example, the citation for the PPI dataset is:
> Stark, C., Breitkreutz, B.-J., Reguly, T., Boucher, L., Breitkreutz, A., & Tyers, M. (2006). Biogrid: a general repository for interaction datasets. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 34(suppl 1), D535â€“D539. https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/Homo_sapiens.mat

For the BlogCatalog dataset, the citation is:
> Tang, J., & Liu, H. (2010). Social dimension approach to classification in large-scale networks. URL http://leitang.net/social_dimension.html.

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring that I gather accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
