To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Modality-Transferable Video Highlight Detection With Representation Activation Sequence Learning" by Tingtian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of highlight detection in videos and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Evaluation datasets** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **YouTube Highlights Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6 specific categories (surfing, skating, skiing, gymnastics, parkour, and dog), with each category containing 100 segment-level annotated videos, totaling approximately 1,430 minutes of video.

2. **TVSum Dataset**: This dataset includes 10 specific categories, with 5 frame-level annotated videos in each category.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **YouTube Highlights Dataset**, the citation is:
> M. Sun, A. Farhadi, and S. Seitz. *Ranking domain-specific highlights by analyzing edited videos*. In European conference on computer vision. Springer, 2014, pp. 787–802.

For the **TVSum Dataset**, the citation is:
> Y. Song, J. Vallmitjana, A. Stent, and A. Jaimes. *Tvsum: Summarizing web videos using titles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2015, pp. 5179–5187.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
