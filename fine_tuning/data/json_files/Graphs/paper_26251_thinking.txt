To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral Image Classification With Context-Aware Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network" by Sheng Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on **three real-world benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section IV)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They describe three datasets:

1. **Indian Pines**: This dataset was gathered by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer sensor in 1992, consisting of 145 × 145 pixels with a spatial resolution of 20 m × 20 m and 200 spectral channels. The ground truth includes 16 land-cover classes.

2. **University of Pavia**: Captured by the ROSIS sensor, this dataset consists of 610 × 340 pixels with a spatial resolution of 1.3 m and 103 spectral channels. It includes 9 land-cover classes.

3. **Salinas**: Collected by the AVIRIS sensor, this dataset comprises 204 spectral bands and 512 × 217 pixels with a spatial resolution of 3.7 m. It contains 16 land-cover classes.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors summarize the effectiveness of their proposed method on these datasets, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
