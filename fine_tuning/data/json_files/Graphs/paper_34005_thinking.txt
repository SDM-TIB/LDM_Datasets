To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Granular Change Accuracy: A More Accurate Performance Metric for Dialogue State Tracking" by Taha Aksu and Nancy F. Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new metric for evaluating Dialogue State Tracking (DST) systems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction references existing metrics and their limitations, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their proposed Granular Change Accuracy (GCA) metric on the **MultiWOZ 2.1** and **SGD** datasets. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper. The authors provide some context about the datasets in the experiments section, stating that they benchmark GCA against other DST metrics using these datasets. However, I need to confirm the full citations for these datasets.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will locate the entries for the MultiWOZ 2.1 and SGD datasets:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: The citation is:
   > Eric, M., Goel, R., Paul, S., Sethi, A., Agarwal, S., Gao, S., Kumar, A., Goyal, A., Ku, P., & Hakkani-Tur, D. (2020). MultiWOZ 2.1: A consolidated multi-domain dialogue dataset with state corrections and state tracking baselines. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 422–428, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

2. **SGD (Schema-Guided Dialogue)**: The citation is:
   > Rastogi, A., Zang, X., Sunkara, S., Gupta, R., & Khaitan, P. (2020). Towards scalable multi-domain conversational agents: The schema-guided dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34, pages 8689–8696.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
