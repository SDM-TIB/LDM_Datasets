To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Modeling in Density Functional Theory on Citations of Condensed Matter Electronic Structure Packages" by Marie Dumaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset of research papers focused on Density Functional Theory (DFT) by downloading articles from the Web of Science database. This suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that they downloaded all articles citing commonly used computational packages related to DFT, which provides context for the dataset's content. They also specify that the dataset includes papers from the first citation up to 2019 for the training set and all citations from 2020 for the test set.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the distribution of documents over topics and provide insights into the dataset's characteristics. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for the datasets used, as the focus is more on the analysis of the dataset rather than on external datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The authors mention that the dataset supporting their findings is available in Figshare with the identifier https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12494654.v2. This is crucial as it provides a direct link to the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **Dataset Name**: DFT-related research papers dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of research papers focused on Density Functional Theory, obtained from the Web of Science database, including papers from the first citation up to 2019 for training and all citations in 2020 for testing.
   - **Citation**: Dumaz, M., Romero-Bohórquez, C., Adjeroh, D., & Romero, A. H. (2021). Authorship and citation cultural nature in Density Functional Theory from solid state computational packages. *Scientometrics*, 126(8), 6681–6695. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12494654.v2

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
