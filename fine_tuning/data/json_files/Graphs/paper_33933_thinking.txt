To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jet Discrimination with Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network" by Yi-An Chen and Kai-Feng Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of the Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN) for jet discrimination, which suggests that datasets related to jet events might be discussed. The introduction elaborates on the context of jet discrimination in high-energy physics, indicating that datasets are likely to be referenced.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the Monte Carlo simulations for jet discrimination are generated using specific tools. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets or data generation methods.

In **section III.A (Dataset for Jet Discrimination)**, the authors specify that they randomly select 5000 data points uniformly distributed in the region of interest for their experiments. They also mention the number of particles and the thresholds for the dataset. This section provides crucial details about the dataset used for training and testing the QCGNN model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to several simulation tools and methods, which may not be datasets in the traditional sense but are essential for understanding the data generation process. The relevant citations include:

1. **MadGraph5**: 
   > J. Alwall et al., "The automated computation of tree-level and next-to-leading order differential cross sections, and their matching to parton shower simulations," JHEP 07, 079, arXiv:1405.0301 [hep-ph].

2. **Pythia8**: 
   > C. Bierlich et al., "A comprehensive guide to the physics and usage of pythia 8.3," arXiv:2203.11601 [hep-ph].

3. **Delphes**: 
   > S. Ovyn et al., "Delphes, a framework for fast simulation of a generic collider experiment," arXiv:0903.2225 [hep-ph].

These citations provide the necessary references for the datasets generated through these simulation tools.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
