To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Clicks: Modeling Multi-Relational Item Graph for Session-Based Target Behavior Prediction" by Wen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **WeChat Dataset**: This dataset is collected from WeChat's Top Stories feature, involving user behavior records over a week. It consists of 100,000 active users and includes various behaviors such as sharing and clicking.

2. **Yoochoose Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains user behavior sequences that are already segmented into sessions. It includes anonymized user interactions over a specific time frame.

In this section, the authors provide detailed statistics about both datasets, including the number of items, sessions, and types of behaviors recorded. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets:

- For the **WeChat Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is described as collected from WeChat's Top Stories feature.

- For the **Yoochoose Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Yoochoose dataset from the RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge.html"

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
