To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Curriculum Graph Contrastive Learning with Pair-wise Augmentation" by Liang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on six well-known benchmark datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are used, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the provided text, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on six benchmark datasets, which are listed in the **experiments section**. I will carefully note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Cora**: A dataset commonly used for node classification tasks in graph neural networks.
2. **Citeseer**: Another widely used dataset for evaluating graph-based learning methods.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset that contains scientific publications, often used in citation network tasks.
4. **Amazon-Computers**: A dataset from Amazon reviews, used for recommendation tasks.
5. **DBLP**: A dataset containing bibliographic information on computer science publications.
6. **Coauthor Physics**: A dataset that includes co-authorship information in the field of physics.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. 

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- **Cora**: 
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > William L. Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, 2017.

- **PubMed**: 
  > Kaveh Hassani and Amir Hosein Khasahmadi. *Contrastive multi-view representation learning on graphs*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR, 4116–4126, 2020.

- **Amazon-Computers**: 
  > Oleksandr Shchur et al. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.

- **DBLP**: 
  > Jie Tang et al. *Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, 990–998, 2008.

- **Coauthor Physics**: 
  > Shichang Zhang et al. *Motif-driven contrastive learning of graph representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.12533, 2020.

After gathering the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or analysis.
