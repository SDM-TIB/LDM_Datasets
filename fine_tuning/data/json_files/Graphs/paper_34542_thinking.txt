To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradually Vanishing Gap in Prototypical Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Shanshan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on several UDA benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on five public datasets, which are crucial for understanding the context of their research. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Office-31**: A benchmark dataset consisting of 4,110 images across 31 classes, with three domains: Amazon, Webcam, and DSLR.
2. **ImageCLEF-DA**: A dataset used for the ImageCLEF-DA 2014 domain adaptation challenge, comprising three domains: Caltech-256, ImageNet ILSVRC 2012, and Pascal VOC 2012.
3. **Office-Home**: A dataset with 15,500 images across four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World.
4. **VisDA-2017**: A large-scale dataset with synthetic and real image domains, containing 12 categories.
5. **DomainNet**: A large dataset with 345 categories and approximately 600,000 images across six domains.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Office-31**:
  > K. Saenko, B. Kulis, M. Fritz, and T. Darrell. "Adapting visual category models to new domains." In *ECCV*, 2010.

- **ImageCLEF-DA**:
  > B. Caputo, H. MÃ¼ller, J. Martinez-Gomez, et al. "ImageCLEF 2014: Overview and analysis of the results." *Information Access Evaluation*, 2014.

- **Office-Home**:
  > H. Venkateswara, J. Eusebio, S. Chakraborty, and S. Panchanathan. "Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation." In *CVPR*, 2017.

- **VisDA-2017**:
  > X. Peng, B. Usman, N. Kaushik, et al. "VisDA: The visual domain adaptation challenge." *arXiv*, 2017.

- **DomainNet**:
  > X. Peng, Q. Bai, X. Xia, et al. "Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation." In *ICCV*, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
