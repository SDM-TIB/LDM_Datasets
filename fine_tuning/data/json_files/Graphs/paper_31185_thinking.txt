To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated contrastive learning models for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading" by Fei Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on "19,635 prostate cancer WSIs from multiple clients," which suggests a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for the cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading tasks. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors mention several datasets used for the diagnosis task, including:

1. **HB-1**: 1201 WSIs (21% positive)
2. **HB-2**: 844 WSIs (73% positive)
3. **NC**: 983 WSIs (90% positive)
4. **DiagSet-B-a**: 2313 WSIs (45% positive)
5. **DiagSet-B-b**: 2313 WSIs (45% positive)
6. **PANDA-a**: 5453 WSIs (65% positive)
7. **PANDA-b**: 5159 WSIs (81% positive)

For the Gleason grading task, the authors mention using two private datasets and one public dataset for training, and one private hospital dataset (NC) for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper references the following:

- **PANDA dataset**: 
  > Bulten, W., et al. (2022). "Artificial intelligence for diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer: the PANDA challenge." *Nature Medicine*, 28(1), 154-163.

- **DiagSet-A**: 
  > Bulten, W., et al. (2020). "Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study." *The Lancet Oncology*, 21(2), 233-241.

- **NC dataset**: Specific citation not provided in the text, but it is likely a dataset from a private institution.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their respective citations for further reference.
