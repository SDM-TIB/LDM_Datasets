To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Correlation Consistency for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Yunzhong Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors report competitive accuracy on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is used for urban street scene understanding and consists of 2,975 training images and 500 validation images across 19 different semantic classes.

2. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This is a generic object dataset that contains 1,464 training images and 1,449 validation images across 21 distinct semantic classes. The authors also mention that they include an augmented partition for a combined training set totaling 10,582 images.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper attribution.
