To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEAR: Contrastive Learning for Sentence Representation" by Fei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, CLEAR, is evaluated on the **GLUE** and **SentEval** benchmarks, which indicates that these benchmarks may involve specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors describe the pre-training data as a combination of **BookCorpus** and **English Wikipedia** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are essential for the experiments conducted.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **BookCorpus**: The citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 19â€“27.

2. **English Wikipedia**: Since this is a widely used dataset, it may not have a specific citation in the references. However, it is generally acknowledged as a standard dataset for NLP tasks. I will note that it is derived from the Wikipedia dump, which is publicly available.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
