To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Basket Recommendation via Noise-tolerated Graph Contrastive Learning" by Tianxin Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three shopping transaction datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note the names of these datasets as I come across them.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically contains the names of the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of users, items, average basket size, and other relevant metrics.

In this paper, the datasets mentioned are:

1. **Instacart**: A dataset collected from an online grocery shopping platform, containing over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users.
2. **Tafeng**: A dataset consisting of transaction data from Chinese grocery stores, with records from over 13,000 users.
3. **Valuedshoppers**: A dataset that includes nearly 350 million purchase histories from over 300,000 shoppers.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- **Instacart**: 
  > Instacart. *Instacart Market Basket Analysis*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis.

- **Tafeng**: 
  > Tafeng. *TaFeng Grocery Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/chiranjivdas09/ta-feng-grocery-dataset.

- **Valuedshoppers**: 
  > Valuedshoppers. *Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
