To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning from Decentralized Data" by Weiming Zhuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of decentralized unlabeled image data, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of decentralized image data and refer to "real-world street datasets" as an example. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will check the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for linear and semi-supervised evaluations. This is a clear indication that these datasets are part of their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology** or **results** sections. The authors refer to the **Mini-ImageNet** dataset for transfer learning evaluation, which is another dataset to note.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since they are from the same source:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Mini-ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.04080, 2016.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their corresponding references.
