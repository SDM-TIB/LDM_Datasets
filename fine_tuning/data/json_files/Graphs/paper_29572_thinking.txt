To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Travel Time, Distance and Costs Optimization for Paratransit Operations using Graph Convolutional Neural Network" by Kelvin Kwakye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that a **randomized simulated dataset** was used, which suggests that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the operational scenarios considered in the study. They mention that the dataset includes **randomly generated pick-up points (x, y) coordinates** representing latitudes and longitudes, specifically using Greensboro, NC as a reference point. This indicates that the dataset is not a standard dataset but rather a custom one created for the study.

In addition, the authors discuss the **Euclidean distances** calculated for the generated cost, which is part of the dataset used for their analysis. However, they do not provide a formal name or citation for this dataset, as it appears to be a simulation rather than a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or its characteristics. The results indicate that various scenarios were simulated, including different numbers of requests (10, 15, 20, 30, 40) and vehicle capacities (10, 15, 20). However, these details do not refer to an external dataset but rather to the parameters of the simulation.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, it appears that the paper primarily relies on the simulated dataset created for the study, and no external datasets are referenced.

In conclusion, the main dataset extracted from this paper is a **randomized simulated dataset** that includes:
- Randomly generated pick-up points (latitude and longitude) based on Greensboro, NC.
- Calculated costs using Euclidean distances based on the generated coordinates.

Since this dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the purposes of this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing.
