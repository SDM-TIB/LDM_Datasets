To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Astronomical Images" by Md Abul Hayat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using **multi-band galaxy photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** and the **Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for further details. The authors discuss the importance of SDSS and Galaxy Zoo in the context of astronomical research, which reinforces their significance as datasets used in the study.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **Appendix A**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They describe the **SDSS dataset**, which includes 1.3 million galaxy images with specific characteristics, and the **Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset**, which contains morphological classifications for 304,122 galaxies. This section will be critical for understanding the specifics of how these datasets were utilized.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to confirm the datasets' roles in the analysis. The authors mention using the SDSS dataset for galaxy morphology classification and photometric redshift estimation, which further validates their importance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**:
   - Citation:
     > Alam, S., Albareti, F. D., Prieto, C. A., et al. 2015, The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 219, 12.

2. **Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2)**:
   - Citation:
     > Willett, K. W., Lintott, C. J., Bamford, S. P., et al. 2013, MNRAS, 435, 2835, doi: 10.1093/mnras/stt1458.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
