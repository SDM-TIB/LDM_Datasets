To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Region-centric Image-Language Pretraining for Open-Vocabulary Detection" by Dahun Kim, Anelia Angelova, and Weicheng Kuo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **LVIS open-vocabulary detection benchmark** and the **DataComp-1B dataset**, which indicates that these are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors report their results on the LVIS benchmark and mention that their approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 37.6 mask Average Precision (APr) using the **DataComp-1B dataset**. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

1. **LVIS Dataset**:
   > Gupta, A., et al. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

2. **DataComp-1B Dataset**:
   > Gadre, S.Y., et al. *Datacomp: In Search of the Next Generation of Multi-modal Datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.14108, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured output of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
