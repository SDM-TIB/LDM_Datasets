To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Adversarial Examples with Graph Neural Networks" by Florian Jaeckle and M. Pawan Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a "new challenging dataset specifically designed to allow for a more illustrative comparison of adversarial attacks." This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (A New Dataset for Comparing Adversarial Attacks)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is based on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and is designed for three different neural networks: the 'Base', 'Wide', and 'Deep' models. The authors explain how they generated the dataset and the properties included, which is crucial for understanding its structure and purpose.

In this section, they also mention the number of properties generated for each model:
- **Base Model**: 641 properties
- **Wide Model**: 303 properties
- **Deep Model**: 250 properties

The authors describe the generation process, which involves selecting images from the CIFAR-10 test set and ensuring that adversarial examples exist for each property. This detailed explanation confirms the dataset's relevance and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is essential for proper attribution. The citation is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer.

Additionally, I will note that the authors created a validation dataset based on the same parameters used for the test dataset on the 'Base' model, consisting of 50 properties. This information is also relevant for dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the CIFAR-10 dataset and any other datasets mentioned in the paper.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Used as the basis for generating the new dataset.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer.
2. **New Dataset for Comparing Adversarial Attacks**: Generated from CIFAR-10 for three models with specific properties.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output.
