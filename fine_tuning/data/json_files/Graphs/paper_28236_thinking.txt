To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Node Feature Kernels Increase Graph Convolutional Network Robustness" by Mohamed El Amine Seddik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an empirical study on six real datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they utilized for node classification tasks. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A well-known citation network dataset used for node classification, containing 2,708 nodes, 5,208 edges, and 7 classes.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,552 edges, and 6 classes.

3. **PubMed Dataset**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.

4. **CoraFull Dataset**: An extended version of the Cora dataset with 18,703 nodes, 62,421 edges, and 67 classes.

5. **Photo Dataset**: An Amazon co-purchase graph with 7,487 nodes, 119,043 edges, and 8 classes.

6. **Co-author Network (CS)**: A co-author network from the Computer Science domain with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, and 15 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the literature, they may not have specific citations in the references but are well-known in the research community.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset where applicable.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
