To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Aware Multi-Intent Contrastive Learning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation" by Shunpan Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (specifically section 5.1.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets: **Movielens**, **Yelp**, and **Tmall**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, and any relevant statistics.

In the **table 1** within the experiments section, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, which includes:
- **Movielens**: 
  - User-Item Interaction: 67,788 users, 8,704 items, 9.9 million interactions.
  - Knowledge Graph: 11,636 entities, 4 relations, 76,879 triplets.
- **Yelp**: 
  - User-Item Interaction: 45,794 users, 43,653 items, 2.1 million interactions.
  - Knowledge Graph: 48,144 entities, 25 relations, 703,285 triplets.
- **Tmall**: 
  - User-Item Interaction: 103,469 users, 4 relations, 800,864 triplets.
  - Knowledge Graph: 15,902 entities, 53,721 relations, 4.4 million triplets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors mention that they used the following datasets:
- For **Movielens**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *Movielens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/
  
- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download
  
- For **Tmall**, the citation is:
  > H. Xuan, Y. Liu, B. Li, and H. Yin. *Knowledge enhancement for contrastive multi-behavior recommendation*. In Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
