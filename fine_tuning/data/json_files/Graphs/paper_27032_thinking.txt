To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geography-Aware Self-Supervised Learning" by Kumar Ayush et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors explore their methods on geo-located datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. In section 3, the authors describe two main datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Functional Map of the World (fMoW)**: This dataset is highlighted as a large-scale remote sensing dataset consisting of approximately 363,571 training images and 53,041 test images across 62 categories. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure, including temporal views and geo-location metadata.

2. **GeoImageNet**: This dataset is derived from ImageNet, where the authors extracted geo-coordinates for a subset of images using the FLICKR API. It contains 543,435 geo-tagged images across 5,150 class categories, making it a more challenging dataset than the standard ImageNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Functional Map of the World (fMoW)**, the citation is:
  > Gordon Christie, Neil Fendley, James Wilson, and Ryan Mukherjee. *Functional map of the world*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6172–6180, 2018.

- For **GeoImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Terrance de Vries, Ishan Misra, Changhan Wang, and Laurens van der Maaten. *Does object recognition work for everyone?* In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 52–59, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
