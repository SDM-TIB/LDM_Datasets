To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Adversarial Robustness of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation" by Jiacen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **background and related works section** to identify any datasets that are commonly used in the field of point cloud semantic segmentation. This section often provides context and may mention datasets that are relevant to the authors' work.

Then, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **S3DIS** and **Semantic3D** datasets for their evaluations. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

1. **S3DIS Dataset**: The authors describe it as an indoor dataset composed of 3D point clouds collected in various areas of buildings, with 13 class labels. Each point cloud contains 4,096 points, and each point has 9 features.

2. **Semantic3D Dataset**: This is an outdoor dataset that contains large-scale point clouds with coordinates, color channels, and intensity in 8 classes. Each point cloud has over 108 points.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. (2016). 3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1534â€“1543.

- For **Semantic3D**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
