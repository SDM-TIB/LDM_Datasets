To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyper Meta-Path Contrastive Learning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation" by Haoran Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses user purchasing prediction and mentions the use of multi-behavior information, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets: **Taobao** and **Tmall**. I will take note of the statistics provided for each dataset, which include the number of users, items, and various interaction types (page views, favorites, cart actions, and purchases).

The statistics for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Taobao Dataset**:
   - Number of users: 48,946
   - Number of items: 1,500,839
   - Total interactions: 9,068,030
   - Interaction percentages: 
     - Page views: 85.17%
     - Favorites: 4.82%
     - Cart: 5.81%
     - Buy: 4.20%

2. **Tmall Dataset**:
   - Number of users: 9,368
   - Number of items: 302,722
   - Total interactions: 1,639,220
   - Interaction percentages:
     - Page views: 92.14%
     - Favorites: 6.25%
     - Cart: 1.50%
     - Buy: 6.37%

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides links to the datasets, which are hosted on the Tianchi platform. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Taobao Dataset**:
  > Taobao. *Taobao Dataset*. Available: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649

- For the **Tmall Dataset**:
  > Tmall. *Tmall Dataset*. Available: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=47

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
