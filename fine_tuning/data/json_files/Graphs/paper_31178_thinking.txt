To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning" by Jiacheng Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on **12 classification and generation datasets from 7 distinct NLP tasks**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **SST-5**: A sentiment classification benchmark containing five fine-grained classes including ‘very positive’, ‘positive’, ‘neutral’, ‘negative’, and ‘very negative’.
2. **MRPC**: A corpus of sentence pairs with human annotations for semantic equivalence, extracted from online news sources.
3. **MNLI**: A collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations, where the task is to predict entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.
4. **QNLI**: A question-answering dataset consisting of question-paragraph pairs, determining if the context contains the answer.
5. **CMSQA**: A multiple-choice question-answering dataset requiring commonsense knowledge.
6. **HellaSwag**: A dataset for grounded commonsense reasoning with adversarially generated incorrect answers.
7. **WebQs**: Question-answer pairs obtained from the web, with answers being entities in Freebase.
8. **NL2Bash**: A dataset mapping English sentences to Bash commands, consisting of text-command pairs.
9. **GeoQuery**: A parallel corpus of questions about US geography paired with Prolog queries.
10. **Break**: A dataset mapping complex natural language questions into a language-based meaning representation.
11. **MTOP**: A multilingual task-oriented semantic parsing dataset covering multiple languages and domains.
12. **SMCalFlow**: A dialogue dataset featuring natural conversations about tasks involving calendars, weather, places, and people.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
