To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-based Structure-from-Orbit" by Ethan Elms et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors produced a new event dataset for evaluating their proposed method, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe the dataset as consisting of six objects placed on a turntable, observed by a static event camera, and mention the various conditions under which the data was collected, including different rotational speeds and camera perspectives.

The dataset is named **TOPSPIN: Dataset Of Spinning objects with neuromorphic Vision**. The authors specify that it includes 72 scenes generated from combinations of six objects and three rotational speeds, observed from four different perspectives. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their dataset as follows:

- **TOPSPIN: Dataset Of Spinning objects with neuromorphic Vision**:
  > Ethan Elms. *TOPSPIN: Dataset Of Spinning objects with neuromorphic Vision*, 2024. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10884693.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **TOPSPIN Dataset**: A dataset consisting of six objects placed on a turntable, observed by a static event camera, with variations in rotational speeds and perspectives.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
