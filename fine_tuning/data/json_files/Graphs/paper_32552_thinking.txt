To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HRGCN: Heterogeneous Graph-level Anomaly Detection with Hierarchical Relation-augmented Graph Neural Networks" by Jiaxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on two real-world application datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **TraceLog Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a train ticket-based microservice system and is widely used for evaluating anomaly detection in system trace log sequences. It includes four fault classes and 14 fault subclasses for different faulty types.

2. **FlowGraph Dataset**: This dataset consists of heterogeneous user web browsing activities and contains 600 graphs, including one attack scenario and five normal scenarios.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as statistics and configurations. The appendix provides a detailed overview of both datasets, including the number of graphs, node types, and edge types.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the citations as follows:

- For the **TraceLog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, X., Peng, X., Xie, T., Sun, J., Ji, C., Li, W., & Ding, D. (2018). Fault analysis and debugging of microservice systems: Industrial survey, benchmark system, and empirical study. *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering*, 47(2), 243-260.

- For the **FlowGraph Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Manzoor, E., Milajerdi, S. M., & Akoglu, L. (2016). Fast memory-efficient anomaly detection in streaming heterogeneous graphs. In *Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1035-1044).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
