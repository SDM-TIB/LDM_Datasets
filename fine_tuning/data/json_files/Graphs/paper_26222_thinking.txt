To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KagNet: Knowledge-Aware Graph Networks for Commonsense Reasoning" by Bill Yuchen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **CommonsenseQA** dataset, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, particularly the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the **CommonsenseQA** dataset, which consists of 12,102 natural language questions requiring commonsense reasoning. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections for any additional datasets that may have been referenced or used for comparison. However, the primary focus appears to be on the **CommonsenseQA** dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **CommonsenseQA** dataset from the references section of the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge*. In Proceedings of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **CommonsenseQA** dataset, I will ensure that I document this dataset thoroughly, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
