To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Recommendation for Optimizing Both Immediate Feedback and Long-term Retention" by Ziru Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Kuairand-Pure**: This dataset is described as an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset featuring random video exposures. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **MovieLens-25M**: This is a widely-used benchmark dataset for sequential recommendation systems, known for its extensive scale but sparse distribution. The authors also provide a link to this dataset.

3. **RetailRocket**: This dataset is collected from a real-world e-commerce website, and the authors mention that item IDs have been reindexed to optimize the transformerâ€™s memory requirements. A link to the dataset is provided as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Kuairand-Pure**: 
  > Kuairand. *Kuairand-Pure Dataset*. Retrieved from https://kuairand.com/

- **MovieLens-25M**: 
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 25M Dataset*. Retrieved from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

- **RetailRocket**: 
  > RetailRocket. *RetailRocket Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
