To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Semantic Steganography Systems" by Jo√£o Figueira, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on semantic steganography but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction and background sections** to see if the author references any datasets used in previous studies or surveys. The introduction discusses the concepts of steganography but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **section discussing existing systems for semantic steganography**. This section may contain references to datasets used in the various steganography systems described. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the author primarily discusses methodologies and systems rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that might include datasets. The references list includes various papers and articles, but I will need to verify if any of these sources provide datasets relevant to the topic of semantic steganography.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that may pertain to datasets used in the context of semantic steganography. If any of the cited works mention datasets, I will extract their full citations to ensure proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets identified, even if they are indirectly referenced through the cited works. If no datasets are found, I will note that the paper primarily discusses theoretical frameworks and methodologies without providing specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will document my findings clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, if applicable, to maintain academic integrity and provide a comprehensive overview of the data landscape in semantic steganography.
