To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Interplay of Subset Selection and Informed Graph Neural Networks" by Niklas Breustedt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the QM9 dataset, which is a strong indication that it will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors highlight the importance of labeled datasets for machine learning in molecular property prediction. They specifically mention the QM9 dataset, indicating its relevance to their research.

In the **methods section**, particularly subsection 4.1 (QM9 Dataset), the authors provide a detailed description of the QM9 dataset. They state that it contains 133,885 organic molecules with various properties and that they preprocess the dataset to remove inconsistencies, resulting in a smaller version with 130,219 molecules. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset's composition and the preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the QM9 dataset is used for training and testing their models. The authors describe how they sample from the QM9 dataset using different strategies, which further emphasizes its importance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **QM9 dataset**:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1, 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The QM9 dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, and its citation is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent work or analysis.
