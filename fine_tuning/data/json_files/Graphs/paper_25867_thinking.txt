To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighborhood Mixture Model for Knowledge Base Completion" by Dat Quoc Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets for various tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three publicly available datasets: **WN11**, **FB13**, and **NELL186**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of entities, relation types, and the number of correct triples in the training, validation, and test sets.

The paper provides the following information about the datasets:

1. **WN11**: 
   - Number of relation types: 11
   - Number of entities: 38,696
   - Number of training triples: 112,581
   - Number of validation triples: 2,609
   - Number of test triples: 10,544

2. **FB13**: 
   - Number of relation types: 13
   - Number of entities: 75,043
   - Number of training triples: 316,232
   - Number of validation triples: 5,908
   - Number of test triples: 23,733

3. **NELL186**: 
   - Number of relation types: 186
   - Number of entities: 14,463
   - Number of training triples: 31,134
   - Number of validation triples: 5,000
   - Number of test triples: 5,000

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original sources of the datasets as follows:

- For **WN11**, the citation is:
  > Miller, G. A. (1995). WordNet: A Lexical Database for English. *Communications of the ACM*, 38(11), 39-41.

- For **FB13**, the citation is:
  > Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., & Taylor, J. (2008). Freebase: A Collaboratively Created Graph Database for Structuring Human Knowledge. In *Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data*, 1247-1250.

- For **NELL186**, the citation is:
  > Guo, S., Wang, Q., Wang, B., Wang, L., & Guo, L. (2015). Semantically Smooth Knowledge Graph Embedding. In *Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, 84-94.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
