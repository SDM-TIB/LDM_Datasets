To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Interactive Video Object Segmentation with Graph Neural Networks" by Viktor Varga and András Lőrincz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of pixelwise annotation and mentions the use of a graph neural network for video object segmentation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors reference existing methods and datasets. They mention the **DAVIS dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for video object segmentation. This indicates that it is likely used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors state that they use the **DAVIS 2017 training set** for training their model and the **DAVIS 2017 validation set** for testing. This confirms the datasets utilized in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **DAVIS Dataset**: The citation for the DAVIS dataset is:
   > J. Pont-Tuset, F. Perazzi, S. Caelles, P. Arbeláez, A. Sorkine-Hornung, and L. Van Gool. *The 2017 davis challenge on video object segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00675, 2017.

Since the authors specifically mention using the **DAVIS 2017 training set** and **DAVIS 2017 validation set**, I will ensure to reference the same citation for both.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured output of the datasets used in the research paper.
