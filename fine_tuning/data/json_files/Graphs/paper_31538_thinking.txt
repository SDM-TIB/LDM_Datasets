To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anatomically aware dual-hop learning for pulmonary embolism detection in CT pulmonary angiograms" by Florin Condrea et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **publicly available multicenter large-scale RSNA dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they performed experiments on the **RSNA dataset**, which contains approximately 7200 studies (CT scan volumes) with slice-level annotations regarding the presence of pulmonary embolism. They also note that around 400 studies were excluded due to segmentation model failures, leading to a final train/validation split of 6000/836 cases.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RSNA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **RSNA dataset**: 
  > Colak, E., et al. "The RSNA pulmonary embolism CT dataset." *Radiology: Artificial Intelligence*, vol. 3, no. 2, p. e200254, 2021. PMID: 33937862.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **RSNA Dataset**: A publicly available dataset containing approximately 7200 CT scan studies with annotations for pulmonary embolism detection. The dataset is used for training and validation in the study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
