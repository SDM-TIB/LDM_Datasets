To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Quality Estimation for Low Resource Corpus Mining" by Muhammed Yusuf Kocyigit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new method for quality estimation (QE) and mention using several datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (4.1)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MLQE Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Wikipedia articles and contains 7K training, 1K validation, and 1K test translation pairs. The authors provide a citation for this dataset:
   > Fomicheva et al. (2020a). *Unsupervised quality estimation for neural machine translation*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8:539–555.

2. **TATOEBA Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing performance on parallel corpus mining and contains various language pairs. The citation provided is:
   > Tiedemann (2020). *The Tatoeba translation challenge - realistic data sets for low resource and multilingual MT*. CoRR, abs/2010.06354.

3. **BUCC Dataset**: This dataset is also used for parallel corpus mining and is mentioned in the context of the BUCC challenge. The citation is:
   > Zweigenbaum et al. (2018). *Overview of the third BUCC shared task: Spotting parallel sentences in comparable corpora*. In Proceedings of 11th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 39–42.

4. **OPUS Dataset**: This dataset is used for cross-lingual alignment and includes sentence pairs from JW and GNOME. The citation is:
   > Tiedemann (2012). *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS*. In Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

In the **experiments section (5)**, the authors reiterate the use of the TATOEBA and BUCC datasets, confirming their relevance for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for proper referencing.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
