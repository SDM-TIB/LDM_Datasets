To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VGAI: End-to-End Learning of Vision-Based Decentralized Controllers for Robot Swarms" by Ting-Kuei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a learning framework for decentralized control based on visual inputs, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of decentralized control and the importance of visual observations, but again, no datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there is no specific section labeled "Datasets," but the **experiments** section describes the use of the Microsoft Airsim Simulation environment for rendering visual inputs. This suggests that the authors utilized a simulation dataset rather than a traditional dataset with labeled data.

I will also check the **implementation details** and **experimental results** sections for any references to datasets or data collection methods. The paper describes the simulation environment and the parameters used for training the controller, but it does not provide a formal dataset citation.

Since the paper primarily relies on a simulation environment (Microsoft Airsim), I will note that this environment serves as the dataset for the experiments. However, I need to provide a full citation for the Microsoft Airsim environment as it is a crucial component of the research.

The citation for the Microsoft Airsim environment is:
> Shital Shah, et al. *Microsoft AirSim: A Simulator for Drones, Cars and More*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2019.

In summary, I will compile the information as follows:

1. **Microsoft Airsim Simulation Environment**: This environment is used for rendering visual inputs for the agents in the experiments. It serves as the dataset for the study.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for the Microsoft Airsim environment, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant information from the paper.
