To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training on Dynamic Graph Neural Networks" by Ke-Jia Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comparative experiments on three realistic dynamic network datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **HepPh**: A citation network dataset in high energy physics phenomenology, covering papers from January 1993 to April 2003. It consists of 34,546 nodes and 421,578 directed edges.

2. **MathOverflow**: A temporal network of interactions on the Stack Exchange website Math Overflow, with 24,818 nodes and 239,978 directed edges. The dataset spans 2,350 days.

3. **SuperUser**: Another temporal network of interactions on the Stack Exchange website Super User, which has 194,095 nodes and 924,886 directed edges, covering a time span of 2,773 days.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it mentions that they were selected from the SNAP website. Therefore, I will reference the SNAP website as the source for these datasets.

The citation for the SNAP website is:
> SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project). Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and the citation for the source of the datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
