To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Trip Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Bike Sharing System Expansion" by Yuebing Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated using **multi-year BSS data from New York City**, which indicates that there is a dataset related to bike-sharing trips in NYC. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Citi Bike Data**: This dataset includes the start and end station and time of each trip over time, covering the period from July 2013 to December 2019. This dataset is crucial for understanding bike-sharing demand and is used for model evaluation.

2. **POI Data**: The authors mention that the POI data is obtained from NYC Open Data, consisting of 20,558 POI points from 13 facility categories. This dataset is used to extract built environment features.

3. **Socio-demographics Data**: This data comes from the NYC Population Factfinder, providing Decennial Census data for different census tracts in NYC.

4. **Road Network Data**: This dataset is downloaded from OpenStreetMap and includes information about the road network in NYC, which is used for feature extraction.

5. **Transportation Facilities Data**: This dataset includes the distribution of subway stations from NYC Open Data.

I will now compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **Citi Bike Data**, the citation is:
  > N/A (The dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation, but it is referenced as the Citi Bike system data available at https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

- For **POI Data**, the citation is:
  > NYC Open Data. *POI Data*. Available at: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

- For **Socio-demographics Data**, the citation is:
  > NYC Population Factfinder. *Decennial Census Data*. Available at: https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov/

- For **Road Network Data**, the citation is:
  > OpenStreetMap. *Road Network Data*. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org

- For **Transportation Facilities Data**, the citation is:
  > NYC Open Data. *Subway Stations Data*. Available at: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

After gathering all this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
