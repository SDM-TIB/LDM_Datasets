To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KS-GNNExplainer: Global Model Interpretation Through Instance Explanations On Histopathology images" by Sina Abdous et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of explainability in deep learning for histopathology images, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section**.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **BRACS**: This dataset is used for breast carcinoma subtyping in histology images. The authors reference it as a significant dataset for their experiments.

2. **BACH**: This dataset is part of a grand challenge on breast cancer histology images, which is also utilized in their experiments.

3. **BreCaHAD**: This dataset is specifically for breast cancer histopathological annotation and diagnosis, providing nuclei annotations.

4. **CRC**: The Colorectal Cancer Grading dataset is used to further examine the method proposed in the paper.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **BRACS**, the citation is:
  > Brancati, N., Anniciello, A.M., Pati, P., Riccio, D., Scognamiglio, G., Jaume, G., De Pietro, G., Di Bonito, M., Foncubierta, A., Botti, G., Gabrani, M., Feroce, F., Frucci, M. (2021). *BRACS: A dataset for breast carcinoma subtyping in H&E histology images*. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2111.04740.

- For **BACH**, the citation is:
  > Aresta, G., Araújo, T., Kwok, S., et al. (2019). *BACH: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images*. Medical Image Analysis, 56, 122–139. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2019.05.010.

- For **BreCaHAD**, the citation is:
  > Aksac, A., Demetrick, D.J., Ozyer, T., Alhajj, R. (2019). *BreCaHAD: A dataset for breast cancer histopathological annotation and diagnosis*. BMC Research Notes, 12(1), 1–3.

- For **CRC**, the citation is:
  > Awan, R., Sirinukunwattana, K., Epstein, D., et al. (2017). *Glandular morphometrics for objective grading of colorectal adenocarcinoma histology images*. Scientific Reports, 7(1), 16852. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16516-w.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
