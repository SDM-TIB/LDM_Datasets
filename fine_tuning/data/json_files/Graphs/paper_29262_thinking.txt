To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Contrastive Learning with Model Augmentation" by Zhiwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on three public datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **Amazon Sports Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing user interactions related to sports products. The authors provide specific statistics: it has 35,598 users, 18,357 items, and 296,337 interactions.

2. **Amazon Toys and Games Dataset**: Similar to the Sports dataset, this dataset includes user interactions but focuses on toys and games. It consists of 19,412 users, 11,924 items, and 167,597 interactions.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is used for business recommendations and contains 30,431 users, 20,033 items, and 316,354 interactions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Amazon Sports Dataset** and **Amazon Toys and Games Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In SIGIR, pp. 43â€“52, 2015.

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
