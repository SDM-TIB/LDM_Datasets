To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Predict Visual Attributes in the Wild" by Khoi Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "large-scale in-the-wild visual attribute prediction dataset" consisting of over 927K attribute annotations for over 260K object instances. This indicates that a specific dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Visual Attributes in the Wild (VAW) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the dataset as follows:

1. **VAW Dataset**: This dataset includes over 927K explicitly labeled positive and negative attribute annotations applied to over 260K object instances, with 620 unique attributes and 2,260 unique object categories. The dataset is designed to address challenges in attribute prediction, such as label sparsity and data imbalance.

The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of instances, attributes, and the distribution of positive and negative labels. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and significance.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VAW dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that highlight its importance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that the citation for the dataset is properly noted as part of the paper itself.

In conclusion, the primary dataset extracted from this research paper is the **VAW Dataset**, which is a significant contribution to the field of visual attribute prediction.
