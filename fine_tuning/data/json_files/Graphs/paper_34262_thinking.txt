To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fortify the Guardian, Not the Treasure: Resilient Adversarial Detectors" by Raz Lapid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on **CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets**, which suggests these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experimental framework section**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, containing over 600,000 labeled digits.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across 1,000 classes, but the authors mention they used a subset of ImageNet for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. URL: https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18268744.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Baolin Wu, Andrew Y Ng, et al. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, pp. 7. Granada, Spain, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
