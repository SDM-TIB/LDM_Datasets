To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strong Transitivity Relations and Graph Neural Networks" by Yassin Mohamadi and Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their model on. Here, they state that they used several real-world datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset consisting of 2,708 nodes (documents) and 10,556 edges (citations). Each document is represented by a bag-of-words feature vector with 1,433 features.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes and 9,104 edges. It has 3,703 features for each document.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,717 nodes and 88,648 edges, with 500 features per document.

4. **United States Air-traffic Network**: Compiled from transportation statistics, this dataset includes 1,190 nodes representing airports and 13,599 edges, with one-hot encoded node attributes.

5. **Twitch Social Network**: This dataset represents user interactions on Twitch, with 1,912 nodes and 64,510 edges. It includes attributes like preferred games and geographic location.

6. **Network of Actor Co-occurrences**: This dataset consists of 7,600 nodes (actors) and 30,019 edges, with attributes capturing keywords from Wikipedia entries.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Twitch Social Network**, the citation is:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2021). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. *Journal of Complex Networks*, 9(2), cnab014.

- For the **Network of Actor Co-occurrences**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
