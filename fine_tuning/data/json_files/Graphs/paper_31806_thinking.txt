To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Spatio-Temporal Graph Contrastive Learning" by Qianru Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments for three downstream spatio-temporal mining tasks on several real-world datasets," indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges in urban sensing scenarios and the need for effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks. They mention using datasets collected from Chicago and New York City, which suggests that these cities' datasets are relevant.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Chicago Crime Dataset**: This dataset includes various types of crimes (Theft, Battery, Assault, Damage) recorded over a year in Chicago.
2. **New York City Crime Dataset**: This dataset includes crime records (Burglary, Larceny, Robbery, Assault) for New York City over a similar time frame.
3. **Taxi Trip Datasets**: These datasets consist of taxi trips collected from both Chicago and New York City, detailing user mobility patterns.
4. **Point-of-Interest (POI) Datasets**: These datasets contain information about various POIs categorized into different types (e.g., restaurants, schools) in both cities.
5. **House Price Datasets**: These datasets provide information on house prices in both Chicago and New York City.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Chicago Crime Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chicago Police Department. *Chicago Crime Data*. Available at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/

- For the **New York City Crime Dataset**, the citation is:
  > New York City Police Department. *NYPD Crime Statistics*. Available at: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/

- For the **Taxi Trip Datasets**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Taxi Trip Records*. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

- For the **POI Datasets**, the citation is:
  > OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap Data*. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org/

- For the **House Price Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Zillow. *Real Estate Value in Chicago and New York City*. Available at: https://www.zillow.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
