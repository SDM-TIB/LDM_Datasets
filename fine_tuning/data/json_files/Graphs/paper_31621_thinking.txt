To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLCLSA: Cross-omics Linked embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention for multi-omics integration with incomplete multi-omics data" by Chen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on **four public multi-omics datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and comparison approaches)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ROSMAP dataset**: This dataset contains 351 subjects and is used for distinguishing Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) subjects from normal controls.

2. **LGG dataset**: This dataset is for low-grade glioma classification and contains 246 grade-2 subjects and 264 grade-3 subjects.

3. **BRCA dataset**: This dataset is used for breast invasive carcinoma PAM50 subtype classification and contains 876 subjects across 5 classes.

4. **KIPAN dataset**: This dataset is used for kidney cancer type classification and contains 658 subjects from 3 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ROSMAP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bennett, D. A., Schneider, J. A., Arvanitakis, Z., & Wilson, R. S. (2012). Overview and findings from the religious orders study. *Current Alzheimer Research*, 9(6), 628-645.

- For the **LGG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Network, C. G. A. R. (2015). Comprehensive, integrative genomic analysis of diffuse lower-grade gliomas. *New England Journal of Medicine*, 372(25), 2481-2498.

- For the **BRCA dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. (2013). The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project. *Nature Genetics*, 45(11), 1113-1120.

- For the **KIPAN dataset**, the citation is the same as for the BRCA dataset:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. (2013). The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project. *Nature Genetics*, 45(11), 1113-1120.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations accurately. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
