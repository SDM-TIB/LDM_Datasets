To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost Sensitive GNN-based Imbalanced Learning for Mobile Social Network Fraud Detection" by Xinxin Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two open-source real-world mobile network fraud datasets." This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly mention two datasets: **Sichuan** and **BUPT**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of users, the nature of the data, and the imbalance rates.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **Sichuan Dataset**: This dataset contains call detail record (CDR) data of 6,106 users from 23 cities in a large province of China, spanning from August 2019 to March 2020. The dataset includes features extracted from user behavior records, with a fraud ratio of 32.1%. The imbalance rate (IR) is reported as 0.4735.

2. **BUPT Dataset**: This dataset includes CDR data for one week from users in a Chinese city. It contains 116,383 nodes with a fraud ratio of 7.3%. The imbalance rate (IR) is reported as 0.0809.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For the **Sichuan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, X., Chen, H., Liu, S., Jiang, H., Chu, G., & Li, R. (2022). A bridge to graph machine learning in telecommunications fraud detection. *Future Generation Computer Systems*, 137, 274-287.

- For the **BUPT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, M., Liao, J., Wang, J., & Qi, Q. (2019). AGRM: Attention-based graph representation model for telecom fraud detection. In *ICC 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)* (pp. 1-6). IEEE.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
