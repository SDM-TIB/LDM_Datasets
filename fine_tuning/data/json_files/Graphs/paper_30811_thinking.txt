To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Visual Representations beyond Objects" by Songwei Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors pre-trained their model on **COCO** and **OpenImages** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets to note.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section**. In **section 3.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors explicitly mention that they pre-trained on three datasets: **COCO**, the full **OpenImages** dataset, and a subset of **OpenImages**. This confirms that these datasets are used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, M. Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. **OpenImages Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. In International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2020.

3. **Subset of OpenImages**: While the authors refer to a subset of OpenImages, they do not provide a specific citation for it. However, since it is derived from the OpenImages dataset, I will reference the same citation as above.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
