To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BHGNN-RT: Network embedding for directed heterogeneous graphs" by Xiyang Sun and Fumiyasu Komaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on various datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora**: A classic citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. It represents articles and their citations, with features described by bag-of-words vectors.
   
2. **Cora_ml**: Similar to Cora, this dataset has 2,995 nodes, 8,416 edges, and 7 classes, also representing articles and their citations.

3. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 4,715 edges, and 6 classes, featuring articles and their citations.

4. **CiteSeer_full**: An extended version of CiteSeer with 4,230 nodes, 5,358 edges, and 6 classes.

5. **Amazon_cs**: A co-purchase network dataset with 13,752 nodes, 287,209 edges, and 10 classes, representing goods and their co-purchases.

6. **Amazon_photo**: Another co-purchase dataset with 7,650 nodes, 143,663 edges, and 8 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora** and **Cora_ml**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Kachites McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > C Lee Giles, Kurt D Bollacker, and Steve Lawrence. *Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system*. In Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Digital libraries, pages 89–98, 1998.

- For **CiteSeer_full**, the citation is the same as for CiteSeer.

- For **Amazon_cs** and **Amazon_photo**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
