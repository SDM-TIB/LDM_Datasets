To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Abnormality Classification and Localization in Chest X-rays with Radiomics using a Feedback Loop" by Yan Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **NIH Chest X-ray dataset** for experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. In this section, they describe the **NIH Chest X-ray dataset** as containing **112,120 X-ray images** collected from **30,805 patients**, with a focus on the class imbalance present in the dataset. They also mention that the dataset includes **984 bounding boxes** for 8 types of chest diseases annotated by radiologists.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NIH Chest X-ray dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, and Ronald M Summers. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2097â€“2106, 2017.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed framework. It consists of 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 patients, with a significant class imbalance and includes 984 bounding boxes for 8 types of diseases.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
