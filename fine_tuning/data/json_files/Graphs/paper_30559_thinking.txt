To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point-Syn2Real: Semi-Supervised Synthetic-to-Real Cross-Domain Learning for Object Classification in 3D Point Clouds" by Ziwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called **Point-Syn2Real**, which is a strong signal that I should look for more details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Point-Syn2Real Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets they compiled. They mention that the Point-Syn2Real dataset includes both synthetic and real-world data for evaluating cross-domain learning methods. 

In this section, the authors describe the datasets used:

1. **ModelNet**: A dataset containing 3D CAD models used as the synthetic source domain for indoor object classification. The authors extracted ten overlapping categories from this dataset.
   
2. **ShapeNet**: Another dataset of 3D models that serves as a synthetic source domain alongside ModelNet for indoor settings.

3. **ScanNet**: A dataset of richly annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes, which serves as the real-world target domain for indoor object classification.

4. **3D City**: A synthetic dataset created from CAD models for outdoor settings, which serves as the synthetic source domain for outdoor object classification.

5. **SemanticKITTI**: A dataset containing real-world LiDAR scans used as the target domain for outdoor object classification.

The authors also provide a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the number of simulated scans and original models for each dataset, which further confirms the datasets' details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet**, the citation is:

- For **3D City**, the authors mention it as a subset created from CAD models, but do not provide a specific citation in the references.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
