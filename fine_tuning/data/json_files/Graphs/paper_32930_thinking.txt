To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Lung Ultrasound Videos" by Li Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a **multi-center dataset of over 27k lung ultrasound videos**. This suggests that a significant dataset is involved, and I should look for more details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly focusing on any specific descriptions of the dataset. In the methods section, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, stating that it consists of **27,063 lung ultrasound videos** acquired from **528 patients** across **8 clinical sites**. They also mention that the videos were collected between **2017 and 2020** and that **1,669 videos** were annotated for the presence or absence of lung consolidation.

I will also check the **tables** and **figures** for any additional dataset details. In **Table 1**, the dataset is summarized, providing key statistics such as the number of sites, patients, total videos, and the breakdown of labeled versus unlabeled videos.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a collection of videos from multiple clinical sites and does not appear to have a single authoritative citation, I will note that the dataset is derived from clinical data collected across various institutions.

The relevant details I have gathered about the dataset are as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Multi-center Lung Ultrasound Dataset
- **Description**: A retrospective dataset consisting of 27,063 lung ultrasound videos acquired from 528 patients with suspicion of lung consolidation or related pathology. The videos were collected from 8 U.S. clinical sites between 2017 and 2020. Out of these, 1,669 videos were annotated for the presence or absence of lung consolidation.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset does not have a specific citation, I will note that it is based on clinical data from multiple institutions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation details as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the dataset used in the research.
