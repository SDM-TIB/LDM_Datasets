To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-FFNN: A Two-Stream Deep Model for Learning Solution to Partial Differential Equations" by Onur Bilgin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this paper, the authors mention testing their model on various partial differential equations (PDEs), which suggests that they might have used specific datasets or generated data for these equations.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **numerical results section**. The authors discuss experiments on four PDEs: 1D-Burgers, 1D-Schrödinger, 2D-Burgers, and 2D-Schrödinger equations. I will note down any details about how the data was generated or sourced for these experiments.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors summarize their findings and may reiterate the datasets used, which can provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution for the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following information:

1. **1D-Burgers Dataset**: The dataset is generated from the 1D-Burgers equation, which is defined in the paper. The authors describe the domain and the number of nodes used for training and testing.

2. **1D-Schrödinger Dataset**: Similar to the Burgers dataset, this dataset is generated based on the 1D-Schrödinger equation, with specific details on the domain and node distribution.

3. **2D-Burgers Dataset**: This dataset is created for the 2D-Burgers equation, with the authors specifying the dimensions and the number of nodes.

4. **2D-Schrödinger Dataset**: The dataset for the 2D-Schrödinger equation is also generated, and the authors provide details on the domain and node configuration.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset, including any relevant papers or sources that describe the equations or methods used to generate the datasets.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
