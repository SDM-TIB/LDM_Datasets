To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Social Relation Inference with Concise Interaction Graph and Discriminative Scene Representation" by Xiaotian Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the collection of a "new large-scale dataset" consisting of about 240,000 unlabeled images, which indicates that there are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **PIPA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for evaluating social relation classification. The authors note that the accuracy over all classes is used to evaluate methods on this dataset.

2. **PISC Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as being used for experiments, with a hierarchy of social relations defined within it. The authors provide details about the evaluation metrics used for this dataset, such as per-class recalls and mean Average Precision (mAP).

Additionally, the authors introduce a new dataset called **PISC-extension**, which is an extension of the PISC dataset, created by using Google image search to find similar images. This dataset contains approximately 240,200 images and is used for contrastive learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **PIPA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, N., Paluri, M., Taigman, Y., Fergus, R., & Bourdev, L. (2015). Beyond frontal faces: Improving person recognition using multiple cues. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4804–4813.

- For the **PISC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, J., Wong, Y., Zhao, Q., & Kankanhalli, M. S. (2017). Dual-glance model for deciphering social relationships. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2650–2659.

- For the **PISC-extension Dataset**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is based on the PISC dataset and does not have a separate citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
