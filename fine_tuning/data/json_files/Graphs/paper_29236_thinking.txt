To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Representation Forgetting in Supervised and Unsupervised Continual Learning" by MohammadReza Davari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they used. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of continual learning benchmarks. Specifically, I will look for sections that explicitly list the datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

From my reading, I identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. It contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **MIT Scenes**: A dataset used for indoor scene classification, consisting of 5,360 samples across 67 classes.
3. **Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB)**: A dataset for bird species classification, containing 6,033 samples across 200 classes.
4. **Oxford Flowers**: A dataset for flower classification, which includes 2,040 samples across 102 classes.
5. **SplitCIFAR100**: A variant of the CIFAR-100 dataset, split into 10 tasks, each containing 10 classes.
6. **SplitCIFAR10**: Another variant of the CIFAR-10 dataset, split into 2 tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ImageNet**:

Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- **Oxford Flowers**: 
  > M-E. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, Dec 2008.

- **CIFAR-10**:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
