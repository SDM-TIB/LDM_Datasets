To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Prompt Caption for Video Grounding" by Hongxiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three public datasets**: ActivityNet Captions, TACoS, and ActivityNet-CG. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset contains 20,000 untrimmed videos and 100,000 descriptions from YouTube, covering a wide range of human behaviors. The authors note that the average length of the videos is around 2 minutes, with varying lengths for annotated clips.

2. **TACoS**: This dataset consists of 127 cooking scenario videos, averaging around 7 minutes each. The authors follow a standard split for training, validation, and testing, providing specific numbers of video-query pairs for each set.

3. **ActivityNet-CG**: This dataset is a new split of ActivityNet Captions, designed to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to novel compositions or words. The authors mention that it is divided into four sets: training, novel-composition, novel-word, and test-trivial.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ActivityNet Captions**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

- For **TACoS**, the citation is:
  > Michaela Regneri, Marcus Rohrbach, Dominikus Wetzel, Stefan Thater, Bernt Schiele, and Manfred Pinkal. *Grounding action descriptions in videos*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1:25–36, 2013.

- For **ActivityNet-CG**, the citation is:
  > Juncheng Li, Junlin Xie, Long Qian, Linchao Zhu, Siliang Tang, Fei Wu, Yi Yang, Yueting Zhuang, and Xin Eric Wang. *Compositional temporal grounding with structured variational cross-graph correspondence learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3032–3041, 2022.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
