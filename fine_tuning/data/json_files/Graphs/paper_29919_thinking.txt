To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConCL: Concept Contrastive Learning for Dense Prediction Pre-training in Pathology Images" by Jiawei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)** and **section 4 (Experiments)**, as these sections often detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 3, the authors mention using the **NCT-CRC-HE-100K dataset** for pre-training, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the type of images it contains.

In section 4, the authors discuss the datasets used for transferring experiments. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **GlaS Dataset**: This dataset is used for gland segmentation in pathology images and is described as containing images with object-instance-level annotations. I will extract the details about the dataset size and the nature of the annotations.

2. **CRAG Dataset**: This dataset is focused on colorectal adenocarcinoma glands and also includes object-instance-level annotations. I will gather information about the number of images and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **NCT-CRC-HE-100K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kather, J.N., Halama, N., Marx, A. (2018). *100,000 histological images of human colorectal cancer and healthy tissue*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1214456.

- For the **GlaS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sirinukunwattana, K., Pluim, J.P., Chen, H., et al. (2017). *Gland segmentation in colon histology images: The GlaS challenge contest*. Medical Image Analysis, 35, 489-502.

- For the **CRAG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graham, S., Chen, H., Gamper, J., et al. (2019). *Mild-net: Minimal information loss dilated network for gland instance segmentation in colon histology images*. Medical Image Analysis, 52, 199-211.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured and presented clearly.
