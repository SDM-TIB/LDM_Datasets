To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COË†3: Cooperative Unsupervised 3D Representation Learning for Autonomous Driving" by Runjian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **DAIR-V2X** for cooperative contrastive learning, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DAIR-V2X**: This dataset is described as the first real-world autonomous dataset for vehicle-infrastructure-cooperative detection tasks, containing 38,845 LiDAR frames.

2. **Once**: This dataset is noted for its large scale, with 1 million LiDAR frames and 15,000 fully annotated frames, used for evaluating self-supervised methods.

3. **KITTI**: A widely used dataset for self-driving applications, containing around 7,000 samples for training and evaluation.

4. **Waymo**: A large-scale dataset with over 200,000 frames of outdoor-scene point clouds.

5. **NuScenes**: This dataset contains approximately 1.4 million annotated 3D boxes, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I find are:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
