To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Low-pass Filtering: Graph Convolutional Networks with Automatic Filtering" by Zonghan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets for both node classification and graph prediction tasks.

For **node classification**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PUBMED**: A citation network consisting of 19,717 documents with 7 class labels. The feature of each document is a bag-of-words representation of dimension 500.

2. **SBM-PATTERN**: A synthesized graph dataset generated by the stochastic block model, with node features uniformly generated from a vocabulary of {1, 2, 3}.

3. **SBM-CLUSTER**: Another synthesized graph dataset generated by the stochastic block model, similar to SBM-PATTERN.

4. **Arxiv-year**: A dataset derived from the Arxiv papers, used for node classification.

5. **YelpChi**: A dataset from the Yelp platform, used for node classification.

6. **Squirrel**: A dataset used for node classification tasks.

For **graph prediction**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ZINC**: A molecular graph dataset where the task is to regress a molecular property called constrained solubility.

2. **MNIST**: An image classification dataset converted into a graph format.

3. **CIFAR10**: Another image classification dataset converted into a graph format.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.
