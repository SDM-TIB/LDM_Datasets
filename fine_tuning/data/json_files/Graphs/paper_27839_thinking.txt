To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shifting Transformation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection" by Sina Mohseni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several image datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction also emphasizes the importance of OOD detection in various applications, hinting that specific datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the experiments in detail. In this paper, the **Experiments and Results** section is crucial, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned.

Upon reviewing the **Experiments and Results** section, I find that the authors mention three primary datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 100 classes, with 600 images per class. This dataset is also commonly used in the field of computer vision.

3. **ImageNet-30**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, which includes 30 classes and is used for multi-class classification tasks.

In addition to these primary datasets, the authors also reference several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets used for testing the robustness of their model, including:

- **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.

- **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images and 50 validation images per class.

- **Places365**: A dataset for scene recognition, containing images from 365 different scene categories.

- **LSUN**: The Large-scale Scene Understanding dataset, which includes images of various scene categories.

- **Pets**: A dataset containing images of different breeds of cats and dogs.

- **Flowers-101**: A dataset consisting of images of 101 flower categories.

- **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset, which includes images of 200 bird species.

- **Dogs**: A dataset containing images of various dog breeds.

- **Food**: A dataset with images of different food items.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited for future reference.
