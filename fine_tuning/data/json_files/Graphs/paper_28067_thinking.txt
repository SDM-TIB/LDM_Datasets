To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-temporal graph neural networks for multi-site PV power forecasting" by Jelena Simeunović et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Real Dataset**: This dataset consists of records from 304 photovoltaic (PV) plants across Switzerland. The authors note that the plants are distributed in a way that reflects the population density of the country.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset includes simulated production data from 1000 PV plants. The authors explain that this dataset was generated using statistical models that match the real dataset's characteristics, such as location density and production time series, utilizing the PVlib python library and historical weather data from the HelioClim 3 database.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated or simulated based on existing models and data, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the relevant sources mentioned in the paper:

- For the **PVlib** library, the citation is:
  > J. Stein, W. Holmgren, J. Forbess, and C. Hansen. "PVlib: Open source photovoltaic performance modeling functions for MATLAB and Python." In Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE 43rd Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), pp. 3425–3430, 2016.

- For the **HelioClim 3 database**, the citation is:
  > HelioClim 3 database. Available: http://www.soda-pro.com/help/helioclim/helioclim-3-overview.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the relevant sources. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their authoritative references.
