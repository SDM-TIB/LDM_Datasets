To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-camera Torso Pose Estimation using Graph Neural Networks" by Daniel Rodriguez-Criado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a dataset generated from simulations and real data, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset Generation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the creation of a dataset that combines both simulated and real data. They specify that the final dataset contains over 20,000 samples, with 19,833 samples being simulated and 631 being real. This section is crucial as it outlines the composition and characteristics of the datasets.

The authors also mention that the dataset is provided in JSON format and is available in a public repository. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that can be cited.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they created, but they do reference the public repository where it can be accessed. The repository link is provided as:
> https://github.com/vangiel/WheresTheFellow

Since the dataset is a product of the authors' work, I will create a citation for it based on the paper's authors and title. The citation will be formatted as follows:

- **Dataset Citation**:
  > Daniel Rodriguez-Criado, Pilar Bachiller, Pablo Bustos, George Vogiatzis, and Luis J. Manso. *Multi-camera Torso Pose Estimation Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/vangiel/WheresTheFellow.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
