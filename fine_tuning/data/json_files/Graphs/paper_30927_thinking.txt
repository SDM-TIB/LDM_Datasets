To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning Reduces Hallucination in Conversations" by Weiwei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Wizard-of-Wikipedia**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in evaluating their proposed method, MixCL.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **Wizard-of-Wikipedia (WoW)** dataset, which is described as an open-domain, knowledge-grounded dialogue dataset consisting of 22,311 conversations over 1,365 general topics. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Dinan, E., Roller, S., Shuster, K., Fan, A., Auli, M., & Weston, J. (2019). Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-Powered Conversational agents. In ICLR.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset, I will ensure that I capture all relevant details about it, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
