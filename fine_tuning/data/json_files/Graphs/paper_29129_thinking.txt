To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Brain Tumor Segmentation via Missing Modality Synthesis and Modality-Level Attention Fusion" by Ziqi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **BraTS2020 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. Here, the authors explicitly state that the **BraTS2020 dataset** contains paired MR images of T1, T2, T1ce, and FLAIR from a total of 369 glioma patients. This confirms that the BraTS2020 dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they utilize the BraTS2020 dataset for training their model, indicating that T1, T2, and FLAIR are the available modalities while T1ce is the missing target modality. This further solidifies the importance of the BraTS2020 dataset in their study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the BraTS2020 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> B. H. Menze, A. Jakab, S. Bauer et al., “The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats),” IEEE transactions on medical imaging, vol. 34, no. 10, pp. 1993–2024, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details:

1. **BraTS2020 Dataset**: This dataset includes paired MR images of T1, T2, T1ce, and FLAIR from 369 glioma patients, which are used for training the model. The dataset is crucial for the tasks of modality synthesis and tumor segmentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
