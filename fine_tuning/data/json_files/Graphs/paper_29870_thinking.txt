To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMGL: Multi-Scale Multi-View Global-Local Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Cardiac Image Segmentation" by Ziyuan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MM-WHS dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention that they evaluated their framework on the **Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge 2017 (MM-WHS) dataset**, which consists of 20 cardiac CT volumes and expert labels for 7 cardiac structures. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MM-WHS dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the challenge it comes from. Therefore, I will cite the challenge as follows:

- For the **MM-WHS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziyuan Zhao, Zeng Zeng, Kaixin Xu, Cen Chen, and Cuntai Guan. *Dsal: Deeply supervised active learning from strong and weak labelers for biomedical image segmentation*. IEEE J. Biomed. Health Inform., 2021.

Since the dataset is part of a challenge, I will also include the challenge's citation if available. However, in this case, the authors did not provide a specific reference for the MM-WHS dataset in the references section.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MM-WHS dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
