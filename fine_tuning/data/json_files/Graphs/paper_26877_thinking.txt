To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Propagation Using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Martin Klissarov and Doina Precup, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often outline the context of their research and may reference specific datasets or benchmarks. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments that are used in their experiments.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups.

In this paper, the authors mention several environments and benchmarks, including:

1. **MiniWorld**: A simulator used for various navigation tasks. The authors reference specific tasks within this environment, such as MiniWorld-FourRooms-v0 and MiniWorld-MyWayHome-v0.

2. **Atari 2600**: The authors mention conducting experiments on 20 different Atari games, which are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

3. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control, which is also referenced as a benchmark for continuous control tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, I will look for citations related to:

- **MiniWorld**: The citation for the MiniWorld environment is:
  > Chevalier-Boisvert, M. (2018). *gym-miniworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-miniworld.

- **Atari 2600**: The Atari benchmark is often referenced in various papers, but I will ensure to find the specific citation used in this context.

- **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 5026-5033.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
