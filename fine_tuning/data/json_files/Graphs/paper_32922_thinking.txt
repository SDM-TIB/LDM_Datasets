To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Physical Causality from Measurements to Detect and Localize False Data Injection Attacks" by Shengyang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention that the performance of their framework is evaluated on the **IEEE 39-bus system**. This indicates that the dataset used for the experiments is related to this specific power system.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. The authors describe that they performed a total of **16,500 time-domain simulations** using PSCAD/EMTDC, which suggests that the dataset consists of simulated measurements from the power system under various conditions, including scenarios with and without False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IEEE 39-bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems research, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation for it. 

The citation for the IEEE 39-bus system is:
> "IEEE Reliability Test System," IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2003.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset generated from the simulations is not typically cited in the same way as established datasets, but I will mention that it was created using real-world data from NYISO and generated through Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset identified in the paper. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
