To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodes Discovery Recommendation with Multi-Source Augmentations" by Ziwei Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a real-world podcast recommendation dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of the dataset's name or details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss dataset statistics and preprocessing. Here, they provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset is collected from a large audio streaming platform and includes statistics such as the number of users, episodes, and interactions. 

In **Table 1**, the authors present the dataset statistics after preprocessing, which includes:
- **#users**: 65,756 (Train), 8,230 (Validation), 8,248 (Test)
- **#episodes**: 78,103 (Train), 17,381 (Validation), 17,758 (Test)
- **#interactions**: 77,003 (Train), 9,642 (Validation), 9,551 (Test)

This information confirms that the dataset is indeed a real-world podcast recommendation dataset, but the specific name of the dataset is not provided in the text.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on data collected from a large audio streaming platform. 

Since the dataset is not named in the references, I will document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Podcast Recommendation Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset collected from a large audio streaming platform, containing user interactions with podcast episodes, including user demographics and episode features.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself, as it is important to reference the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
