To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision Making For Celebrity Branding: An Opinion Mining Approach Based On Polarity And Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Consumer-Generated Content (CGC)" by Ali Nikseresht et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes consumer tweets from brand and influencer pages, which suggests that there is a dataset of tweets being analyzed.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe their data collection process, stating that they gathered tweets from five companies (Nike, Coca Cola, Burger King, Pepsi, and Gillette) and two celebrities associated with each brand. This indicates that the dataset consists of tweets related to these brands and celebrities.

In the **results section**, the authors provide tables summarizing the sentiment scores for each brand and celebrity, which further confirms the existence of a structured dataset derived from the tweets.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Twitter Consumer-Generated Content (CGC) Dataset**: This dataset includes tweets collected from the official Twitter accounts of five brands (Nike, Coca Cola, Burger King, Pepsi, and Gillette) and two celebrities associated with each brand. The total number of tweets before cleansing was 10,000 per brand and celebrity, with varying numbers after cleansing.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Results**: The paper presents sentiment scores for each brand and celebrity based on the analysis of the tweets, indicating the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis methods employed.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Twitter and the authors do not cite any specific external datasets, I will note that the dataset is based on original data collected from Twitter.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations as follows:

- **Twitter Consumer-Generated Content (CGC) Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset of tweets collected from the official Twitter accounts of five brands (Nike, Coca Cola, Burger King, Pepsi, and Gillette) and two celebrities associated with each brand. The dataset was used for sentiment analysis.
  - Citation: Nikseresht, A., Raeisi, M. H., & Abbasian Mohammadi, H. (2021). Decision Making For Celebrity Branding: An Opinion Mining Approach Based On Polarity And Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Consumer-Generated Content (CGC). 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
