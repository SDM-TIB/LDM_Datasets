To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASFlow: Unsupervised Optical Flow Learning with Adaptive Pyramid Sampling" by Kunming Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method achieves the best performance on multiple leading benchmarks, specifically naming **MPI-Sintel**, **KITTI 2012**, and **KITTI 2015**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **MPI-Sintel**: This dataset is described as containing 1,041 training image pairs extracted from a rendered open-source movie, divided into 'Clean' and 'Final' passes.

2. **KITTI 2012**: The authors refer to this dataset as containing 28,058 image pairs from the KITTI raw dataset, which is commonly used for optical flow evaluation.

3. **KITTI 2015**: Similar to KITTI 2012, this dataset is also derived from the KITTI raw dataset and is used for evaluating optical flow methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MPI-Sintel**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Butler, Jonas Wulff, Garrett Stanley, and Michael Black. *A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 611–625, 2012.

- For **KITTI 2012**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For **KITTI 2015**, the citation is:
  > Moritz Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3061–3070, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
