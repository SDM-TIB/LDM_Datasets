To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Data-Centric Properties for Graph Contrastive Learning" by Puja Trivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Verification)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention evaluating their methods on several benchmark datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about them.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset for binary classification of social networks.
2. **REDDIT-BINARY**: Another binary classification dataset based on Reddit posts.
3. **MUTAG**: A dataset for molecular graphs, specifically for the task of predicting mutagenicity.
4. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein classification based on graph representations.
5. **DD**: A dataset for graph classification tasks.
6. **NCI1**: A dataset used for molecular graph classification.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- **IMDB-BINARY**: 
  > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- **REDDIT-BINARY**: 
  > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- **MUTAG**: 
  > Debnath, A., Ghosh, A., & Dutta, A. (1991). Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic amines. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences.

- **PROTEINS**: 
  > Borgwardt, K. M., & Kriegel, H. P. (2005). Shortest-path kernels on graphs. In Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM).

- **DD**: 
  > Dobson, P. D., & Doig, A. J. (2003). Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments. Journal of Molecular Biology.

- **NCI1**: 
  > Wale, N., & Karypis, G. (2006). Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM).

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset.
