To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dubbing in Practice: A Large Scale Study of Human Localization With Insights for Automatic Dubbing" by William Brannon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a novel corpus of **319.57 hours of video from 54 professionally produced titles**, which suggests a dataset is present.

Next, I will examine the **Corpus Description & Preprocessing** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe a dataset consisting of every TV show produced by Amazon Studios available on Prime Video at the end of 2021, which includes:

1. **Amazon Studios Dubbing Dataset**: This dataset contains **674 episodes of 54 shows**, comprising **319.57 hours of content** from **9,215 distinct speakers**. It includes both original English audio and professionally produced Spanish and German dubs, along with transcripts and dubbing scripts.

In the **Analysis** section, the authors discuss various aspects of the dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they analyze the existing dataset in terms of isochrony, isometry, speaking rates, lip sync, and translation quality.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from proprietary content (Amazon Studios), there may not be a formal citation like those found for publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on Amazon Studios' productions and provide a description of its contents.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> William Brannon, Yogesh Virkar, and Brian Thompson. *Dubbing in Practice: A Large Scale Study of Human Localization With Insights for Automatic Dubbing*. MIT Media Lab and AWS AI Labs.

Since the dataset is proprietary and not formally published, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Amazon Studios Dubbing Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 674 episodes from 54 shows produced by Amazon Studios, totaling 319.57 hours of content, including original English audio and Spanish and German dubs, along with transcripts and dubbing scripts.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and the citation for the paper.
