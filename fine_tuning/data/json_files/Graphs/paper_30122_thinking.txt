To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spiral Contrastive Learning: An Efficient 3D Representation Learning Method for Unannotated CT Lesions" by Penghua Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three lung CT datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look specifically at the **experiments section**, particularly section IV, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **LIDC-IDRI**: This dataset is described as containing 1,018 CT scans for lung nodule diagnosis, with detailed annotations regarding the malignancy of nodules evaluated by radiologists.

2. **LNDb**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 294 CT scans, with annotations similar to those in LIDC-IDRI, processed to evaluate the malignancy of nodules.

3. **TianChi**: This dataset consists of 1,470 CT scans with annotations for four different lung diseases, highlighting the complexity and variety of the data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **LIDC-IDRI**, the citation is:
  > Armato III, S. G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M. F., Meyer, C. R., Reeves, A. P., Zhao, B., Aberle, D. R., Henschke, C. I., Hoffman, E. A., et al. (2011). The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): A completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans. *Medical Physics*, 38(2), 915-931.

- For **LNDb**, the citation is:
  > Pedrosa, J., Aresta, G., Ferreira, C., Rodrigues, M., Leitão, P., Carvalho, A. S., Rebelo, J., Negrão, E., Ramos, I., Cunha, A., et al. (2019). Lndb: A lung nodule database on computed tomography. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08434*.

- For **TianChi**, the citation is:
  > TianChi. (n.d.). Lung disease diagnosis dataset. Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231724/information?lang=en-us.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
