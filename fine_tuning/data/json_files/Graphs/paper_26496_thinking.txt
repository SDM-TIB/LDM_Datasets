To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SceneCAD: Predicting Object Alignments and Layouts in RGB-D Scans" by Armen Avetisyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on **ScanNet** and **SUNCG**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the use of a new dataset consisting of **1151 CAD layout annotations** on top of the **ScanNet RGB-D dataset**. This suggests that the authors have created a new dataset derived from an existing one, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **Object+Layout Dataset section (4)**, the authors provide detailed information about the new dataset they introduced. They describe the dataset as containing **1151 CAD layout annotations** that are associated with the **ScanNet dataset**. This section also outlines the semi-automated annotation process used to create this dataset, which is important for understanding its context and usage.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. **ScanNet Dataset**:

2. **SUNCG Dataset**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
