To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATM: Action Temporality Modeling for Video Question Answering" by Junwen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on multiple VideoQA datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **NExT-QA**: This dataset consists of 47.7K questions with answers in multiple-choice format, annotated from 5.4K videos. It is designed to assess causal and temporal reasoning over object interactions.

2. **TGIF-QA**: This dataset contains 134.7K questions related to repeated actions and state transitions, annotated from 91.8K GIFs.

3. **MSRVTT-QA**: This dataset includes 10K annotated videos and 244K open-ended question-answer pairs, focusing on holistic visual recognition or description.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NExT-QA**, the citation is:
  > Junbin Xiao, Xindi Shang, Angela Yao, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Next-QA: Next phase of question-answering to explaining temporal actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9777–9786, 2021.

- For **TGIF-QA**, the citation is:
  > Yunseok Jang, Yale Song, Youngjae Yu, Youngjin Kim, and Gunhee Kim. *TGIF-QA: Toward spatio-temporal reasoning in visual question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2758–2766, 2017.

- For **MSRVTT-QA**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In CVPR, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
