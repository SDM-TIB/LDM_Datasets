To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel-Wise Contrastive Learning for Learning with Noisy Labels" by Hui Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each with a size of 32×32 pixels and 10 classes. The original labels are clean.
   
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it has 100 classes. The original labels are clean as well.

3. **Animal-10N**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 5,000 test images, each with a size of 64×64 pixels, containing 10 animal classes. The estimated noise rate is around 8%.

4. **Clothing-1M**: This dataset is much larger, with 1 million training images and 10,000 test images across 14 classes. The estimated noise level is around 40%.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Animal-10N**, the citation is:
  > Hwanjun Song, Minseok Kim, and Jae-Gil Lee. *Selfie: Refurbishing unclean samples for robust deep learning*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5907–5915. PMLR, 2019.

- For **Clothing-1M**, the citation is:
  > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2691–2699, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
