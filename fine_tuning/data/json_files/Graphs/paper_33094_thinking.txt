To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optical Quantum Sensing for Agnostic Environments via Deep Learning" by Zeqiao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors. For instance, if the authors describe the datasets in terms of the number of samples, types of measurements, or specific parameters used, I will document these details.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to reference the datasets in their own work.
