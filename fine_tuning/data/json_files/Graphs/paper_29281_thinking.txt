To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADAGRID: Adaptive Grid Search for Link Prediction Training Objective" by Tim Poštuvan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further discusses the context of link prediction and mentions the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, I find that the datasets are described in **Section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors mention using the **Cora** and **CiteSeer** datasets.

1. **Cora Dataset**: The authors describe the Cora dataset as consisting of 2,708 scientific publications and 5,429 citation links, with each publication belonging to one of seven classes and represented by a binary-valued word vector.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: The CiteSeer dataset is described as containing 3,312 scientific publications and 4,732 citation links, with each publication belonging to one of six classes and also represented by a binary-valued word vector.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are provided in **Appendix A** of the paper:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Sen, Galileo Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Mag., 29:93–106, 2008.

- For the **CiteSeer Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Cora dataset since both datasets are referenced from the same source:
  > P. Sen, Galileo Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Mag., 29:93–106, 2008.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:
- **Cora Dataset**: Description and citation.
- **CiteSeer Dataset**: Description and citation.

I will now compile this information into the appropriate format for further use.
