To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Perception-Action-Communication Loops with Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks" by Ting-Kuei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Microsoft AirSim simulation environment** for their experiments, which suggests that they may have used synthetic datasets generated within this environment. I will check for any specific datasets or configurations mentioned in the experimental setup.

I will also review the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation in a consistent format, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
