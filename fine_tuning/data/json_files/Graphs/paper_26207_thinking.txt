To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spam Review Detection with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Ao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges faced by the anti-spam system at Xianyu, which suggests that there may be datasets related to spam comments and user interactions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors constructed a heterogeneous graph with a total of **37,323,039 comments** published by **9,158,512 users** on **25,107,228 items**. They also mention collecting **1,725,438 regular comments** and **74,213 spam comments** marked by human experts. This indicates that the dataset is quite large and specifically tailored for spam detection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is primarily derived from the Xianyu platform, and the authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself. Instead, they describe the dataset's characteristics and the context in which it was collected.

Since the dataset is unique to the study and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Xianyu Dataset**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 37,323,039 comments from 9,158,512 users on 25,107,228 items, including 1,725,438 regular comments and 74,213 spam comments marked by human experts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Although this dataset does not have a traditional citation, I will note it as part of the study's findings.
