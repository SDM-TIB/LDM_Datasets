To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction from Texts by Molecular Structure Information" by Masaki Asada, Makoto Miwa, and Yutaka Sasaki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors reference several drug databases, including **DrugBank**, **Therapeutic Target Database**, and **PharmGKB**. I will need to confirm if these databases are used as datasets in their experiments.

In **section 3 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors specifically mention the **DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set** and provide details about its composition, which includes documents annotated with drug mentions and interaction types. This section confirms that this dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention that they extracted **255,229 interacting pairs from DrugBank** for their molecular structure-based classification. This indicates that DrugBank is another dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DDIExtraction 2013 shared task data set**, the citation is:
   > Isabel Segura Bedmar, Paloma Martínez, and María Herrero Zazo. *SemEval-2013 Task 9: Extraction of drug-drug interactions from biomedical texts (DDIExtraction 2013)*. In Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations, pages 341–350, 2013.

2. For the **DrugBank**, the citation is:
   > Vivian Law, Craig Knox, Yannick Djoumbou, Tim Jewison, An Chi Guo, Yifeng Liu, Adam Maciejewski, David Arndt, Michael Wilson, Vanessa Neveu, et al. *DrugBank 4.0: shedding new light on drug metabolism*. Nucleic Acids Research, 42(D1):D1091–D1097, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
