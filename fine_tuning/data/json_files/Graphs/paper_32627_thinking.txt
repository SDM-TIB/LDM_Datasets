To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Federated Learning in 6G: A Trusted Architecture with Graph-based Analysis" by Wenxuan Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and the components of their architecture, but I need to identify if they reference any datasets used for training or testing their models.

In the **simulation and evaluation section**, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training and testing their federated learning models. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the dataset's role in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1988.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted dataset information is clear and ready for any further processing or review, maintaining the importance of including full citations for proper attribution.
