To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlation-aware active learning for surgery video segmentation" by Fei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on "two video datasets of surgical instruments and three real-world video datasets." This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **MONARCH Dataset**: This dataset is created using the MONARCHâ„¢ Platform and focuses on the biopsy phase of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy procedures. It consists of 11 videos with segmentation masks for various biopsy tools, totaling 2883 frames. The authors note that segments without visible tools were excluded.

2. **EndoVis Dataset**: This dataset is from the EndoVis 2018 Robotic Scene Segmentation challenge, containing 19 videos with segmentation masks for surgical tools and human body organs. The dataset is divided into 15 training videos and 4 test videos.

3. **A2D2 Dataset**: A large-scale driving dataset that includes 41,277 annotated images from various urban settings. The authors mention extracting 60 video segments from this dataset for their experiments.

4. **YouTube-VOS Dataset**: This is a large video segmentation dataset with over 5000 videos. The authors specifically selected videos showing skateboarders and parrots to create two binary segmentation datasets.

5. **Skateboard Dataset**: A subset of the YouTube-VOS dataset containing 24 training videos and 10 testing videos.

6. **Parrot Dataset**: Another subset of the YouTube-VOS dataset, consisting of 46 training videos and 10 testing videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MONARCH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, F., Marquez-Neila, P., Zheng, M., Rafii-Tari, H., & Sznitman, R. (2023). Correlation-aware active learning for surgery video segmentation. *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.

- For the **EndoVis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Kondo, S., Bodenstedt, S., et al. (2018). 2018 robotic scene segmentation challenge. *CoRR*, abs/2001.11190.

- For the **A2D2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geyer, J., Kassahun, Y., Mahmudi, M., et al. (2020). A2D2: Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset. *CoRR*, abs/2004.05280.

- For the **YouTube-VOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, N., Yang, L., Fan, Y., et al. (2018). YouTube-VOS: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark. *CoRR*, abs/1809.03327.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
