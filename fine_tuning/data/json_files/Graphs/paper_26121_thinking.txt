To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Structural Graph Classification" by Younjoo Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the empirical evaluation is conducted on **9 benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that lists or describes the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **Experiments section**. They state that they use **5 bioinformatics datasets** and **4 social network datasets**. 

I will list the datasets as follows:

1. **Bioinformatics Datasets**:
   - **MUTAG**: A dataset for the classification of chemical compounds.
   - **ENZYMES**: A dataset for enzyme classification.
   - **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein classification.
   - **DD**: A dataset for graph classification of drug-like compounds.
   - **NCI1**: A dataset from the National Cancer Institute for chemical compound classification.

2. **Social Network Datasets**:
   - **IMDB-B (Binary)**: A dataset for binary classification of social networks.
   - **IMDB-M (Multi)**: A dataset for multi-class classification of social networks.
   - **COLLAB**: A dataset for collaboration networks.
   - **REDDIT-B (Binary)**: A dataset for binary classification of Reddit posts.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets can be downloaded from a specific URL, which is:
> https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets

However, the paper does not provide individual citations for each dataset. Instead, it refers to the collection of datasets available at the provided link.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names along with their descriptions and the source URL for citation purposes.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are clear and accessible.
