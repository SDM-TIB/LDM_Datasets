To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metaheuristic conditional neural network for harvesting skyrmionic metastable states" by Qichen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used in previous studies or their own work. I will take note of any datasets that are referenced.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the data collection process, the specific datasets employed, and any relevant parameters. If the authors mention using a specific dataset for their simulations or analyses, I will document it.

The **results section** may also contain references to datasets, especially if the authors present data derived from specific datasets or compare results across different datasets. I will ensure to capture any relevant information here.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system**: This dataset is used for modeling the spin textures and is derived from density functional theory calculations. I will need to find the original source or citation for this dataset.

2. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: This model is used for identifying spin textures. I will look for the original paper or source that describes this model to provide a proper citation.

3. **UppASD package**: This software is mentioned for performing atomistic spin dynamics simulations. I will find the relevant citation for this package.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are formatted correctly and include all relevant details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have all the citations, I will summarize the datasets in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is properly attributed to its source.
