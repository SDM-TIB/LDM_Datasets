To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Tensor Factorization for Node Classification in Complex Social Networks" by Georgios Katsimpras and Georgios Paliouras, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its application, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing multi-relational networks and mention the use of a real-world dataset collected from Tagged.com for their experiments. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved, but I need to find its details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe the dataset used for evaluation. They mention that the dataset consists of 5,617,345 users interacting in seven different ways, specifically for spammer detection. They also note that the dataset is highly sparse, with an average density of less than 0.002%. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides some context about its structure.

The authors cite the dataset as being collected from Tagged.com and reference a paper by Fakhraei et al. (2015) for further details. I will need to retrieve the full citation for this dataset from the **References section**.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Shobeir Fakhraei, James Foulds, Madhusudana Shashanka, and Lise Getoor. *Collective spammer detection in evolving multi-relational social networks*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1769–1778, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Tagged.com Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset for spammer detection consisting of 5,617,345 users with interactions in seven different ways. The dataset is highly sparse, with an average density of less than 0.002%.
   - **Citation**: Shobeir Fakhraei, James Foulds, Madhusudana Shashanka, and Lise Getoor. *Collective spammer detection in evolving multi-relational social networks*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1769–1778, 2015.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
