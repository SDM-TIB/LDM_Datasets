To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the Computation and Communication Abstraction Barrier in Distributed Machine Learning Workloads" by Abhinav Jangda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets used in their experiments, I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of **BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3** models, which implies that datasets related to these models may be involved. I will check if they mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation, such as the datasets used for training BERT or the datasets used in the context of GPT-2 and GPT-3.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **BERT dataset**, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset and provide the full citation. Similarly, I will do the same for any datasets related to GPT-2 and GPT-3.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and properly attributed.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and well-organized.
