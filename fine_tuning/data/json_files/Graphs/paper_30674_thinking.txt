To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "FALSE: False Negative Samples Aware Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image" by Zhaoyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three RSI semantic segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors discuss the datasets used. In the section labeled **III. Experimental**, they mention three datasets:

1. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a public RSI semantic segmentation dataset. The authors note that it has a spatial resolution of 0.05m and includes 6 classes.

2. **CVPR DGLC Dataset**: This dataset is described as a competition dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5m and includes 7 classes.

3. **Xiangtan Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Gaofen-2 satellite covering Xiangtan, China, with a spatial resolution of 2m and includes 8 classes.

The authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table I**, which includes the spatial resolution and the number of classes for each dataset. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Rottensteiner, G. Sohn, J. Jung, M. Gerke, C. Baillard, S. Benitez, and U. Breitkopf. "The ISPRS benchmark on urban object classification and 3D building reconstruction."

- For the **CVPR DGLC Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Xiangtan Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as being derived from the Gaofen-2 satellite data.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
