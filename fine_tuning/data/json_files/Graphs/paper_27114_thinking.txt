To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Unseen Complex Scenes: Are We There Yet?" by Arantxa Casanova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and analysis sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **COCO-Stuff** as a dataset for evaluating complex scene conditional generation models, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **COCO-Stuff dataset** in detail, including its size and the splits used for training and evaluation. The authors state that the training set consists of **75,000 images** and the evaluation set consists of **3,000 images**, which confirms the dataset's significance in their analysis.

In addition, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO-Stuff dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018 IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the dataset used in the research.
