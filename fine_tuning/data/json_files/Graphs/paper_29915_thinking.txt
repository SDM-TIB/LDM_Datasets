To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiview Contrastive Learning for Completely Blind Video Quality Assessment of User Generated Content" by Shankhanil Mitra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on multiple camera-captured VQA datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **method** section, particularly in **section 3.2 (Data Generation)**, the authors mention using several existing datasets for training their model. They specifically list:

1. **LIVE Mobile**: A dataset containing videos with various synthetic distortions.
2. **LIVE VQA**: Another dataset with videos suffering from compression artifacts and transmission distortions.
3. **EPFL-PoliMI**: A dataset composed of videos encoded with H.264/AVC.
4. **CSIQ VQD**: This dataset includes videos subjected to various compression methods.
5. **ECVQ and EVVQ**: Datasets that include videos with H.264 and MPEG-4 visual compression.
6. **LIVE-FB Large-Scale Social Video Quality (LSVQ)**: This dataset is used for training with authentically distorted videos.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on four user-generated content datasets:

1. **KoNViD-1K**: A dataset containing 1200 videos filtered from the YFCC100m database.
2. **LIVE Video Quality Challenge (LVQC)**: A dataset consisting of 585 videos captured from various devices.
3. **LIVE Qualcomm Database (LQCOMM)**: This dataset includes 208 videos with distortions from mobile devices.
4. **YouTube-UGC**: A dataset containing 1380 user-generated videos across various categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned.
