To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-View Pre-Trained Model for Code Vulnerability Identification" by Xuxiang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors state that their experiments were conducted on **two public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 3.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention that they evaluated their approach on two C-language datasets collected from open-source projects: **FFmpeg** and **QEMU**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, including the number of functions, training, validation, and test sets, as well as the average length of the code snippets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from open-source projects, they may not have formal citations like academic papers. Instead, I will note the relevant projects:

1. **FFmpeg**: A widely used open-source multimedia framework. The citation for FFmpeg can be referenced as:
   > FFmpeg Developers. *FFmpeg*. Available at: https://ffmpeg.org/

2. **QEMU**: An open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. The citation for QEMU can be referenced as:
   > QEMU Developers. *QEMU*. Available at: https://www.qemu.org/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
