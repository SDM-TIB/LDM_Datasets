To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Network Representation for GNN-based Intrusion Detection" by Hamdi Friji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the problem being addressed.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for high-quality datasets for training machine learning models in intrusion detection. This indicates that datasets are crucial to their research, prompting me to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Pre-processing Phase)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **CICIDS 2017 dataset**: This dataset is described as a labeled network flows dataset that includes various common network attacks. It was created by capturing five days of network stream and is available in both flow-based and full packet versions.

2. **ToN IoT dataset**: This dataset is noted for its heterogeneous nature and includes realistic attack scenarios such as scanning, DoS, ransomware, and backdoor attacks. It was released by the Intelligent Security Group at UNSW Canberra.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CICIDS 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alsaedi, A., Moustafa, N., Tari, Z., Mahmood, A., Anwar, A. (2020). *TON IoT Telemetry Dataset: A New Generation Dataset of IoT and IIoT for Data-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems*. IEEE Access, 8. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022862

- For the **ToN IoT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alsaedi, A., Moustafa, N., Tari, Z., Mahmood, A., Anwar, A. (2020). *TON IoT Telemetry Dataset: A New Generation Dataset of IoT and IIoT for Data-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems*. IEEE Access, 8. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022862

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
