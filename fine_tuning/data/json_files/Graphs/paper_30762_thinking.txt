To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hand Guided High Resolution Feature Enhancement for Fine-Grained Atomic Action Segmentation within Complex Human Assemblies" by Nick Wright et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a novel action segmentation dataset containing 24 atomic actions from video data of a real-world robotics assembly production line. This suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention the creation of a novel assembly dataset collected from a real-world robotics assembly procedure, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Results)**, the authors provide details about the dataset they created. They describe it as containing video footage of 38 full assemblies recorded over three days, with a total of approximately 6 hours of footage. They also mention the labeling process and the types of actions included in the dataset.

I will summarize the key details of the dataset:
- **Novel Assembly Dataset**: This dataset includes 24 atomic actions related to a robotics assembly process, with a total of 186,632 labeled frames from approximately 324,000 frames. The dataset captures various interactions between the worker and the tools or components used in the assembly.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since this dataset is novel and created by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. However, I will note that the dataset is described in detail in the paper, and I will provide a citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Nick Wright, A. Stephen McGough, Nicholas Martin, Matthew Kent Myers. *Hand Guided High Resolution Feature Enhancement for Fine-Grained Atomic Action Segmentation within Complex Human Assemblies*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the dataset is novel and specific to this research, I will include the citation for the paper as the authoritative source for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details and the citation into a structured format for further processing.
