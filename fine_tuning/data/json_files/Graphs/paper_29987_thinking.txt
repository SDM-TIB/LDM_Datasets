To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSIVD-Net: A Novel Salient Super Image Classification & Detection Technique for Weaponized Violence" by Toluwani Aremu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract introduces the **Smart-City CCTV Violence Detection (SCVD)** dataset, which is specifically designed for learning weapon distribution in surveillance videos. This indicates that the dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Proposed Smart-City CCTV Violence Detection (SCVD) Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the SCVD dataset. They explain that this dataset contains distinctive videos of weaponized and non-weaponized violence scenarios captured from CCTV surveillance systems. The authors also mention that the dataset was created by downloading videos from YouTube, ensuring a diverse geographical representation.

In this section, I will note the key characteristics of the SCVD dataset:
- It includes videos of weaponized violence, non-weaponized violence, and normal violence.
- The dataset consists of around 500 videos, each trimmed to 5-10 seconds and annotated at the video level.

The authors also compare the SCVD dataset with other existing datasets in a table, highlighting its unique focus on weaponized violence in CCTV footage. However, they do not provide full citations for these other datasets in the main text, so I will need to refer to the **References section** to gather the necessary citations.

In the **References section**, I will look for the datasets mentioned in the comparison table, such as:
1. **NTU CCTV-Fights**: I will find the citation for this dataset.
2. **Hockey Fight**: I will locate the citation for this dataset as well.
3. **Real-Life Violent Situations (RLVS)**: I will check for its citation.
4. **RWF-2000**: I will find the citation for this dataset.
5. **Sohas**: I will look for its citation.
6. **Weapon Violence Dataset (WVD)**: I will also find its citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details along with their full citations. The SCVD dataset will be described in detail, while the other datasets will be listed with their citations.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is clearly organized and ready for presentation or further processing.
