To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M3PT: A Multi-Modal Model for POI Tagging" by Jingsong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors constructed two high-quality POI tagging datasets from a real-world business scenario, which indicates that datasets are present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets in **section 5 (Experiments)**, specifically under **5.1 Dataset Construction**.

The two datasets mentioned are:

1. **MPTD1 (Multi-modal POI Tagging Dataset)**: This dataset includes over 63,000 POIs, 354 unique tags, and more than 197,000 POI-tag pairs. It consists of textual contexts (such as names, introductions, categories, and user comments) and images related to each POI.

2. **MPTD2**: This dataset is a more concise version of MPTD1, containing a subset of POIs along with their tags, texts, and images that are semantically related to the tags. It was created to facilitate more efficient model training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are constructed by the authors themselves and not published elsewhere, they may not have formal citations in the traditional sense. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

For **MPTD1**, the relevant details are:
- Dataset Name: MPTD1
- Description: Multi-modal POI Tagging Dataset with 63,415 POIs, 354 unique tags, and 197,254 POI-tag pairs.

For **MPTD2**, the relevant details are:
- Dataset Name: MPTD2
- Description: A concise dataset derived from MPTD1, containing a smaller subset of POIs with semantically related tags, texts, and images.

Since these datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will format the citations as follows:

- For **MPTD1**:
  > Yang, J., Han, G., Yang, D., Liu, J., Xiao, Y., Xu, X., Wu, B., & Ni, S. (2023). MPTD1: Multi-modal POI Tagging Dataset. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '23), August 6–10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA.

- For **MPTD2**:
  > Yang, J., Han, G., Yang, D., Liu, J., Xiao, Y., Xu, X., Wu, B., & Ni, S. (2023). MPTD2: Concise Multi-modal POI Tagging Dataset. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '23), August 6–10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations for further processing or review.
