To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Understanding Structural Vulnerability in Graph Convolutional Networks" by Liang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide statistics for each one. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**
2. **Cora-ML**
3. **Citeseer**
4. **Pubmed**

I will note down the statistics provided for each dataset, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as these details are important for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Cora**:
  > McCallum, A., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Inf. Retr.*, 3(2), 127–163.

- For **Cora-ML**:
  > McCallum, A., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Inf. Retr.*, 3(2), 127–163. (Note: Cora-ML is a variant of Cora, so the citation may be the same.)

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93–106.

- For **Pubmed**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93–106. (Note: Pubmed is also often cited with the same reference as Citeseer.)

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
