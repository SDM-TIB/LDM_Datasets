To extract datasets from the research paper titled "URRL-IMVC: Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering" by Ge Teng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors list **six multi-view datasets** used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Handwritten Dataset**: This dataset consists of images and is used for clustering tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Robert Duin. 2023. Multiple Features. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5HC70.

2. **Caltech101-7 Dataset**: This dataset is also composed of images and is used for clustering. The citation is:
   > Xiao Cai, Feiping Nie, and Heng Huang. 2013. Multi-view k-means clustering on big data. In Twenty-Third International Joint conference on artificial intelligence.

3. **ALOI_Deep Dataset**: This dataset contains images and is used for clustering tasks. The citation is:
   > Guoqing Chao, Shiliang Sun, and Jinbo Bi. 2021. A Survey on Multiview Clustering. IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence 2, 2 (2021), 146–168.

4. **Scene15 Dataset**: This dataset includes images and is used for clustering. The citation is:
   > L. Fei-Fei and P. Perona. 2005. A Bayesian hierarchical model for learning natural scene categories. In 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’05), Vol. 2. 524–531 vol. 2. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.16.

5. **BDGP Dataset**: This dataset includes both images and text data. The citation is:
   > Massih R. Amini, Nicolas Usunier, and Cyril Goutte. 2009. Learning from Multiple Partially Observed Views - an Application to Multilingual Text Categorization. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

6. **Reuters Dataset**: This dataset consists of text data and is used for clustering. The citation is:
   > Ian Goodfellow et al. 2014. Generative Adversarial Nets. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Vol. 27. Curran Associates, Inc.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted for reference in future work.
