To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Wearable Gait Phase Segmentation For Running And Walking" by Jien-De Sui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of gait phase detection and mention the use of IMU sensor data. However, I need to look for specific datasets in the methodology section.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** within the methodology. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the subjects involved and the tasks performed. They mention that data was collected from three normal subjects during running and walking tasks at various speeds, which indicates that a dataset was created from this data collection.

The authors specify that the ground truth data was collected using the **Optojump system**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context. They also mention that the total duration of the raw dataset is **1593 seconds**, which is important for describing the dataset's size.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the tools and systems mentioned. The **Optojump system** is referenced in the context of collecting ground truth data, but it may not have a specific citation in the references. Instead, I will note that it is a system used for measuring contact times during activities.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name or a specific dataset citation, I will summarize the dataset based on the information provided:

1. **Gait Phase Dataset**: This dataset consists of IMU sensor data collected from three subjects performing walking and running tasks at various speeds (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, and 19 km/h). The dataset includes both the IMU data and the ground truth labels obtained from the Optojump system, which measures contact times with 1 ms accuracy. The total duration of the dataset is 1593 seconds.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and any citations that can be found in the references. If no formal citation exists for the dataset itself, I will note the tools used for data collection and their significance.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
