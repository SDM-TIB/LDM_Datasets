To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Relational Bias on Knowledge Graphs" by Yu-Neng Chuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark knowledge graph datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **FB15K-237**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating fairness in gender-occupation bias. It contains a large number of entities and relations, specifically designed for knowledge graph tasks.

2. **Pokec-KG**: This dataset is derived from a social network in Slovakia and is constructed from user attributes to form a knowledge graph. The authors mention that it includes five representative attributes.

3. **NBA-players**: This dataset consists of statistical records for NBA players, focusing on nationality-salary bias. The authors explain how they transformed salary attributes into groups for analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality.

- For **Pokec-KG**, the citation is:
  > Takac, L., & Zabovsky, M. (2012). Data analysis in public social networks. In International Scientific Conference and International Workshop Present Day Trends of Innovations.

- For **NBA-players**, the citation is:
  > NBA-players dataset. (2016). Retrieved from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
