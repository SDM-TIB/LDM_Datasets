To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "FESS LOSS: Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss for Optimizing Medical Image Analysis" by Charulkumar Chodvadiya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of medical image segmentation and hints at the use of datasets without naming them.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **BraTs 2016 Dataset**: This dataset includes high-quality multi-modal MRI scans from 274 patients, specifically using the FLAIR modality for their task.
2. **BraTs 2017 Dataset**: Similar to the 2016 dataset, this one includes MRI scans from 285 patients, also focusing on the FLAIR modality.
3. **Combined BraTs Dataset**: This dataset is a combination of the BraTs 2016 and 2017 datasets, enhancing sample diversity.
4. **AbdomenCT-1K Dataset**: This dataset consists of over a thousand abdominal CT scans from various vendors and phases, used to assess the generalizability of their approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **BraTs 2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michela Antonelli, Annika Reinke, Spyridon Bakas, Keyvan Farahani, Annette Kopp-Schneider, Bennett A. Landman, Geert Litjens, Bjoern Menze, Olaf Ronneberger, Ronald M. Summers, et al. "The medical segmentation decathlon." *Nature Communications*, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 4128, 2022.

- For the **BraTs 2017 Dataset**, the citation is the same as the BraTs 2016 dataset since it is part of the same series:
  > Michela Antonelli, Annika Reinke, Spyridon Bakas, Keyvan Farahani, Annette Kopp-Schneider, Bennett A. Landman, Geert Litjens, Bjoern Menze, Olaf Ronneberger, Ronald M. Summers, et al. "The medical segmentation decathlon." *Nature Communications*, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 4128, 2022.

- For the **AbdomenCT-1K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Ma, Yao Zhang, Song Gu, Cheng Zhu, Cheng Ge, Yichi Zhang, Xingle An, Congcong Wang, Qiyuan Wang, Xin Liu, et al. "AbdomenCT-1K: Is abdominal organ segmentation a solved problem?" *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 44, no. 10, pp. 6695â€“6714, 2021.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
