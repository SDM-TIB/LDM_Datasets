To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Make a BLT Sandwich? Learning to Reason towards Understanding Web Instructional Videos" by Shaojie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **YouQuek dataset**, which is an annotated QA dataset for instructional videos based on the **YouCook2 dataset**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **introduction** and **dataset description sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that the YouQuek dataset is based on YouCook2, which is the largest instructional video dataset. This suggests that I need to gather more information about both datasets.

In the **dataset section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **YouQuek dataset**, stating that it contains **15,355 manually-collected QA pairs** categorized by different reasoning styles. They also mention that it is the first reasoning-oriented dataset aimed at instructional videos. This section confirms the existence of the YouQuek dataset and provides insights into its structure and purpose.

The authors also reference the **YouCook2 dataset** as the foundation for the YouQuek dataset. I will need to extract the full citation for YouCook2 as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **YouQuek Dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but since it is derived from YouCook2, I will note that it is a new dataset introduced by the authors.

2. **YouCook2 Dataset**: The citation for the YouCook2 dataset is:
   > Zhou, L., Xu, C., & Corso, J. J. (2018). *Towards automatic learning of procedures from web instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), pages 7590â€“7598.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **YouQuek Dataset**: An annotated QA dataset for instructional videos based on YouCook2, containing 15,355 QA pairs categorized by reasoning styles.
- **YouCook2 Dataset**: The largest instructional video dataset that serves as the foundation for the YouQuek dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
