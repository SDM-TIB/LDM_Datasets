To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards High-Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction from In-the-Wild Images Using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Jiangke Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a large-scale database of high-resolution UV maps for face textures, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation details section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the face image dataset used in the experiments. It is known for containing a large number of celebrity images with various attributes annotated.

2. **Basel Face Model (BFM)**: This is mentioned as the 3D morphable face model used in the experiments. It provides a statistical model of facial shape and texture built from scanned faces.

3. **FaceWarehouse**: This dataset is referenced as a source for the expression coefficients used in the 3DMM model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **Basel Face Model**, the citation is:
  > Pascal Paysan, Reinhard Knothe, Brian Amberg, Sami Romdhani, and Thomas Vetter. *A 3D face model for pose and illumination invariant face recognition*. In 2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance, pages 296–301. IEEE, 2009.

- For **FaceWarehouse**, the citation is:
  > Chen Cao, Yanlin Weng, Shun Zhou, Yiying Tong, and Kun Zhou. *Facewarehouse: A 3D facial expression database for visual computing*. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 20(3):413–425, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
