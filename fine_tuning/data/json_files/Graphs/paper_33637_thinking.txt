To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Efficient Tuning and Inference for Large Language Models on Textual Graphs" by Yun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it will likely contain the names, characteristics, and purposes of the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A dataset consisting of 2,708 scientific publications categorized into seven classes, with a total of 5,429 edges.
2. **CiteSeer**: This dataset contains 3,186 scientific publications categorized into six classes, with 4,277 edges.
3. **WikiCS**: A Wikipedia-based dataset for benchmarking graph neural networks, featuring 11,701 nodes and 215,863 edges.
4. **OGBN-ArXiv**: A directed graph representing the citation network among computer science arXiv papers, with 169,343 edges and 40 subject areas.
5. **ArXiv-2023**: A directed graph similar to OGBN-ArXiv but for papers published in 2023 or later.
6. **OGBN-Products**: A large-scale dataset with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges, from which a subset is used in the experiments.
7. **Ele-Photo**: Derived from the Amazon-Electronics dataset, this dataset contains nodes representing electronics products and their co-purchase relationships.

Next, I will verify the full citations for each dataset by checking the **References section** of the paper. This is essential to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the information from the paper.
