To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeaD: End-to-end Text-to-SQL Generation with Schema-aware Denoising" by Kuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **WikiSQL benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention the **WikiSQL dataset**, describing it as consisting of 56,355 training pairs, 8,421 validation pairs, and 15,878 test pairs. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and its purpose in the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiSQL dataset. The authors do not provide a direct citation in the text, but I can infer that the original paper describing the WikiSQL dataset is likely referenced. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the WikiSQL dataset:
> Zhong, Victor, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. "Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.00103, 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process as follows:

1. **Identify the dataset**: The primary dataset mentioned is the **WikiSQL dataset**.
2. **Describe the dataset**: It consists of 56,355 training pairs, 8,421 validation pairs, and 15,878 test pairs, all of which are natural language to SQL query pairs.
3. **Find the citation**: The full citation for the dataset is obtained from the references.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset details and citations are accurately represented.
