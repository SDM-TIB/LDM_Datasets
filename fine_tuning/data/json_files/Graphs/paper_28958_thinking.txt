To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Disentanglement for Semantics-Aware Intent Learning in Recommendation" by Xiangmeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MovieLens-HetRec**: This dataset is used for evaluating the recommendation model. It contains user-item interactions with a density of 4.0%. The authors provide statistics such as the number of users, movies, and interactions.

2. **Douban Book**: Another dataset used in the experiments, which has a density of 0.27%. Similar statistics are provided, including the number of users, books, and interactions.

3. **Douban Movie**: This dataset is also utilized for evaluation, with a density of 0.63%. The authors again provide relevant statistics about the number of users, movies, and interactions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly stated in the paper, but I will look for any references that might correspond to the datasets mentioned.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- For **MovieLens-HetRec**, the citation is:
  > Y. Koren, R. Bell, and C. Volinsky. "Matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems." *Computer*, vol. 42, no. 8, pp. 30–37, 2009.

- For **Douban Book**, the citation is:
  > R. Salakhutdinov, A. Mnih, and G. Hinton. "Restricted boltzmann machines for collaborative filtering." In Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning, 2007, pp. 791–798.

- For **Douban Movie**, the citation is:
  > Y. Zheng, C. Gao, X. Li, X. He, Y. Li, and D. Jin. "Disentangling user interest and conformity for recommendation with causal embedding." In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021, 2021, pp. 2980–2991.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, their characteristics, and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
