To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic retrieval of corresponding US views in longitudinal examinations" by Hamideh Kerdegari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a self-supervised contrastive learning approach using data from **67 patients** in the ICU, which indicates that patient data is a key component of the study.

Next, I will look into the **Materials** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the research. Here, the authors mention that the muscle ultrasound exams were performed on **67 patients** with data acquired between June 2020 and February 2022. They also specify that each patient had an average of six muscle ultrasound examinations, totaling **402 examinations**. This suggests that the dataset consists of ultrasound images collected from these patients over multiple time points.

In the **Experiments and Results** section, the authors provide quantitative results based on the dataset, including metrics like AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, they do not mention any external datasets or publicly available datasets, which means the dataset used is likely proprietary or specific to their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or methodology that could provide additional context or validation. However, the references primarily focus on related works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will summarize the dataset based on the information provided in the **Materials** section:

1. **Muscle Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of ultrasound images collected from **67 ICU patients**. The data was acquired over multiple examinations (average of six per patient), totaling **402 examinations**. The images were captured using GE Venue Go and GE Vivid IQ machines, and the study was conducted following ethical guidelines.

As there are no external datasets cited, I will note that the dataset is specific to this study and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the context of the dataset as described in the paper.
