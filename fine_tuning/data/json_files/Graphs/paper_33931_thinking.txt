To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LVIC: Multi-modality segmentation by Lifting Visual Info as Cue" by Zichao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes LiDAR semantic segmentation benchmark**, indicating that this dataset is likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. Here, they explicitly mention the **nuScenes LiDAR semantic segmentation dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it is used.

In section IV.A, the authors describe the **nuScenes dataset** as a well-known multimodal dataset tailored for 3D object detection in urban environments. They provide specific details such as the number of driving sequences, the frequency of LiDAR data, and the privacy measures taken in the dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the **nuScenes dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **nuScenes LiDAR semantic segmentation dataset**: This dataset is designed for 3D object detection in urban environments, consisting of 1000 distinct driving sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. It includes meticulous 3D bounding box annotations and operates at a frequency of 20Hz for LiDAR data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
