To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoCLIM: Towards Accurate Cancer Subtyping via Multi-Omics Contrastive Learning with Omics-Inference Modeling" by Ziwei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **six cancer datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly list the six cancer types along with their respective sample sizes and feature sizes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA)**: 671 samples with features from genomics, microRNA, epigenomics, and mRNA transcriptomics.
2. **Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)**: 414 samples with similar feature categories.
3. **Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD)**: 573 samples.
4. **Brain Lower Grade Glioma (LGG)**: 434 samples.
5. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)**: 295 samples.
6. **Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV)**: 302 samples.

In the same section, the authors provide a **Table 2** that summarizes the details of these datasets, including the number of samples and the preprocessed feature sizes for each omics category.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The datasets are derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the authors mention that they obtained the data through the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal. Therefore, I will cite the TCGA as the source for all datasets.

The full citation for the TCGA is:
> The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma*. Nature, 499(7456):43â€“49, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
