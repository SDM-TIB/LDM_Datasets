To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Imbalance Aware Graph Augmentation Learning" by Zulong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five benchmark datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset consisting of 2,708 nodes (papers) and 5,278 edges (citations). The features are bag-of-words vectors of the corresponding paper titles, and the labels correspond to the categories of the papers.

2. **CiteSeer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset contains 3,327 nodes and 4,552 edges, with features and labels structured in the same way.

3. **Chameleon**: This dataset consists of 2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges, representing a page-to-page network on specific topics in Wikipedia.

4. **Squirrel**: Another Wikipedia page-to-page network, this dataset has 5,201 nodes and 217,073 edges.

5. **Actor**: This dataset contains 7,600 nodes and 30,019 edges, representing an actor-only induced subgraph of the film-director-actor-writer network.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
