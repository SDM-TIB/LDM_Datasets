To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Ins-HOI: Instance Aware Human-Object Interactions Recovery" by Jiajun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors collected a large-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the significance of human/hand-object interactions and mention the creation of two datasets: **Ins-Sit** and **Ins-Grasp**. This section provides context for the datasets and their intended use.

I will then focus on the **datasets section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset:

1. **Ins-Sit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,700 scans involving human-chair interactions, collected from 72 subjects performing various poses on different chair types. The authors mention that they fit SMPL-X to the human parts in the scans and annotate semantic labels for research purposes.

2. **Ins-Grasp Dataset**: This dataset includes 500 scans of hand-object interactions, collected from 20 volunteers interacting with 50 different objects. The authors describe the fitting of MANO and NIMBLE models to the hand scans for potential research applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are newly created by the authors, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the authors' own descriptions and the context in which they are presented.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **Ins-Sit Dataset**:
  > Zhang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H., Zhou, B., Shao, R., Hu, Z., & Liu, Y. (2023). Ins-Sit: A dataset for human-chair interactions. In *Ins-HOI: Instance Aware Human-Object Interactions Recovery*.

- For **Ins-Grasp Dataset**:
  > Zhang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H., Zhou, B., Shao, R., Hu, Z., & Liu, Y. (2023). Ins-Grasp: A dataset for hand-object interactions. In *Ins-HOI: Instance Aware Human-Object Interactions Recovery*.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
