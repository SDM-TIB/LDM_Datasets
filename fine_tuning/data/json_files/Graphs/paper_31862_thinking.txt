To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling for Long-Tailed Object Detection" by Burhaneddin Yaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LVIS v1.0 benchmark dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they evaluated their proposed method on the **LVIS v1.0 dataset**, which contains 1.3 million object instances across 120K images and includes 1203 categories. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset's characteristics, including its long-tail distribution and the categorization of instances into frequent, common, and rare classes.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the LVIS dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the LVIS dataset is as follows:
> Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5356â€“5364, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the LVIS dataset, I will not find additional datasets mentioned. However, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the LVIS dataset, including its significance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review.
