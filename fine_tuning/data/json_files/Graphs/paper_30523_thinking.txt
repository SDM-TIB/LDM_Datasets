To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Probabilistic Representations" by Haoyu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **Pascal VOC** and **CityScapes** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were used. The authors specifically mention that they conducted experiments on **Pascal VOC 2012** and **CityScapes**. In this section, I will look for any specific details about the datasets, such as the number of images, the nature of the annotations, and any additional datasets that might have been used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 1464 well-annotated images for training and 1449 images for validation. The authors also mention that they introduced SBD (Semantic Boundaries Dataset) as additional training data, which consists of additional annotated images.

2. **CityScapes**: This dataset includes 2975 training images and 500 validation images, specifically designed for urban scene understanding.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **CityScapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding. *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 3213-3223.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
