To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oversmoothing: A Nightmare for Graph Contrastive Learning?" by Jintang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several real-world graph benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention evaluating their method on five datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, **Amazon-Photo**, and **Amazon-Computer**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the statistics for these datasets, which include:
- **Cora**: 2,708 nodes, 10,556 edges, 1,433 features, 7 classes.
- **Citeseer**: 3,327 nodes, 9,104 edges, 3,703 features, 6 classes.
- **Pubmed**: 19,717 nodes, 88,648 edges, 500 features, 3 classes.
- **Amazon-Photo**: 7,650 nodes, 238,162 edges, 745 features, 8 classes.
- **Amazon-Computer**: 13,752 nodes, 491,722 edges, 767 features, 10 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original papers or sources for the datasets, which is crucial for proper citation.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations:
- **Cora**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.
  
- **Citeseer**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Amazon-Photo**: 
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *Relational Representation Learning Workshop*, NeurIPS.

- **Amazon-Computer**: 
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *Relational Representation Learning Workshop*, NeurIPS.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation for proper attribution.
