To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Latent Graph Dynamics for Visual Manipulation of Deformable Objects" by Xiao Ma, David Hsu, and Wee Sun Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on deformable manipulation tasks, which may involve specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **high-fidelity simulator, Nvidia Flex**, for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets in the text. Instead, they refer to the use of depth images collected from their simulation environment.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may correspond to datasets used in their experiments. I will look for papers that describe datasets related to deformable object manipulation or similar tasks.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that may correspond to datasets or methods used in the experiments:

1. **SoftGym**: 
   > Xingyu Lin, Yufei Wang, Jake Olkin, and David Held. *Softgym: Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for deformable object manipulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.07215, 2020.

2. **Nvidia Flex**: 
   > Gianni Ciccarelli. *Particle-based fluid simulation with nvidia flex*. 2019.

These references indicate that the authors utilized the SoftGym environment and Nvidia Flex for their experiments, which may imply the use of datasets generated within these frameworks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or relevant work mentioned. Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note the simulation environments as the primary sources of data for their experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
