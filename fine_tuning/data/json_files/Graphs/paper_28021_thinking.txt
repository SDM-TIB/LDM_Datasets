To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot Problems" by Qing Chen and Jian Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluated their method on **two benchmark datasets** for few-shot learning, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss their approach and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to **mini-ImageNet** and **tiered-ImageNet** as the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about these datasets. They describe **mini-ImageNet** as consisting of 100 categories with 64 for training, 16 for validation, and 20 for testing, with 600 images in each set. They also describe **tiered-ImageNet** as containing 608 classes split into 351 training, 97 validation, and 160 testing classes, each with approximately 1300 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 3630–3638, 2016.

- For **tiered-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Mengye Ren, Eleni Triantaﬁllou, Sachin Ravi, Jake Snell, Kevin Swersky, Joshua B Tenenbaum, Hugo Larochelle, and Richard S Zemel. *Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.00676, 2018.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset.
