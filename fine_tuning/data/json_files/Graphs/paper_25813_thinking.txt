To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network Embedding as Matrix Factorization: Unifying DeepWalk, LINE, PTE, and node2vec" by Jiezhong Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using four widely-used datasets for their experiments, which are summarized in **Table 2**. This table lists the datasets along with their statistics, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social network of bloggers with 10,312 nodes, 333,983 edges, and 39 labels.
2. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions)**: A subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, consisting of 3,890 nodes, 76,584 edges, and 50 labels.
3. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network of words from the first million bytes of the Wikipedia dump, containing 4,777 nodes, 184,812 edges, and 40 labels.
4. **Flickr**: A user contact network in Flickr with 80,513 nodes, 5,899,882 edges, and 195 labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BlogCatalog**: 
  > Z. Yang, J. Tang, and W. Cohen. *Multi-Modal Bayesian Embeddings for Learning Social Knowledge Graphs*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2016.

- **PPI**: 
  > C. Stark et al. *The BioGRID interaction database: 2011 update*. Nucleic Acids Research, 39(suppl_1):D698â€“D704, 2010.

- **Wikipedia**: 
  > T. Mikolov et al. *Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3781, 2013.

- **Flickr**: 
  > L. Tang and H. Liu. *Relational learning via latent social dimensions*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their relevant details from the paper.
