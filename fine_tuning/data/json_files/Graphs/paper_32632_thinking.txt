To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning noise-induced transitions by multi-scaling reservoir computing" by Zequn Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their method to "two categories of scenarios," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or experimental data in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **results** section, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention applying their method to "two categories of scenarios," which include data generated from stochastic differential equations and experimental data of protein folding. I will look for specific dataset names and details in this section.

In the **examples** subsection, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **Bistable Gradient System with White Noise**: This dataset is generated from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and is described in detail, including parameters like noise strength and the duration of the time series.

2. **Bistable Gradient System with Colored Noise**: Similar to the previous dataset, this one is also generated from an SDE but incorporates colored noise.

3. **Bistable Non-Gradient System**: This dataset is generated from a different set of equations and includes noise-induced transitions.

4. **Experimental Data of Protein Folding**: The authors refer to a specific dataset related to protein folding, which is crucial for their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the original papers or sources from which the datasets are derived. For example, the protein folding data is cited as:

- R. Tapia-Rojo et al. "Enhanced statistical sampling reveals microscopic complexity in the talin mechanosensor folding energy landscape." *Nat. Phys.* 19, 52 (2023).

For the bistable gradient systems, I will look for the original papers that describe the stochastic differential equations used to generate the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the results and examples sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for each identified dataset.
