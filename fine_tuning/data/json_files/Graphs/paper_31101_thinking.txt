To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Purposeful and Operation-based Cognitive System for AGI" by Shimon Komarovsky, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the cognitive model proposed, but it does not mention any datasets directly. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, evaluations, or any empirical results. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the use of datasets. 

As I read through the paper, I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the data was collected from" to identify specific datasets. If the paper discusses experiments or evaluations, it may also reference datasets used for training or testing the cognitive model.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for citations that provide the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that no datasets were identified in the text.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their proper citations.
