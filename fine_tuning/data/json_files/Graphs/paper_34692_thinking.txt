To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphFM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Foundation Model" by Yuhao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the evaluation of various self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models across different datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset and Implementations)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their benchmarking process. Here, they mention six widely used graph node classification datasets, which are crucial for understanding the scope of their experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,552 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,324 features, and 3 classes.
4. **Flickr**: A social network dataset with user interactions, featuring 1,000 nodes and 7 classes.
5. **Reddit**: A social network dataset with 41 classes and 602 features.
6. **ogbn-arxiv**: A citation dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark with 40 classes and 128 features.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
