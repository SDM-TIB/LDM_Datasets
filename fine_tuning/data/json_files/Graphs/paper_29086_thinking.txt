To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DisARM: Displacement Aware Relation Module for 3D Detection" by Yao Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **SUN RGB-D** and **ScanNet V2**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors evaluate their method on two specific datasets:

1. **SUN RGB-D**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of performance evaluation. I will confirm its details in the experiments section.

2. **ScanNet V2**: Similar to SUN RGB-D, this dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SUN RGB-D**, the citation is:
  > Shuran Song, Samuel P Lichtenberg, and Jianxiong Xiao. *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D Scene Understanding Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 567–576, 2015.

- For **ScanNet V2**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
