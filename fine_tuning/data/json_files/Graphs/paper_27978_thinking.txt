To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Dual Model of Environment- and Place-Specific Utility for Visual Place Recognition" by Nikhil Varma Keetha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Berlin Kudamm**: This dataset is sourced from the crowd-sourced photo mapping platform Mapillary, containing two different perspectives of the same route, with a total traverse span of about 3 km, including 314 frames for the reference traverse and 280 frames for the query traverse.

2. **Oxford RobotCar**: This dataset includes traverses of Oxford city captured during different seasonal cycles and times of the day. The authors used a subsampled version of the Overcast Summer and Autumn Night traverses, resulting in a total traverse span of 1.5 km, with 213 frames in summer and 251 frames during the night.

3. **Nordland**: This dataset captures a 728 km train journey during different seasonal cycles. The authors used the first 7000 images from both the Summer and Winter traverses, resulting in 1000 images for the reference summer traverse and 467 for the query winter traverse.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Berlin Kudamm**, the citation is:
  > Z. Chen, F. Maffra, I. Sa, and M. Chli. *Only look once, mining distinctive landmarks from convnet for visual place recognition*. In 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2017, pp. 9–16.

- For **Oxford RobotCar**, the citation is:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The oxford robotcar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 3–15, 2017.

- For **Nordland**, the citation is:
  > D. Olid, J. M. F´acil, and J. Civera. *Single-view place recognition under seasonal changes*. In PPNIV Workshop at IROS 2018, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
