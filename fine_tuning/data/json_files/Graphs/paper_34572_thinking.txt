To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GANcrop: A Contrastive Defense Against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning" by Xiaoyun Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses federated learning and backdoor attacks but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention that they utilized the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as containing 60,000 samples, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing, across 10 categories. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically available in the literature. The standard citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, I have identified one dataset used in the paper, which is the CIFAR-10 dataset, and I have retrieved its full citation. I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
