To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Deep Embeddings for Inferencing with Multi-Layered Networks" by Huan Song and Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that outlines the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, and layers, as well as the specific tasks they were used for (e.g., node classification, link prediction, community detection).

In the provided text, I see a **Table 1** that lists several datasets along with their statistics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Leskovec-Ng**: 214 nodes, 536 edges, 4 layers.
2. **Reinnovation**: 1728 nodes, 8460 edges, 12 layers.
3. **Congress Votes**: 6672 nodes, 710,717 edges, 16 layers.
4. **Mammography**: 3844 nodes, 1,562,814 edges, 4 layers.
5. **Balance Scale**: 2500 nodes, 312,500 edges, 4 layers.
6. **Vickers**: 87 nodes, 740 edges, 3 layers.
7. **LAZEGA**: 211 nodes, 2571 edges, 3 layers.
8. **C.ELEGANS**: 791 nodes, 5863 edges, 3 layers.
9. **EU Airlines**: 2034 nodes, 3588 edges, 37 layers.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided for datasets, but I will look for any references that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the experiments.

For example, the **Leskovec-Ng dataset** is referenced as:
> Chen, P.-Y., & Hero, A. O. (2017). Multilayer spectral graph clustering via convex layer aggregation: Theory and algorithms. IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks, 3(3), 553–567.

The **Reinnovation dataset** does not have a specific citation in the provided text, but I will note that it describes the global innovation index for 144 countries.

The **Congress Votes dataset** is cited as:
> Schlimmer, J. C. (1987). Concept acquisition through representational adjustment.

The **Mammography dataset** is referenced as:
> Elter, M., Schulz-Wendtland, R., & Wittenberg, T. (2007). The prediction of breast cancer biopsy outcomes using two CAD approaches that both emphasize an intelligible decision process. Medical Physics, 34(11), 4164–4172.

The **Balance Scale dataset** is from:
> Dua, D., & Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The **Vickers dataset** is cited as:
> Vickers, M., & Chan, S. (1981). Representing classroom social structure. Victoria Institute of Secondary Education, Melbourne.

The **LAZEGA dataset** is referenced as:
> Lazega, E., et al. (2001). The collegial phenomenon: The social mechanisms of cooperation among peers in a corporate law partnership. Oxford University Press on Demand.

The **C.ELEGANS dataset** is cited as:
> Chen, B. L., Hall, D. H., & Chklovskii, D. B. (2006). Wiring optimization can relate neuronal structure and function. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(12), 4723–4728.

The **EU Airlines dataset** is referenced as:
> Cardillo, A., Gómez-Gardenes, J., Zanin, M., Romance, M., Papo, D., Del Pozo, F., & Boccaletti, S. (2013). Emergence of network features from multiplexity. Scientific Reports, 3, 1344.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
