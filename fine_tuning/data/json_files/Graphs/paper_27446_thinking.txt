To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ExAD: An Ensemble Approach for Explanation-based Adversarial Detection" by Ninghao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their approach using "three image datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify. The introduction may provide additional context or details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation, which are **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST)**, and **CIFAR-10**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the number of classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. 

The citations I will look for are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE 86, 11 (1998), 2278–2324.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv:cs.LG/1708.07747 [cs.LG].

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
