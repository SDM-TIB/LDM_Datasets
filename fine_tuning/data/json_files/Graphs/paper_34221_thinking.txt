To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fuse after Align: Improving Face-Voice Association Learning via Multimodal Encoder" by Chong Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods section typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of voice-face association learning and reference various studies, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they state that they trained their model on the **VoxCeleb dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of speaker recognition. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of audio clips and face images, as well as the number of identities involved.

The paper mentions that the VoxCeleb dataset comprises **153K audio clips and 1.2M face images of 1225 identities**. This is crucial information that I need to capture.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VoxCeleb dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Arsha Nagrani, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In Interspeech 2017. ISCA, Aug. 2017.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset extraction process and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
