To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DyExplainer: Explainable Dynamic Graph Neural Networks" by Tianchun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the results of the experiments are based on "various datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are used, but it does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on six widely used datasets. I will look for a list or description of these datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1 (Datasets), I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **AS-733**: An autonomous systems dataset of traffic flows among routers comprising the Internet.
2. **Reddit-Title**: A network of subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlinks extracted from posts.
3. **Reddit-Body**: Similar to Reddit-Title, this dataset also consists of subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlinks but is based on the content of the posts.
4. **UCI-Message**: Composed of private communications exchanged on an online social network system among students.
5. **Bitcoin-OTC**: A "who-trusts-whom" network of individuals who engage in trading on this platform.
6. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: Another "who-trusts-whom" network related to trading, similar to Bitcoin-OTC.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references several sources that likely contain the necessary citation information.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations based on the references provided in the paper:

- **AS-733**: 
  > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. "Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations." In ACM SIGKDD, 2005.

- **Reddit-Title** and **Reddit-Body**: 
  > Srijan Kumar et al. "Community interaction and conflict on the web." In WWW, 2018.

- **UCI-Message**: 
  > Pietro Panzarasa, Tore Opsahl, and Kathleen M Carley. "Patterns and dynamics of usersâ€™ behavior and interaction: Network analysis of an online community." Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 2009.

- **Bitcoin-OTC** and **Bitcoin-Alpha**: 
  > Srijan Kumar et al. "Rev2: Fraudulent user prediction in rating platforms." In WSDM, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the datasets from the paper, providing both the names and the necessary citations for each dataset used in the research.
