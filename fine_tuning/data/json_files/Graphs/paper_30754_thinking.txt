To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Predictive Beamforming for IRS-Assisted Multi-User Communications: A Deep Learning Approach" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific datasets that were used for training or testing the proposed models. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are not widely known, I will ensure to provide the original source or citation for those datasets as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
