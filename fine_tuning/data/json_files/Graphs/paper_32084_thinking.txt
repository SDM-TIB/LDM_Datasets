To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SamToNe: Improving Contrastive Loss for Dual Encoder Retrieval Models with Same Tower Negatives" by Fedor Moiseev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on question answering retrieval benchmarks from **MS MARCO** and **MultiReQA**, which suggests that these datasets are significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using **MS MARCO** and **MultiReQA** for their evaluations. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific metrics reported.

In the paper, the authors describe **MS MARCO** as a human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They also mention **MultiReQA**, which is a cross-domain evaluation for retrieval question answering models. I will ensure to capture the context in which these datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I find will be essential for providing proper attribution.

The citation for **MS MARCO** is:
> Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder, Andrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Alina Stoica, Saurabh Tiwary, and Tong Wang. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. 2018.

The citation for **MultiReQA** is:
> Mandy Guo, Yinfei Yang, Daniel Cer, Qinlan Shen, and Noah Constant. *MultiReQA: A cross-domain evaluation for retrieval question answering models*. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Domain Adaptation for NLP, pages 94â€“104, Kyiv, Ukraine. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
