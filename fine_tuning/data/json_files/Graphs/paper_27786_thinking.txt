To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Attentive Are Graph Attention Networks?" by Shaked Brody et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors evaluate their proposed GATv2 model on various benchmarks, which likely includes specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **OGB (Open Graph Benchmark)**: This is a collection of datasets for graph machine learning, which includes multiple datasets for node prediction, link prediction, and graph classification tasks.

2. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset consists of molecular graphs and is used for predicting quantum chemical properties.

3. **VARMISUSE Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of models on program representation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **OGB datasets**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

- For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. Scientific Data, 1, 140022.

- For the **VARMISUSE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allamanis, M., Brockschmidt, M., & Khademi, M. (2018). Learning to represent programs with graphs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future use.
