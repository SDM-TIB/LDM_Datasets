To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SYNGEN: A Syntactic Plug-and-Play Module for Generative Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis" by Chengze Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that empirical results are demonstrated on four popular ABSA datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four datasets: **Rest14, Laptop14, Rest15, and Rest16**. I will take note of these names and any additional details provided about them.

In the **experiments subsection (3.1)**, the authors clarify that these datasets are originally proposed by the SemEval Challenges and that they used a refined version provided by Haiyun Peng, which distills the triplets based on previous relabeled versions. This information is crucial as it indicates the source and potential modifications to the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are likely to be included in the references to the SemEval challenges or the work by Haiyun Peng. 

1. For **Rest14**, the citation is:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. “Semeval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis,” in Proc. of SemEval, 2014.

2. For **Laptop14**, the citation is:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, Mohammad Al-Smadi, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Orphée De Clercq, Véronique Hoste, Marianna Apidianaki, Xavier Tannier, Natalia V. Loukachevitch, Evgeniy V. Kotelnikov, Núria Bel, Salud María Jiménez Zafra, and Gülşen Eryigit. “Semeval-2015 task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis,” in Proc. of SemEval, 2015.

3. For **Rest15**, the citation is:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and others. “Semeval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis,” in Proc. of SemEval, 2016.

4. For **Rest16**, the citation is:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and others. “Semeval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis,” in Proc. of SemEval, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
