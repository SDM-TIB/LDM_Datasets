To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Approach for Mapping Applications to Dataflow-Based Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array" by Andre Xian Ming Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but it may not specify datasets directly. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of various applications such as vector addition, distance calculation, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). I will check if any datasets are explicitly mentioned in relation to these applications.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper does not provide specific datasets but mentions benchmarks or standard datasets used in the field, I will note those as well and provide their citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clearly articulated and properly referenced.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of dataset information from the paper, maintaining academic integrity through proper citation.
