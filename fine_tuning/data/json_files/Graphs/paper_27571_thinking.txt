To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Probing Negative Sampling Strategies to Learn Graph Representations via Unsupervised Contrastive Learning" by Shiyi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments are performed on three real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various graph neural network models and their applications, but I need to find the exact datasets used for their experiments.

In **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention three widely adopted real-world datasets: 

1. **Cora**: This dataset consists of 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: This dataset contains 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: This dataset has 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, and 3 classes.

The authors also provide a table summarizing the statistics of these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed are commonly known datasets in the field of graph representation learning, and their citations are as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A.K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127–163.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Giles, C.L., Bollacker, K.D., Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries*, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, pp. 89–98.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Zitnik, M., Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33, i190–i198.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.
