To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Change Point Detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Predictive Coding" by Shohreh Deldari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three diverse, widely used time series datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Yahoo! Benchmark**: This dataset is described as one of the most widely cited benchmarks for anomaly detection, containing time series with varying trends, seasonalities, and noise, including random anomaly change points. The authors used all 100 time series of the fourth benchmark.

2. **HASC**: The HASC challenge 2011 dataset provides human activity data collected by multiple sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. The authors used a subset of this dataset, focusing on 3-axis accelerometer recordings to detect transitions between physical activities.

3. **USC-HAD**: This dataset includes recordings of twelve human activities across multiple subjects, with each subject fitted with a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. The authors randomly selected 30 activities from the first six participants for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Yahoo! Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Research Webscope Dataset. "S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0." https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/

- For **HASC**, the citation is:
  > Nobuo Kawaguchi et al. "HASC Challenge: Gathering Large Scale Human Activity Corpus for the Real-World Activity Understandings." ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1145/1959826.1959853

- For **USC-HAD**, the citation is:
  > Mi Zhang and Alexander A. Sawchuk. "USC-HAD: a Daily Activity Dataset for Ubiquitous Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors." In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp â€™12), 2012. 

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
