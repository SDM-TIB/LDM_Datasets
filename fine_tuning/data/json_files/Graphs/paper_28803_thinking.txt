To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal aware Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network For Session-based Recommendation" by Shixuan Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names and details in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they list three datasets: 

1. **RetailRocket**: This dataset contains behavior data and item properties collected from a real-world e-commerce website. The statistics provided include the number of items, sessions, average session length, and average time interval.

2. **Yoochoose**: This is a RecSys Challenge dataset consisting of click-streams from an e-commerce website. The authors specify that they used the most recent fractions of the dataset for their experiments.

3. **Jdata**: This dataset records historical interactions from JD.com, capturing user actions over a two-month period. The authors mention that they filtered sessions and items based on specific criteria.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the datasets are commonly known in the research community, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will summarize the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself:

- For **RetailRocket**, the citation is:
  > RetailRocket. *RetailRocket e-commerce dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > Yoochoose. *RecSys Challenge dataset*. Retrieved from http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html.

- For **Jdata**, the citation is:
  > Jdata. *JD.com historical interactions dataset*. Retrieved from https://jdata.jd.com/html/detail.html?id=8.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
