To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReSSL: Relational Self-Supervised Learning with Weak Augmentation" by Mingkai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and empirical study sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of self-supervised learning and mention various datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical study section** where the authors detail their experiments. This section typically contains explicit mentions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It has 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes 96x96 resolution images of 10 classes, comprising 5,000 labeled training images, 8,000 validation images, and 100,000 unlabeled images.

4. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 64x64 resolution images across 200 classes, with 100,000 training images and 10,000 validation images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2011.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Abai, Z., Rajmalwar, N. *Densenet Models for Tiny ImageNet Classification*. 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
