To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Article Classification with Graph Neural Networks and Multigraphs" by Khang Ly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Open Graph Benchmark OGBN-arXiv dataset** and the **PubMed diabetes dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research and should be detailed further.

Next, I will look into **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **OGBN-arXiv Dataset**: This dataset consists of 169,343 Computer Science papers from arXiv, hand-labeled into 40 subject areas, with a total of 1,166,243 reference links. The authors also mention that default node features are constructed from textual information.

2. **PubMed Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset includes 19,717 papers from the National Library of Medicineâ€™s PubMed database, categorized into three types of diabetes, with 44,338 reference links. The authors provide details about the default node features as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **OGBN-arXiv dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. CoRR, abs/2005.00687.

- For the **PubMed diabetes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, M. G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.
