To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Faithful Text From a Knowledge Graph with Noisy Reference Text" by Tahsina Hashem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **House Dataset**: This dataset is derived from real-estate and point-of-interest data in Melbourne, Australia, containing 53,220 records of house sales transactions from 2013 to 2015. Each record includes a ground-truth advertisement text that describes the features of the house.

2. **GenWiki Dataset**: This is a large-scale non-parallel dataset prepared by matching Wikipedia articles with DBpedia entities, specifically the "FINE" version mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **House Dataset**, the citation is:
> Das, S. S., Ali, M. E., Li, Y. F., Kang, Y. B., & Sellis, T. (2021). Boosting house price predictions using geospatial network embedding. *Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery*, 35(6), 2221-2250.

For the **GenWiki Dataset**, the citation is:
> Jin, Z., Guo, Q., Qiu, X., & Zhang, Z. (2020). GenWiki: A dataset of 1.3 million content-sharing text and graphs for unsupervised graph-to-text generation. In *Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics*, pages 2398â€“2409.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
