To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Large-scale Network Embedding from Representative Subgraph" by Junsheng Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the experiments section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets. Specifically, I will focus on **Table 2**, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets used for the vertex classification task. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: This dataset is described as a subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, with vertex labels obtained from hallmark gene sets representing biological states.

2. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset represents a network of social relationships among online bloggers, where vertex labels indicate the interests of the bloggers.

3. **YouTube**: This dataset consists of a video-sharing platform where users are labeled by the video genres they liked.

Next, I will verify the citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**, the citation is:
  > Stark, C., Breitkreutz, B.-J., Chatr-Aryamontri, A., Boucher, L., Oughtred, R., Livstone, M. S., Nixon, J., Van Auken, K., Wang, X., Shi, X., et al. (2010). The BioGRID interaction database: 2011 update. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 39(suppl 1), D698–D704.

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > Agarwal, N., Liu, H., Murthy, S., Sen, A., & Wang, X. (2009). A social identity approach to identify familiar strangers in a social network. In *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*, volume 3.

- For **YouTube**, the citation is:
  > Tang, L., & Liu, H. (2009). Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions. In *Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management*, 1107–1116.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding references from the paper.
