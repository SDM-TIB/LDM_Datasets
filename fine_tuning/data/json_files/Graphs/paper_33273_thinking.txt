To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointMoment: Mixed-Moment-based Self-Supervised Representation Learning for 3D Point Clouds" by Xin Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large-scale annotated data for point clouds, hinting at the datasets they might use for their experiments. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Pre-training)**, they mention using the **ModelNet40 dataset** for pre-training, which consists of CAD models of 40 common objects. They provide details about the number of point clouds used for training and testing.

In **section 4.2 (Downstream tasks)**, the authors mention two datasets for evaluating their method: **ModelNet40** and **ScanObjectNN**. They describe the characteristics of these datasets, including the number of categories and objects, which is crucial for understanding their application.

Additionally, in **section 4.2.2**, they refer to the **ShapeNetPart dataset** for the object part segmentation task, detailing its composition and significance in evaluating segmentation methods.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

3. **ShapeNetPart**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
