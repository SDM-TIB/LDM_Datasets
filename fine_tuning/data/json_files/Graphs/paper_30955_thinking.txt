To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persistence-based operators in machine learning" by Mattia G. Bergomi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are more likely to contain specific dataset names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of topological data analysis with machine learning but do not mention specific datasets yet. I will move on to the **experiments section** to find concrete references to datasets.

In **section 4 (Computational experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but these images represent fashion items instead of digits.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each 32x32 pixels in size, categorized into 10 classes such as airplane, automobile, and dog.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017. arXiv:cs.LG/1708.07747.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
