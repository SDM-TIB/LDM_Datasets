To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Recognition" by Tianhong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their method on:

1. **CIFAR-10-LT**: This dataset is a long-tailed version of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which has been sampled with an exponential decay across classes. The authors mention that it is used for evaluating their method under various imbalance ratios.

2. **CIFAR-100-LT**: Similar to CIFAR-10-LT, this is a long-tailed version of the CIFAR-100 dataset, also sampled with an exponential decay across classes.

3. **ImageNet-LT**: This dataset is a long-tailed version of the ImageNet dataset, which is widely used in computer vision tasks. The authors note that it is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

4. **iNaturalist**: This dataset contains a large number of classes and is used for species classification. The authors mention that it is available under CC0, CC BY, or CC BY-NC licenses.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the original datasets are cited as:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, et al. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8769–8778, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
