To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TVDIM: Enhancing Image Self-Supervised Pretraining via Noisy Text Data" by Pengda Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel self-supervised visual learning method and hints at the use of image-text pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for self-supervised pretraining. They explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Conceptual Captions Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3.3 million image-caption pairs automatically scraped from web images. The authors note that the average length of captions is around 10 words and that there is a high information overlap between the images and their corresponding captions.

2. **MM-IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is built from the Movielens 20M dataset and comprises 25,959 movies along with their plot, poster, genres, and other metadata fields. The authors specifically use the (poster, plot) pairs as their image-text pairs.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide additional details about how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Conceptual Captions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2556–2565.

- For the **MM-IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arevalo, J., Solorio, T., Montes-y Gómez, M., & González, F. A. (2017). Gated multimodal units for information fusion. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.01992.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their full citations, and prepare to format them according to the required structure. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
