To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mobility and Cost Aware Inference Accelerating Algorithm for Edge Intelligence" by Xin Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the methodologies used, including the datasets employed for testing the proposed algorithms. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, such as its composition (e.g., number of images, classes, etc.) and its relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly presented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and accurately represented.
