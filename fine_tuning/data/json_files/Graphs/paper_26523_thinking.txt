To extract datasets from the research paper titled "paper2repo: GitHub Repository Recommendation for Academic Papers" by Huajie Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on real-world datasets collected from GitHub and Microsoft Academic, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Research Paper Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32,029 research papers collected from Microsoft Academic, spanning various computer science venues from 2010 to 2018. The dataset includes paper titles, abstracts, and other relevant metadata.

2. **Repository Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,571 repositories sourced from GitHub, with 2,107 of these being bridge repositories that correspond to the research papers. The authors mention that they collected this dataset through the GitHub API, which adds credibility to its relevance.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers but are rather collections of data from existing platforms (Microsoft Academic and GitHub). Therefore, I will note the sources as follows:

- For the **Research Paper Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft Academic. *Microsoft Academic Graph*. Retrieved from https://academic.microsoft.com.

- For the **Repository Dataset**, the citation is:
  > GitHub. *GitHub API*. Retrieved from https://docs.github.com/en/rest.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
