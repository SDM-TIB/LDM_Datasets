To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instant Graph Neural Networks for Dynamic Graphs" by Yanping Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using three public datasets: **Arxiv**, **Products**, and **Papers100M**, along with a co-authorship network dataset called **Aminer** and several synthetic datasets generated using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM).

I will then look for a **table summarizing the datasets** (Table 2) that provides specific details about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, and other relevant statistics. This table will help me accurately describe each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Arxiv**: A citation network dataset.
2. **Products**: A co-purchasing network dataset from Amazon.
3. **Papers100M**: A large-scale citation network dataset.
4. **Aminer**: A co-authorship network derived from academic social networks.
5. **SBM-500K**: A synthetic dataset with 500,000 nodes.
6. **SBM-1M**: A synthetic dataset with 1,000,000 nodes.
7. **SBM-5M**: A synthetic dataset with 5,000,000 nodes.
8. **SBM-10M**: A synthetic dataset with 10,000,000 nodes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. The paper may not provide explicit citations for all datasets, especially for synthetic ones, but I will ensure to document any available references.

For the datasets that are publicly available, I will include the following citations:

- **Arxiv**: Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.
  
- **Products**: Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

For the synthetic datasets (SBM-500K, SBM-1M, SBM-5M, SBM-10M), since they are generated for the purpose of the study, I will note that they are based on the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and do not have specific citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references.
