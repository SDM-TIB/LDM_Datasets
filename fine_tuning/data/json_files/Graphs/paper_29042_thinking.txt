To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIFT: Graph-guIded Feature Transfer for Cold-Start Video Click-Through Rate Prediction" by Yi Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "large real-world dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention the **Taobao Dataset**, which is described as consisting of user interaction logs with short videos on the Taobao App. The dataset is divided into two parts: **D_full** and **D_cold**. 

1. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset includes hundreds of millions of user interaction logs. It consists of:
   - **D_full**: A uniformly sampled dataset from 15-day user interaction logs of all videos.
   - **D_cold**: A subset of D_full that includes user interaction logs on new videos launched less than 3 days.

The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of users, items, and samples, which further confirms its significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Taobao Dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not attributed to a specific publication but is rather a proprietary dataset used by Alibaba Group for their internal applications. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from Alibaba Group without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant statistics or details that were provided in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **Taobao Dataset**, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study. I will ensure to document this dataset accurately for any future reference or analysis.
