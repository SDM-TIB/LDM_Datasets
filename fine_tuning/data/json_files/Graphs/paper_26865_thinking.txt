To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A general approach for identifying hierarchical symmetry constraints for analog circuit layout" by Kishor Kunal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there may be a section that explicitly lists the datasets used for testing the proposed methodology. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper does not have a specific section for datasets, I will search through the **methodology** and **results** sections. These sections often contain information about the datasets used, especially if the authors discuss their experimental setup or the results obtained from specific datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as pages and year of publication.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "ALIGN" for their experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will note any related works mentioned in the paper that could lead me to the original dataset source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
