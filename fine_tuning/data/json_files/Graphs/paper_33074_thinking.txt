To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings" by Ruize An, Chen Zhang, and Dawei Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and transfer learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) to find specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on **seven STS tasks** and **seven transfer learning tasks**. I will look for the names of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the text, I find that the authors specifically mention the **STS Benchmark** dataset in the implementation details. They also reference the datasets used for the transfer learning tasks, which include MR (Movie Reviews), CR (Customer Reviews), SUBJ (Subjectivity), MPQA (Multi-Perspective Question Answering), SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank), TREC (Text REtrieval Conference), and MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus).

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
