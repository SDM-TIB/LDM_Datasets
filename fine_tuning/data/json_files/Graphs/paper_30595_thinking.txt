To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "PCQA-GRAPHPOINT: EFFICIENT DEEP-BASED GRAPH METRIC FOR POINT CLOUD QUALITY ASSESSMENT" by Marouane Tliba et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **two well-known datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors state that they used two publicly available benchmarks: **ICIP20** and **PointXR**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for a **detailed description** of each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. The authors mention that the **ICIP20 dataset** is composed of 6 reference point clouds, with 90 degraded versions derived from various compression methods. The **PointXR dataset** consists of 5 point clouds, also with 45 degraded versions created through specific compression techniques. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ICIP20**, the citation is:
  > S. Perry et al., “Quality evaluation of static point clouds encoded using MPEG codecs,” in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2020, pp. 3428–3432.

- For **PointXR**, the citation is:
  > N. Yang, E. Alexiou, and T. Ebrahimi, “PointXR: A toolbox for visualization and subjective evaluation of point clouds in virtual reality,” 2020.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
