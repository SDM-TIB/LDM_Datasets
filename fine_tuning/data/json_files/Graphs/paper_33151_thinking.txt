To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATLANTIC: Structure-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Interdisciplinary Science" by Sai Munikoti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention leveraging the **S2ORC (Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus)**, which is a large corpus of curated scientific papers. The authors describe how they preprocess this dataset to create a collection of text passages.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the S2ORC dataset, including its size (31.1 million English-language scientific papers) and the number of text passages created (354 million). They also mention that the dataset captures 19 different scientific domains, which is important for understanding the breadth of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the S2ORC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lo, K.; Wang, L. L.; Neumann, M.; Kinney, R.; and Weld, D. S. (2019). *S2ORC: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.02782.

Since the S2ORC dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
