To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Spectral Augmentation" by Jing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "multiple real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the DBLP Academic Search website and includes various types of nodes such as authors, papers, conferences, and terms. The authors provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of nodes and edges, as well as the classification target.

2. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from the ACM database and similarly includes nodes representing papers, authors, and subjects. The authors again provide detailed statistics and the classification target for this dataset.

3. **Freebase Dataset**: This dataset is related to movies and includes nodes for movies, actors, directors, and writers. The authors provide statistics on the number of nodes and edges, along with the classification target.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fu, X., Zhang, J., Meng, Z., & King, I. (2020). Magnn: Metapath aggregated graph neural network for heterogeneous graph embedding. In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2020 (pp. 2331–2341).

- For the **ACM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhao, J., Wang, X., Shi, C., Liu, Z., & Ye, Y. (2020). Network schema preserving heterogeneous information network embedding. In International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).

- For the **Freebase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Ding, D., Kao, B., Sun, Y., & Mamoulis, N. (2021). Leveraging meta-path contexts for classification in heterogeneous information networks. In 2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) (pp. 912–923). IEEE.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
