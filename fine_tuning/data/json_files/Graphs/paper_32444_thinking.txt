To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Disentanglement and Fusion on Modality and Context in Conversational Multimodal Emotion Recognition" by Bobo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two public MM-ERC datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using two datasets: **MELD** and **IEMOCAP**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of both datasets:

1. **MELD**: This dataset consists of conversation snippets from the TV show "Friends," containing 1,433 dialogues and 13,708 utterances, with emotions labeled as joy, sadness, neutral, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust.

2. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset comprises 151 dialogues and 7,433 utterances, featuring two speakers per session and emotions labeled as happy, sad, neutral, angry, excited, and frustrated.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations*. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 527–536, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p19-1050

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N. Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4):335–359, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-008-9076-6

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
