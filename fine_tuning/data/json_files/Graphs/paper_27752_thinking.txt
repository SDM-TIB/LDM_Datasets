To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Human Pose Regression Using Graph Convolutional Network" by Soubarna Banik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **Human3.6M dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset. The introduction discusses the challenges of 3D human pose estimation and mentions the use of the Human3.6M dataset, reinforcing its importance.

In the **results section**, specifically section 3.3, the authors provide a detailed description of the Human3.6M dataset. They mention that it contains 3.6 million RGB images of 7 subjects performing 15 actions, with both 2D and 3D joint locations available. This section confirms that the Human3.6M dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Human3.6M dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Human3.6M dataset**:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the Human3.6M dataset is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Human3.6M dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
