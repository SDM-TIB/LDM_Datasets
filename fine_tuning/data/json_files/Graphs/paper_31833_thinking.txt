To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Effective Visual Representations for Partial-Label Learning" by Shiyu Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. In this paper, the authors mention using four widely used benchmark datasets: **Fashion-MNIST**, **SVHN**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100**. I will note down these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also discuss how they manipulated these datasets to create partially labeled versions. This is important for understanding the context of the datasets in relation to the proposed method.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Fashion-MNIST**:
   > Xiao, H., Rasul, H., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

2. **SVHN**:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning.

3. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Citeseer.

4. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Citeseer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
