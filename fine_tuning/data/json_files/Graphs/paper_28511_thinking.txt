To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FocusFace: Multi-task Contrastive Learning for Masked Face Recognition" by Pedro C. Neto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of face recognition with masks and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the necessity for robust face recognition systems due to the pandemic but do not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention using the **MS1MV2 dataset** for training, which is a refined version of the original MS-Celeb-1M dataset. They also mention augmenting this dataset with face masks.

In addition, they refer to the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset for validation purposes. This dataset is widely used in face recognition research and is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating their algorithm.

Next, I will check the **test dataset** section, where the authors describe the dataset used for testing their method. They mention a dataset collected during the masked face recognition competition, which includes images of subjects captured with and without masks.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MS1MV2 Dataset**:
   > Guo, Y., Zhang, L., Hu, Y., He, X., & Gao, J. (2016). *MS-Celeb-1M: A dataset and benchmark for large-scale face recognition*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 87-102). Springer.

2. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**:
   > Huang, G. B., Mattar, M., Berg, T., & Learned-Miller, E. (2008). *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In Workshop on faces in 'Real-Life' Images: detection, alignment, and recognition.

3. **Masked Face Recognition Competition Dataset**:
   > Boutros, F., Damer, N., Kolf, J. N., Raja, K., Kirchbuchner, F., Ramachandra, R., Kuijper, A., Fang, P., Zhang, C., Wang, F., et al. (2021). *MFR 2021: Masked face recognition competition*. In 2021 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB) (pp. 1-10). IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset in the required format for further processing or review. This systematic approach allows me to extract and cite datasets effectively from the research paper.
