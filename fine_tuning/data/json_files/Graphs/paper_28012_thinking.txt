To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithmic Concept-based Explainable Reasoning" by Dobrik Georgiev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In the abstract, the authors discuss the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to various tasks, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology and experimental setup sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including how they were generated or sourced. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the algorithms they applied and the datasets they used for training and testing. They mention generating datasets for specific tasks like breadth-first search (BFS), parallel coloring, and Kruskal’s algorithm. I will note down the datasets mentioned, including any relevant details about their generation or characteristics.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional insights or clarifications regarding the datasets used in the experiments. Authors sometimes provide further context or comparisons that can help in understanding the datasets better.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Erdős-Rényi graphs" or "Barabási-Albert graphs," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
