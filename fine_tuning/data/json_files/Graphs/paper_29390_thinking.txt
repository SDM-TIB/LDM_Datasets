To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffCSE: Difference-based Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings" by Yung-Sung Chuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its evaluation, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **4.2 Data section**, the authors mention using **106 randomly sampled sentences from English Wikipedia** for unsupervised pretraining. This indicates that the dataset is derived from Wikipedia, which is a well-known resource for various NLP tasks.

Additionally, the authors evaluate their model on **7 semantic textual similarity tasks (STS)** and **7 transfer tasks from SentEval**. I will need to identify the specific datasets used for these tasks, which are likely detailed in the references or within the context of the experiments.

For the **STS tasks**, the paper lists:
- **STS 2012–2016** (Agirre et al., 2016)
- **STS Benchmark** (Cer et al., 2017)
- **SICK-Relatedness** (Marelli et al., 2014)

For the **transfer tasks**, the paper mentions:
- **MR** (Pang and Lee, 2005)
- **CR** (Hu and Liu, 2004)
- **SUBJ** (Pang and Lee, 2004)
- **MPQA** (Wiebe et al., 2005)
- **SST-2** (Socher et al., 2013)
- **TREC** (Voorhees and Tice, 2000)
- **MRPC** (Dolan and Brockett, 2005)

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
