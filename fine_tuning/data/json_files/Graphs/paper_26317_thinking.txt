To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Hop Convolutions of Weighted Graphs" by Qikui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on six publicly available datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide context for each one. 

The paper mentions two categories of datasets: **medical image datasets** and **citation network datasets**. I will extract the datasets from each category as follows:

1. **Medical Image Datasets**:
   - **ABIDE Dataset**: The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database is described as containing neuroimaging data from 539 individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 573 age-matched controls. The citation for this dataset is:
     > Di Martino, A., Yan, C.-G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F. X., Alaerts, K., Anderson, J. S., Assaf, M., Bookheimer, S. Y., Dapretto, M., et al. (2014). *The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism*. Molecular Psychiatry, 19(6), 659.
   
   - **TADPOLE Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and consists of 557 patients with multi-modal features. The citation for this dataset is:
     > Marinescu, R. V., Oxtoby, N. P., Young, A. L., Bron, E. E., Toga, A. W., Weiner, M. W., Barkhof, N., Fox, N. C., Klein, S., Alexander, D. C., et al. (2018). *Tadpole challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer’s disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909.
   
   - **CXR Dataset**: This dataset consists of chest X-ray images from 662 subjects, divided into normal and abnormal categories. The citation for this dataset is:
     > Jaeger, S., Candemir, S., Antani, S., Wang, Y.-X. J., Lu, P.-X., & Thoma, G. (2014). *Two public chest x-ray datasets for computer-aided screening of pulmonary diseases*. Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery, 4(6), 475.

2. **Citation Network Datasets**:
   - **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset contains citation links between documents. The citation for this dataset is:
     > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. International Conference on Machine Learning, 40–48.
   
   - **Cora Dataset**: Similar to Citeseer, this dataset also consists of citation links. The citation is the same as for Citeseer.
   
   - **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset consists of publications described by TF/IDF weighted word vectors. The citation is also the same as for Citeseer.

After identifying and extracting the datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
