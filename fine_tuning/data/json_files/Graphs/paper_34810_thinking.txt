To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Causal Metapath Graph Neural Network for Gene-Microbe-Disease Association Prediction" by Kexin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on gene-microbe-disease associations, which suggests that datasets related to these associations may be included.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors discuss the dataset construction. Here, they mention that they constructed a dataset of gene-microbe-disease associations using several public databases. This section is crucial as it likely contains specific details about the datasets used.

In this section, the authors list the sources of their data:

1. **GIMICA**: This database is referenced for gene-microbe associations. The authors cite it as a source for their dataset.
2. **gutMGene**: Another source for gene-microbe associations, which is also mentioned in the context of dataset construction.
3. **MicroPhenoDB**: This database is used for microbe-disease associations.
4. **GutMDdisorder**: Another source for microbe-disease associations.
5. **Peryton**: This database is also referenced for microbe-disease associations.
6. **DisGeNET**: This source is used for gene-disease associations.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **GIMICA**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
