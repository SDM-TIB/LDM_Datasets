To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST-RAP: A Spatio-Temporal Framework for Real Estate Appraisal" by Hojoon Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "large-scale real estate dataset," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Preliminaries)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they constructed a real estate dataset from the Republic of Korea, which is categorized into four categories: Transaction, Resident, Amenity, and Transportation. This section provides specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of records and features for each category.

The details I will extract include:

1. **Transaction Dataset**: Contains 3,632,022 records with 13 attributes, including transaction type, date, land area, and price.
2. **Resident Dataset**: Comprises 41,871 records with 25 features, such as location and number of buildings.
3. **Amenity Dataset**: Includes 15,000 amenities (e.g., schools, hospitals).
4. **Transportation Dataset**: Contains 13,500 transportation stations (e.g., train, subway, bus).

I will also note the connections between these entities, which are significant for understanding the dataset's structure.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the authors created their own dataset, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Hojoon Lee, Hawon Jeong, Byungkun Lee, Kyungyup Lee, and Jaegul Choo. 2023. ST-RAP: A Spatio-Temporal Framework for Real Estate Appraisal. In Proceedings of ACM Conference (CIKMâ€™23). ACM, Birmingham, UK, 5 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/1122445.1122456

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information and citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
