To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree Structure-Aware Graph Representation Learning via Integrated Hierarchical Aggregation and Relational Metric Learning" by Ziyue Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: **DBLP**, **IMDB**, and **YELP**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets in **section IV (Experiment)**. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **DBLP**: An academic bibliography with millions of publications, focusing on four areas: Data Mining, Database, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. The dataset includes papers, authors, and venues.

2. **IMDB**: A dataset about movies, which includes information on movies, actors, directors, and tags, specifically focusing on three genres: Action, Comedy, and Drama.

3. **YELP**: A dataset containing restaurant reviews, which includes customers, reviews, keywords, and restaurants, focusing on various types of cuisine.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided for the datasets or the original sources from which they were derived. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. *DBLP Computer Science Bibliography*. Available at: https://www.aminer.cn/citation

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > IMDB. *TMDB Movie Metadata*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

- For **YELP**, the citation is:
  > YELP. *Yelp Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
