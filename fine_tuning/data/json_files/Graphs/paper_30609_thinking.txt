To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retention Time Prediction for Chromatographic Enantioseparation by Quantile Geometry-enhanced Graph Neural Network" by Hao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a **chiral molecular retention time dataset (CMRT dataset)** has been established, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in data acquisition and the importance of datasets in machine learning for chemistry. They mention the CMRT dataset again, emphasizing its significance in the context of their research.

In the **results section**, the authors provide detailed information about the CMRT dataset, including that it consists of retention times for **25,847 molecules** and includes **11,720 pairs of enantiomers**. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its contents.

I will also check the **methods section** where the authors describe how the CMRT dataset was constructed by collecting experimental data from **644 articles** related to asymmetric catalysis. This is crucial information that adds to the dataset's credibility and scope.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CMRT dataset. Since the dataset is derived from multiple articles, I will note that the dataset itself does not have a single citation but is based on the collective work of the authors of those articles.

The full citation for the CMRT dataset is:
> Xu, H., Lin, J., Zhang, D., & Mo, F. *Retention Time Prediction for Chromatographic Enantioseparation by Quantile Geometry-enhanced Graph Neural Network*. [Journal Name, Volume, Page Numbers, Year].

Now, I will compile the information about the CMRT dataset, ensuring to include the full citation in the final output.
