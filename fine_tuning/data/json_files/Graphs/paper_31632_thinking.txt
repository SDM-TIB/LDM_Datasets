To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RadarGNN: Transformation Invariant Graph Neural Network for Radar-based Perception" by Felix Fent et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model outperforms previous methods on the **RadarScenes dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of radar-based perception and mention the **RadarScenes dataset** as the primary dataset used for evaluation. This section provides context for why this dataset is significant.

In the **related work section**, the authors discuss various radar datasets, including **Dense**, **PixSet**, **Zendar**, **Oxford Radar RobotCar**, **MulRan**, **RADIATE**, and **nuScenes**. However, they emphasize that the **RadarScenes dataset** is chosen for their work due to its comprehensive point-wise annotations and the fact that it includes data from production automotive radar sensors.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors confirm that they evaluated their model on the **RadarScenes dataset**, which includes point-wise annotated radar data of moving objects assigned to eleven different categories.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **RadarScenes dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **RadarScenes Dataset**:
  > Ole Schumann, Markus Hahn, Nicolas Scheiner, Fabio Weishaupt, Julius F. Tilly, Jurgen Dickmann, and Christian Wohler. *Radarscenes: A real-world radar point cloud data set for automotive applications*. In Proceedings of 2021 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION), pages 1â€“8, Piscataway, NJ, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that while other datasets are mentioned, the focus of the paper is primarily on the **RadarScenes dataset**, which is used for the experiments and results presented.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **RadarScenes dataset** as it is the primary dataset used in the research. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and meets the requirements for citation accuracy.
