Therefore, we can automatically obtain the 〈Question, AnswerList〉 pairs by parsing the html structure. The whole dataset is randomly split to 197,936/25,000/25,000 for train, validation, and test.",

(2) The answers scattered in different positions of the passage, which can be recognized by rules and patterns based on the page structures. Finally, we check the selected pages by human and obtain the final dataset, including 31,597/4,000/4,000 for train, validation, and test.",
