To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Audio Patterns in Music with Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition for Structural Segmentation" by Axel Marmoret et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **RWC Pop dataset** for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This indicates that a dataset is indeed used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experiments in detail. Here, they explicitly mention that they tested their method on the **RWC Pop Music dataset** and refer to the MIREX10 annotations as the reference segmentation. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RWC Pop dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **RWC Music Database**: 
  > M. Goto, H. Hashiguchi, T. Nishimura, and R. Oka. *RWC Music Database: Popular, Classical and Jazz Music Databases*. In ISMIR, vol. 2, 2002, pp. 287â€“288.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the RWC Pop dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
