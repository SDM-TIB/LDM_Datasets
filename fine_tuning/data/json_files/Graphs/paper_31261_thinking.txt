To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DMMG: Dual Min-Max Games for Self-Supervised Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Shannan Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "widely-used NTU-RGB+D and NTU120-RGB+D datasets," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section V) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 (NTU-60)**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset for 3D skeleton-based action recognition, recorded by Kinect V2 sensors, containing 56,880 3D skeleton sequences from 40 different performers covering 60 daily actions.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 (NTU-120)**: This dataset is an extension of NTU RGB+D 60, containing 113,945 skeleton sequences covering 120 action classes, recorded from 106 different performers across various camera views.

3. **NTU RGB+D 61-120 (NTU-61-120)**: This is a subset of NTU RGB+D 120, containing 57,367 3D skeleton sequences covering the last 60 action classes in NTU RGB+D 120, with no overlap with NTU RGB+D 60.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684â€“2701, 2020.

- For **NTU RGB+D 61-120**:
  > This dataset is a subset of NTU RGB+D 120, so it does not have a separate citation but is referenced in the context of the NTU RGB+D 120 citation.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
