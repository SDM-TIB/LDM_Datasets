To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Task-oriented Dialog Model with Task-progressive and Policy-aware Pre-training" by Lucen Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model achieves better results on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Pre-training datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training their model. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **MultiWOZ**: A large-scale multi-domain dataset for task-oriented dialogue modeling.
2. **KVRET**: A dataset designed for key-value retrieval networks in task-oriented dialogue.
3. **MSRE2E**: A dataset for end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems.
4. **Frames**: A corpus that adds memory to goal-oriented dialogue systems.
5. **CamRest676**: A dataset for restaurant booking dialogues.

In this section, the authors also discuss their approach to unify dialog act annotations across these datasets, which indicates their importance in the context of the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- **MultiWOZ**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation by other researchers.
