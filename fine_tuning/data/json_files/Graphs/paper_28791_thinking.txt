To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning via Consistent Assignment of Views to Clusters" by Thalles Silva and Adín Ramírez Rivera, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, while the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using several standard computer vision datasets, which is a good indication that specific datasets will be detailed later.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 RGB images, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. It has 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes an unsupervised portion with 100,000 96x96 RGB images and a supervised set with 5,000 images from 10 classes.

4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 64x64 RGB images balanced across 200 different categories.

5. **DS ImageNet**: A downsampled version of the original ImageNet dataset, which has 1,281,167 images across 1,000 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the datasets are standard and widely used in the field, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general citations for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. 2009. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Toronto.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. 2011. An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS).

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Patryk Chrabaszcz, Ilya Loshchilov, and Frank Hutter. 2017. A Downsampled Variant of ImageNet as an Alternative to the CIFAR datasets. arXiv preprint 1707.08819.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. 2009. ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
