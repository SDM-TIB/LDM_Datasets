To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D-Mol: A Novel Contrastive Learning Framework for Molecular Property Prediction with 3D Information," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method on **7 benchmarks**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of molecular property prediction and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for both pretraining and finetuning. Here, they explicitly list the datasets utilized in their experiments:

1. **ZINC20**: This dataset is used for pretraining and consists of 20 million unlabeled molecules, which are publicly accessible and contain drug-like compounds.

2. **PubChem**: Another dataset used for pretraining, which also contains a large collection of chemical information.

3. **BACE**: This dataset provides quantitative (IC50) and qualitative (binary label) binding results for inhibitors targeting human β-secretase 1.

4. **Tox21**: A public database containing qualitative toxicity measurements for 12 biological targets.

5. **ToxCast**: A comprehensive collection of toxicology data obtained through in vitro high-throughput screening.

6. **SIDER**: A compilation of marketed drugs and their associated adverse drug reactions categorized into 27 system organ classes.

7. **ESOL**: A dataset providing information on the log solubility in mols per liter for common organic small molecules.

8. **FreeSolv**: This dataset offers experimental and calculated hydration-free energy values for small molecules dissolved in water.

9. **Lipophilicity (Lipo)**: Contains experimental data on the octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD at pH 7.4).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for **ZINC20** is:
> Irwin, J. J., et al. "ZINC20—a free ultralarge-scale chemical database for ligand discovery." *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 60(12):6065–6073, 2020.

The citation for **PubChem** is:
> Wang, Y., et al. "Pubchem: a public information system for analyzing bioactivities of small molecules." *Nucleic Acids Research*, 37(suppl_2):W623–W633, 2009.

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring that I gather accurate and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized for further research.
