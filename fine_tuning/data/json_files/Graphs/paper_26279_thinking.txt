To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Graph Representation Learning for Open-Domain Question Answering" by Salvatore Vivona and Kaveh Hassani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on the **WebQuestionsSP benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **results section** where the authors discuss their model's performance on the **WebQuestionsSP dataset**. They mention that this dataset consists of 4,737 natural language questions, which provides a clear description of the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are any specific details about how the dataset was utilized. However, the primary focus appears to be on the WebQuestionsSP dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the WebQuestionsSP dataset. The authors reference the dataset in relation to Freebase entities, which is important for proper citation.

The citation for the WebQuestionsSP dataset is:
> Chen Liang, Jonathan Berant, Quoc Le, Kenneth Forbus, and Ni Lao. *Glove: Global vectors for word representation*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1532â€“1543, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses the WebQuestionsSP dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WebQuestionsSP dataset, ready for further processing or review.
