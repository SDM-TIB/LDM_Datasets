To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MISS: Multi-Interest Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Click-Through Rate Prediction" by Wei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three large-scale datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon-Cds**: This dataset is derived from user review data collected from Amazon, specifically focusing on CDs. The authors note that it contains user interactions and spans from May 1996 to July 2014.

2. **Amazon-Books**: Similar to the Amazon-Cds dataset, this dataset is also sourced from Amazon and focuses on user reviews for books. It shares the same time span as the Amazon-Cds dataset.

3. **Alipay**: This dataset was provided in the IJCAI-16 contest and includes user behavior logs from Tmall.com, Taobao.com, and the Alipay App, covering interactions from July 1st to November 30th, 2015.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **Amazon datasets**, the citations are typically attributed to the original Amazon dataset papers, which may not be explicitly listed in this paper. However, I can reference the general Amazon dataset citation:

- **Amazon Dataset**: 
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 2013.

For the **Alipay dataset**, the citation is:
- **Alipay Dataset**: 
  > Alipay. *Alipay Dataset for the IJCAI-16 Contest*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=53.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
