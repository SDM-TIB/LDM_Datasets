To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Spatial and Multi-Scale Aware Visual Class Embedding" by Sungguk Cha and Yooseung Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract mentions a novel benchmark called **PASCAL2COCO**, which suggests that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** and **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors reference existing benchmarks like **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i**, indicating that these are also datasets used in their work.

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors describe **PASCAL-5i** as consisting of images from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with additional annotations, and **COCO-20i** as a dataset derived from MS COCO 2017. 

I will also check the **conclusion** and **references** sections to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The full citations I need to extract are:

1. **PASCAL-5i**:
   > Everingham, M., Eslami, S. M. A., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2015). The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 111(1), 98–136.

2. **COCO-20i**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, 740–755.

3. **PASCAL2COCO**: This benchmark is introduced in the paper, but since it is a novel benchmark proposed by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Cha, S., & Wang, Y. (2023). Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Spatial and Multi-Scale Aware Visual Class Embedding. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
