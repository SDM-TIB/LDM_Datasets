To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Efficient and High-performance AI Accelerators with Customized STT-MRAM" by Kaniz Mishty and Mehdi Sadi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their usage in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets in the context of their experiments, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like "ImageNet" or "CIFAR-10," I will look up the full citation for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, year, and any relevant pages or DOI links.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and concise manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
