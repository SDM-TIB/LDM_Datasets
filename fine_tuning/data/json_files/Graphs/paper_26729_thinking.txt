To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-based link prediction analysis for Facebook100 network" by Tim PoÅ¡tuvan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention using the **Facebook100 dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **Data and Datasets sections** of the paper, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention that the Facebook100 dataset includes a complete set of people from Facebook networks for 100 different colleges and universities in the USA, recorded in September 2005. This dataset consists of 3.2 million nodes and 23.7 million links, which is significant for their analysis.

The authors also describe how they created three specific datasets for their experiments:
1. **Baseline Dataset**: This dataset contains only topology-based features.
2. **Topological Dataset**: This dataset includes both topology-based and node-based features.
3. **Embedding Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using node-based features and the Hadamard product of the corresponding nodes' embeddings.

In the **Datasets section**, the authors explain the process of generating positive and negative instances for link prediction tasks, which further clarifies how the datasets were structured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Facebook100 dataset is referenced as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
