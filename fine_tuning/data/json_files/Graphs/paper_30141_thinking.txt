To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Prerequisite-driven Q-matrix Refinement for Learner Knowledge Assessment: A Case Study in Online Learning Context" by Wenbin Gan and Yuan Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Assist0910**: This dataset was collected from 2009 to 2010 using the ASSISTment system. It contains interactions from 3,002 learners with 17,705 items associated with 123 skills, resulting in 277,540 interaction records.

2. **Assist1213**: This dataset updates Assist0910 and was collected throughout 2012. It includes 22,339 learners who attempted 52,825 mathematics questions requiring 265 skills, totaling nearly 2.7 million interaction records.

3. **EdNet**: This is a newly available dataset that includes 5,000 students who answered 12,372 questions requiring 188 skills, resulting in 347,866 interaction logs.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are publicly available and the authors have provided links to their sources, I will include those links as part of the citation.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Assist0910**: 
  > ASSISTment system dataset (2009-2010). Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/assistment-2009-2010-data/skill-builder-data-2009-2010

- **Assist1213**: 
  > ASSISTment system dataset (2012-2013). Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/2012-13-school-data-with-affect

- **EdNet**: 
  > EdNet dataset. Available at: http://bit.ly/ednet_kt1

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
