To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Cross-Modal Artist Retrieval" by Andres Ferraro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of music similarity and mention the use of multiple modalities, hinting at the datasets involved. However, I need to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.2 Training Data**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for training their model:

1. **Million Song Dataset (MSD)**: This dataset is described as a public dataset that facilitates reproducibility. It includes audio track embeddings, tags, and collaborative filtering (CF) embeddings for 17,478 artists.

2. **In-house Dataset (OWN)**: This dataset contains multimodal information for 38,301 artists and is noted to be larger and of higher quality than MSD.

Additionally, in the **evaluation dataset subsection (2.3)**, the authors refer to the **OLGA public dataset**, which contains artist similarity information collected from AllMusic. This dataset serves as the ground truth for evaluating artist similarity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Million Song Dataset (MSD)**, the citation is:
  > Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). *The Million Song Dataset*. In ISMIR.

- For the **OLGA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Korzeniowski, F., Oramas, S., & Gouyon, F. (2021). *Artist similarity with graph neural networks*. In ISMIR.

The in-house dataset (OWN) does not have a formal citation as it is proprietary to the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
