To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Image Representations from Ultrasound Videos with Hard Negative Mining" by Soumen Basu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a large-scale ultrasound video dataset for gallbladder malignancy detection, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in medical imaging and the need for annotated data, hinting at the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe two main datasets:

1. **In-house US Dataset for Gallbladder Cancer**: This dataset consists of 64 videos and 15,800 frames, with 32 malignant and 32 non-malignant videos. It is acquired from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India, and includes detailed information about the video acquisition process.

2. **Public Lung US Dataset for COVID-19**: This dataset includes the Butterﬂy dataset, which consists of 22 US videos containing 1,533 images of the lung, and the POCUS dataset, which contains 2,116 lung US images categorized into COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy control samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **In-house US Dataset for Gallbladder Cancer**, the citation is:

- For the **Butterfly dataset**, the citation is:
  > Butterfly videos. https://www.butterflynetwork.com/index.html, accessed: 2022-03-02.

- For the **POCUS dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
