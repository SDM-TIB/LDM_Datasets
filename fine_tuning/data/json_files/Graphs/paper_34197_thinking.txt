To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast System Technology Co-Optimization Framework for Emerging Technology Based on Graph Neural Networks" by Tianliang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a framework that optimizes power, performance, and area for IC design, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss challenges in the STCO domain and mention the use of TCAD simulations and cell library characterizations. However, they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the methodology section.

In **section II (Fast System Technology Co-Optimization Framework)**, the authors describe their framework and mention the use of various benchmarks, including six ISCAS89 benchmarks and two AI accelerator MAC cores. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific details.

In **section A (GNN-based Surrogate Model for TCAD Simulation)**, the authors describe generating extensive cell datasets for training and testing, which includes nine metrics. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset. I will note that they mention valid data from 125 corners for training and 512 corners for testing, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

In **section B (Unified Compact Model for Emerging Technologies)**, the authors discuss their compact model but do not mention any datasets. 

In **section C (GNN-based Fast Cell Library Characterization Model)**, they mention a comprehensive cell library comprising 35 types of combinational and sequential cells, but still no specific dataset name is provided.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. The references include various papers, but they do not explicitly mention datasets either.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss methodologies and benchmarks, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **ISCAS89 Benchmarks**: These are mentioned as benchmarks used in the study, but no specific dataset citation is provided.
2. **AI Accelerator MAC Cores**: Similar to the ISCAS89 benchmarks, these are referenced without specific dataset details.

Since no formal datasets are explicitly named or cited in the paper, I will note that the authors rely on established benchmarks and methodologies without providing new datasets or their citations.

In conclusion, I will document my findings, emphasizing the lack of specific dataset names and citations in the paper. If I were to create entries for datasets, I would note that they are based on benchmarks commonly used in the field but would not be able to provide full citations as required.
