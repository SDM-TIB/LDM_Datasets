To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiGCN: A Bi-directional Low-Pass Filtering Graph Neural Network" by Zhixian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on citation networks and co-purchase networks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using several benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks. 

In **section 5.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset consisting of 2,708 documents as nodes and 5,278 citation links as edges. It has 1,433 features and 7 classes, with a label rate of 0.052.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 documents as nodes and 4,552 citation links as edges. It has 3,703 features and 6 classes, with a label rate of 0.036.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,717 documents as nodes and 44,324 citation links as edges. It has 500 features and 3 classes, with a label rate of 0.003.

4. **DBLP Dataset**: A citation network dataset used for link prediction tasks, consisting of 17,716 documents as nodes and 105,734 citation links as edges. The features and classes are not specified in the summary.

5. **Amazon Computers Dataset**: A co-purchase network dataset with 13,752 products as nodes and 245,861 co-purchase links as edges. It has 767 features and 10 classes, with a label rate of 0.015.

6. **Amazon Photos Dataset**: Another co-purchase network dataset with 7,650 products as nodes and 119,081 co-purchase links as edges. It has 745 features and 8 classes, with a label rate of 0.021.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
