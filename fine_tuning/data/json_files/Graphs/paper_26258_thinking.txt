To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Category Correlations for Multi-label Image Recognition with Graph Networks" by Qing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method on two datasets: **MS-COCO** and **Fashion550K**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. The authors explicitly state that they validate their method on **MS-COCO** and **Fashion550K**, confirming their use in the study. I will note any specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the number of images.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets:
- **MS-COCO**: A widely used dataset for multi-label image recognition, consisting of 80 categories with 82,081 training images and 40,137 test images.
- **Fashion550K**: A multi-label fashion dataset containing 66 unique weakly-annotated tags with 407,772 images in total.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 740–755.

- For **Fashion550K**, the citation is:
  > Inoue, N., Simo-Serra, E., Yamasaki, T., & Ishikawa, H. (2017). Multi-Label Fashion Image Classification with Minimal Human Supervision. In *CVPR Workshops*.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **MS-COCO**: A large-scale dataset for multi-label image recognition with 80 categories, containing 82,081 training images and 40,137 test images.
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 740–755.

2. **Fashion550K**: A multi-label fashion dataset with 66 unique weakly-annotated tags and a total of 407,772 images.
   - Citation: Inoue, N., Simo-Serra, E., Yamasaki, T., & Ishikawa, H. (2017). Multi-Label Fashion Image Classification with Minimal Human Supervision. In *CVPR Workshops*.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
