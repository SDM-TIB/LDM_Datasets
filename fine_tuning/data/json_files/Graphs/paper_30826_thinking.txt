To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gibbs-Helmholtz Graph Neural Network: Capturing the Temperature Dependency of Activity Coefficients at Infinite Dilution," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model using experimentally determined ln γ∞ data of 40,219 binary systems involving 1,032 solutes and 866 solvents. This suggests that a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods section**. In section 2.1, the authors state that the data used in the study is a subset of the DECHEMA Chemistry Data Series Vol. IX, which is a well-known dataset for ln γ∞ values. They mention that this dataset is not open-source but is crucial for their model development.

In section 2.2, the authors describe the data cleaning process and confirm that the resulting dataset, referred to as the DECHEMA dataset, includes 40,219 data points, 866 solvents, and 1,032 solutes. This dataset is essential for their experiments and model training.

In section 3, the authors discuss the performance of their model using the DECHEMA dataset and compare it with other models. They also mention specific isothermal studies and provide a table summarizing the datasets used for these studies, including the number of solutes, solvents, and observations for each temperature.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DECHEMA Chemistry Data Series. The citation is as follows:
> J. Gmehling, D. Tiegs, A. Medina, M. Soares, J. Bastos, P. Alessi, I. Kikic, M. Schiller, and J. Menke. *Activity Coefficients at Infinite Dilution, volume IX*. DECHEMA Chemistry Data Series, 2008.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference other datasets and models throughout the paper, but the DECHEMA dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
