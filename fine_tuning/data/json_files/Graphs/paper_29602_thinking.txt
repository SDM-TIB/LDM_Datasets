To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Contrastive Learning for Relation Extraction" by William Hogan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of several RE benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention using the **DocRED dataset** for their experiments, which is a significant dataset for relation extraction tasks. They describe it as containing 100k documents, 1.5M relation instances, and 96 relation types.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) and any other relevant sections to see if there are additional datasets mentioned. The authors reference other works that may have used datasets like **TACRED** and **SemEval**, but I need to confirm if they are directly used in this paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **DocRED dataset**, the citation is:
> Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset*. ArXiv, abs/1906.06127, 2019.

For the **TACRED dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhen Wan, Fei Cheng, Qianying Liu, Zhuoyuan Mao, Haiyue Song, and Sadao Kurohashi. *Relation extraction with weighted contrastive pre-training on distant supervision*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2022.

For the **SemEval dataset**, the citation is:
> Iris Hendrickx, Su Nam Kim, Zornitsa Kozareva, Preslav Nakov, Diarmuid Ó Séaghdha, Sebastian Padó, Marco Pennacchiotti, Lorenza Romano, and Stan Szpakowicz. *SemEval-2010 task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 33–38, Uppsala, Sweden. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced later.
