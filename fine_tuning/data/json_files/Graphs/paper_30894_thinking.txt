To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach for Automated Sunquake Detection in Acoustic Emission Maps" by Vanessa Mercea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset from acoustic egression-power maps of solar active regions, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Ingestion and Pre-Processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset creation process. They mention that the dataset spans two solar cycles (SC23 and SC24) and is based on the holography method. They also reference curated lists of sunquake events from previous studies, which will help in identifying the dataset's origins.

In **section 2.2 (Sunquake Identification and Dataset Creation)**, the authors detail the construction of the sunquake dataset. They mention using curated lists from Besliu-Ionescu et al. (2012) and Sharykin and Kosovichev (2020) to identify sunquake candidates. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of events and the methods used for data collection.

The authors state that they created a dataset of acoustic egression power maps for solar active regions, which includes 15 MDI observed events from SC23 and 80 events from SC24. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the dataset based on the curated lists from Besliu-Ionescu et al. (2012):
   > Besliu-Ionescu, D., Donea, A., Cally, P., Lindsey, C. (2012). Web-based Comprehensive Data Archive of Seismically Active Solar Flares. In: Maris, G., Demetrescu, C. (eds.) Advances in Solar and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Research Signpost, Kerala, India.

2. For the dataset based on the positive holography identifications from Sharykin and Kosovichev (2020):
   > Sharykin, I.N., Kosovichev, A.G. (2020). Sunquakes of Solar Cycle 24. Astrophys. J. 895, 76. DOI.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
