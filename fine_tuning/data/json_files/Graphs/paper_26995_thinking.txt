To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VStreamDRLS: Dynamic Graph Representation Learning with Self-Attention for Enterprise Distributed Video Streaming Solutions" by Stefanos Antaris and Dimitrios Rafailidis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on two real-world datasets generated by enterprise live video streaming events, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **LiveStream-400**: This dataset is described as a weighted undirected graph with 386 viewers/nodes and 61,125 connections/edges. It was generated during a live video streaming event where viewers were equally distributed across different offices, and the event lasted for one hour.

2. **LiveStream-20K**: This dataset consists of 20,357 viewers/nodes and 812,810 connections/edges, also generated during a live video streaming event. The viewers were distributed across 25 offices, and each viewer participated for a maximum of one hour.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are generated by the authors themselves and are publicly available, they may not have traditional citations like other datasets. Instead, the authors provide a link to their implementation and datasets on GitHub.

The relevant citation for the datasets would be:
- For **LiveStream-400** and **LiveStream-20K**, the citation is:
  > Antaris, S., & Rafailidis, D. (2023). *VStreamDRLS: Dynamic Graph Representation Learning with Self-Attention for Enterprise Distributed Video Streaming Solutions*. Available at: https://github.com/stefanosantaris/vstreamdrls

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation as specified. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
