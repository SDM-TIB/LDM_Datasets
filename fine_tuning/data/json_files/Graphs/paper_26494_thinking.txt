To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Palmprint Verification On Smartphones" by Yingyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the establishment of a palmprint dataset named **MPD**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is present. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of this dataset for palmprint verification on smartphones.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (MPD: A Benchmark Dataset for Mobile Palmprint Verification)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset:

1. **Mobile Palmprint Database (MPD)**: This dataset is established to facilitate the study of palmprint verification on smartphones. It contains 16,000 palm images collected from 200 subjects, with images taken under various backgrounds and illumination conditions. The dataset is publicly available, which is crucial for reproducibility in research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MPD dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is available at a specific URL, which is essential for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is:

- **Mobile Palmprint Database (MPD)**: 
  > Yingyi Zhang, Lin Zhang, Ruixin Zhang, Shaoxin Li, Jilin Li, and Feiyue Huang. *Towards Palmprint Verification On Smartphones*. Available at: https://cslinzhang.github.io/MobilePalmPrint/.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **Related Works** section, the authors reference several other palmprint datasets, which I will also extract:

2. **CASIA Dataset**: 
   > Hao et al. (2007). *CASIA Multi-Spectral Palmprint Database*. Available at: http://biometrics.idealtest.org/dbDetailForUser.do?id=6.

3. **IIT-D Dataset**: 
   > Kumar (2007). *IIT Delhi Touchless Palmprint Database*. Available at: http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csajaykr/IITD/Database_Palm.htm.

4. **PolyU II Palmprint Dataset**: 
   > Kanhangad et al. (2011). *The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Contact-free 3D/2D Hand Images Database*. Available at: http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csajaykr/Database/3Dhand/Hand3DPose.htm.

5. **Tongji Contactless Palmprint Dataset**: 
   > Zhang et al. (2017). *Tongji Palmprint Dataset*. Available at: http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/contactlesspalm/index.htm.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
