To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning-Based Audio to Lyrics Alignment for Multiple Languages" by Simon Durand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved an average absolute error below 0.2 seconds on the **Jamendo dataset** and released word-level alignments for the **JamendoLyrics Multi-Lang dataset**. This indicates that both datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more details about these datasets. The authors state that they used the **JamendoLyrics Multi-Lang dataset** for evaluation, which features Creative Commons songs and is an extension of the original **JamendoLyrics dataset**. They also mention that the Multi-Lang dataset includes additional languages (German, French, and Spanish) and that they extended it with manually annotated word-level timings.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

1. For the **JamendoLyrics dataset**, the citation is:
   > Daniel Stoller, Simon Durand, and Sebastian Ewert. *End-to-end lyrics alignment for polyphonic music using an audio-to-character recognition model*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2019.

2. For the **JamendoLyrics Multi-Lang dataset**, the citation is:
   > Emir Demirel, Daniel Stoller, and Simon Durand. *JamendoLyrics Multi-Lang â€“ an evaluation dataset for multi-language lyrics research*. Available at: https://github.com/f90/jamendolyrics/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
