To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network-based surrogate model for granular flows" by Yongjin Choi and Krishna Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were generated.

In **subsection 3.2.1 (Granular column collapse)**, the authors mention three types of datasets related to granular column collapse. They provide specific details about the simulations, including the number of trajectories and the simulation configurations. I will note the following datasets:

1. **Granular column collapse with a single material property**: This dataset includes 26 granular flow trajectories of square-shaped granular mass in a two-dimensional box boundary, simulated using the CB-Geo MPM code.

2. **Granular column collapse with multiple material properties**: This dataset includes simulations with five different friction angles, where each case has 60 simulations.

3. **Granular flow interacting with barriers**: This dataset consists of 890 granular flow trajectories of granular mass interacting with barriers in a three-dimensional box boundary, generated using the Taichi MPM code.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For the **CB-Geo MPM code** used in the granular column collapse simulations, the citation is:
  > Kumar, K., & Choi, Y. (2023). Granular column collapse with graph neural network-based simulator. doi:10.17603/DS2-GVVW-GT60.

- For the **Taichi MPM code** used in the granular flow with barriers, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
