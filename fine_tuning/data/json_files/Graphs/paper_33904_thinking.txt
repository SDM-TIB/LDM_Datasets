To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Self-supervised Learning to Network Intrusion Detection for Network Flows with Graph Neural Network" by Renjie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on four real-world databases, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four datasets: **NF-Bot-IoT**, **NF-Bot-IoT-v2**, **NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018**, and **NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of samples. I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

1. **NF-Bot-IoT**: This dataset contains 600,100 network flows, with 13,859 benign samples and 586,241 attack samples across 4 attack types.

2. **NF-Bot-IoT-v2**: An expanded version of NF-Bot-IoT, it includes 37,763,497 network flows, with 135,037 benign samples and 37,628,460 attack samples.

3. **NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018**: This dataset has 8,392,401 network flows, with 7,373,198 benign samples and 1,019,203 attack samples across 14 attack types.

4. **NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2**: An updated version of NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, it contains 18,893,708 network flows, with 16,635,567 benign samples and 2,258,141 attack samples.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
