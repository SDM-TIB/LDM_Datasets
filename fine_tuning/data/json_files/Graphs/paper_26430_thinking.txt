To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Power of Graph Convolutional Networks to Distinguish Random Graph Models" by Abram Magner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss the application of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in various fields, but I need to find specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors do not explicitly list datasets in a separate section, so I will need to identify any datasets mentioned in the context of their experiments or results.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to specific graph models or datasets used for testing the GCNs. The authors mention the use of graphons and stochastic block models, which are types of graph models rather than datasets. However, they may refer to specific datasets or models in the context of their experiments.

After identifying any datasets or models, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for documenting the datasets accurately. I will look for any papers that describe the datasets or models used in their experiments.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific stochastic block model or graphon, I will find the original papers that introduced these concepts and cite them accordingly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset or model mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
