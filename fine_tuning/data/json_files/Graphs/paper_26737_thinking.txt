To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Cleansing with Contrastive Learning for Vocal Note Event Annotations" by Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a data cleansing model for vocal note event annotations and mentions the DALI dataset specifically, which indicates that it is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly state that they tested their approach using the **DALI dataset**, which contains 7756 user-submitted vocal MIDI annotations. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to gather its citation.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **background and related work section** (section 2), where they reference several datasets used in music information retrieval, including **LakhMIDI**, **Free Music Archive**, **MAPS**, **MAESTRO**, and **GuitarSet**. However, I need to confirm whether these datasets were actually used in their experiments or just mentioned for context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The DALI dataset citation is as follows:
- Meseguer-Brocal, G., Cohen-Hadria, A., & Peeters, G. (2018). *DALI: a large dataset of synchronized audio, lyrics and notes, automatically created using teacher-student machine learning paradigm*. In International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR).

For the **LakhMIDI dataset**, the citation is:
- Raffel, C. (2016). *Learning-based methods for comparing sequences, with applications to audio-to-midi alignment and matching*. Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University.

The **Free Music Archive** does not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is a well-known dataset in the field.

The **MAPS dataset** citation is:
- Emiya, V., Badeau, R., & David, B. (2009). *Multipitch estimation of piano sounds using a new probabilistic spectral smoothness principle*. Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing.

The **MAESTRO dataset** citation is:
- Hawthorne, C., Stasyuk, A., Roberts, A., Simon, I., Huang, C.-Z. A., Dieleman, S., Elsen, E., Engel, J., & Eck, D. (2019). *Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

The **GuitarSet dataset** citation is:
- Xi, Q., Bittner, R. M., Ye, X., Pauwels, J., & Bello, J. P. (2018). *GuitarSet: A dataset for guitar transcription*. In International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
