To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Segmentation" by Shentong Mo and Bhiksha Raj, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on AVS-Bench," which indicates that this is a dataset used in their work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **AVSBench** dataset, which contains 4,932 videos with 10,852 total frames from 23 categories.

Now, I will gather details about the AVSBench dataset:
- It is used for weakly-supervised audio-visual segmentation.
- The dataset is split into 3,452 training videos, 740 validation videos, and 740 test videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AVSBench dataset. The authors cite the original work that introduced the AVSBench dataset as follows:
> Jinxing Zhou, Jianyuan Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Weixuan Sun, Jing Zhang, Stan Birchfield, Dan Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Meng Wang, and Yiran Zhong. *Audio-visual segmentation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2022.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the AVSBench dataset, ready for further processing or review.
