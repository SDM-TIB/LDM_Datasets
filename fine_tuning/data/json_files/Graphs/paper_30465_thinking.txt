To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Based Multilingual Label Propagation for Low-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging" by Ayyoob Imani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a method for transferring labels from high-resource to low-resource languages, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in this process.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of POS tagging for low-resource languages and mention the use of a **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**. This indicates that the PBC is a significant dataset used in their research.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference the PBC again, confirming its relevance. They also mention the **Universal Dependencies corpus** as a reference for evaluating their method, which is another dataset of interest.

Moving to the **experimental setup section**, I will look for any specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists various languages along with their corresponding number of verses in the PBC, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**: 
   - Citation: Mayer, T., & Cysouw, M. (2014). Creating a massively parallel Bible corpus. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3158–3163, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **Universal Dependencies corpus**:
   - Citation: Zeman, D., Nivre, J., & Abrams, M. (2019). Universal dependencies 2.5. LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
