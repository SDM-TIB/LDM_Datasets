To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Representation Learning for Unsupervised Cross-domain Image Retrieval" by Conghui Hu and Gim Hee Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **Office-Home** and **DomainNet** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4 domains (Art, Clipart, Product, Real) with a total of 65 categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

2. **DomainNet Dataset**: This dataset includes six different domains (Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch). The authors specify that they selected categories with more than 200 images in each domain for training and testing, which is important for evaluating the dataset's usability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8.

- For the **DomainNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-10.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
