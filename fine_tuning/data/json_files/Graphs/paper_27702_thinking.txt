To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Relevance Scores are Equal: Efficient Uncertainty and Calibration Modeling for Deep Retrieval Models" by Daniel Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on uncertainty in retrieval models, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the **4.1 Data** subsection, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I find that the authors mention three collections:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating retrieval models. It consists of a large number of passages and is referenced in the context of training and validation.

2. **TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track (DLT)**: This dataset is based on the original MS MARCO dataset and is used for evaluating retrieval performance.

3. **Robust04**: This dataset is mentioned as having fine-grained relevance judgments and is used for evaluating uncertainty properties.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for these collections, which confirms their usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. CoRR abs/1611.09268 (2016). arXiv:1611.09268. http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09268

- For **TREC 2019 DLT**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. In Proceedings of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track.

- For **Robust04**, the citation is:
  > J. Shane Culpepper, Charles L. A. Clarke, and Jimmy J. Lin. *Dynamic Cutoff Prediction in Multi-Stage Retrieval Systems*. In Proceedings of the 21st Australasian Document Computing Symposium, ADCS 2016, Caulfield, VIC, Australia, December 5-7, 2016. ACM, 17–24. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3015026

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

1. **MS MARCO**: A large-scale passage dataset used for training and evaluating retrieval models.
   - Citation: Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. CoRR abs/1611.09268 (2016). arXiv:1611.09268. http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09268

2. **TREC 2019 DLT**: A dataset based on MS MARCO for evaluating retrieval performance.
   - Citation: Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. In Proceedings of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track.

3. **Robust04**: A dataset with fine-grained relevance judgments used for evaluating uncertainty properties.
   - Citation: J. Shane Culpepper, Charles L. A. Clarke, and Jimmy J. Lin. *Dynamic Cutoff Prediction in Multi-Stage Retrieval Systems*. In Proceedings of the 21st Australasian Document Computing Symposium, ADCS 2016, Caulfield, VIC, Australia, December 5-7, 2016. ACM, 17–24. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3015026

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
