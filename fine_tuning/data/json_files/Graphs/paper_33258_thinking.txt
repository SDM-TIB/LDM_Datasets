To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Images of the M87* Black Hole Using GANs" by Arya Mohan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel data augmentation methodology and mentions that generated images are valuable for training deep learning algorithms, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the context of their work. They mention using General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations and refer to a "Simulation Library" and an "Image Library," indicating that these are likely datasets used in their research.

I will then look at **section 3 (Data)**, which is specifically dedicated to the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets, including the GRMHD simulated images and the parameters that characterize them. They mention that the dataset is labeled based on four key parameters: spin (𝑎∗), 𝑅high, frequency, and frame, which confirms the presence of a structured dataset.

In this section, they also describe the dataset structure, indicating that they created a dataset consisting of 101 frames for each simulation, allowing for a detailed analysis of image properties. This suggests that the dataset is extensive and well-defined.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) multiple times, which is crucial for citing the datasets accurately. The relevant citations include:

1. For the GRMHD simulations and the Simulation Library:
   > Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019a). *The First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole*. The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 875(1), L1.

2. For the Image Library:
   > Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019b). *The First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. II. Array and Instrumentation*. The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 875(1), L2.

3. For the GRMHD simulations:
   > Porth O., Olivares H., Mizuno Y., Younsi Z., Rezzolla L., Moscibrodzka M., Falcke H., Kramer M. (2017). *Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology*, 4(1), 1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
