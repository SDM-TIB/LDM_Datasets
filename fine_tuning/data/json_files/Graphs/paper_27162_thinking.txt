To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Camera-aware Proxies for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification" by Menglin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that extensive experiments were conducted on three large-scale Re-ID datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **experiments section**. They mention three datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 images of 1,501 identities captured by 6 disjoint cameras. It is split into training, query, and gallery sets.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: A subset of the DukeMTMC dataset, it includes 36,411 images of 1,812 identities captured by 8 cameras.

3. **MSMT17**: The largest dataset mentioned, it has 126,411 images of 4,101 identities captured in 15 camera views.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Z., Zheng, L., & Yang, Y. (2017). *Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identification baseline in vitro*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Wei, L., Zhang, S., Gao, W., & Tian, Q. (2018). *Person Transfer GAN to Bridge Domain Gap for Person Re-Identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets referenced in the paper.
