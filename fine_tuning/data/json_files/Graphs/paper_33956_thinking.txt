To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intra-Video Positive Pairs in Self-Supervised Learning for Ultrasound," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **POCUS dataset** for COVID-19 classification, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of labeled data in medical imaging and reference the **ParenchymalLUS dataset** for various ultrasound classification tasks. This suggests that both the POCUS and ParenchymalLUS datasets are significant for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors detail their experimental setup and explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. They describe the **POCUS dataset** as containing 140 ultrasound videos labeled for three classes related to COVID-19 pneumonia, and the **ParenchymalLUS dataset** as a larger dataset with 25,917 videos used for A-line vs. B-line classification and lung sliding classification tasks.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets' roles in the experiments. The authors report performance metrics for models trained on both datasets, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **POCUS Dataset**:
   > Jannis Born, Gabriel Brändle, Manuel Cossio, Marion Disdier, Julie Goulet, Jérémie Roulin, and Nina Wiedemann. *POCOVID-Net: Automatic Detection of COVID-19 From a New Lung Ultrasound Imaging Dataset (POCUS)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.12084, 2020.

2. **ParenchymalLUS Dataset**:
   > Deepa Anand, Pavan Annangi, and Prasad Sudhakar. *Benchmarking self-supervised representation learning from a million cardiac ultrasound images*. In 2022 44th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC), pages 529–532. IEEE, 2022.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include their full citations for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
