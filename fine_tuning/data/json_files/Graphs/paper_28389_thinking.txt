To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeanNet: Semantic Understanding Network for Localization Under Object Dynamics" by Xiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset that contains object dynamics, which indicates that there is at least one dataset relevant to the research. The introduction further emphasizes the need for robust localization under object-level dynamics, suggesting that datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe a **triplet dataset** used for training the SeanNet. They mention that this dataset consists of triplets (anchor, positive, negative) that help the network learn to distinguish between similar and dissimilar scenes based on object dynamics.

I will also check the **experimental results** section to confirm the dataset's application in the experiments. The authors state that they used a triplet dataset of 9.5k data points, which is crucial for understanding the scale and context of the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper references the **AI2THOR** simulation environment, which is used to validate the robustness of the SeanNet. The citation for this dataset is:

- **AI2THOR**: 
  > E. Kolve, R. Mottaghi, W. Han, E. VanderBilt, L. Weihs, A. Herrasti, D. Gordon, Y. Zhu, A. Gupta, and A. Farhadi. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. arXiv, 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention that the triplet dataset is constructed in a cascaded manner, but they do not provide a separate citation for this dataset since it is derived from their own experimental setup.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Triplet Dataset**: Contains 9.5k data points structured as triplets (anchor, positive, negative) for training the SeanNet.
2. **AI2THOR**: A simulation environment used for validating the SeanNet.

With this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing.
