To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Dialogue Generation via Multi-Level Contrastive Learning" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on a "carefully annotated dialogue dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 3) where the authors describe the dataset they built for their experiments. They state that they crawled **534,381 query-response pairs from Douban Group** and that human annotators provided multi-level quality labels for each sample. This is a significant detail that confirms the existence of a dataset.

In this section, they also specify how the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The training set consists of **522,881 query-response pairs**, the validation set has **10,000 pairs**, and the test set contains **1,500 pairs**. 

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset was crawled from Douban Group, a well-known forum in China. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself in the references section. Since the dataset is based on a specific source (Douban Group), I will note that as the source of the dataset.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dialogue Dataset**: This dataset consists of **534,381 query-response pairs** collected from Douban Group, annotated with multi-level quality labels. The dataset is split into training (522,881 pairs), validation (10,000 pairs), and testing (1,500 pairs) sets.

Since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset in the references, I will note the source as:
> Douban Group. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.douban.com/group/explore

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation details.
