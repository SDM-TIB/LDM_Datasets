To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Teacher Training" by Hui Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on two benchmark datasets: **Cityscapes** and **PASCAL VOC 2012**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of images used for training, validation, and testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset contains 5,000 images of urban traffic scenes, with 2,975 images for training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing. Each pixel in the images belongs to one of nineteen classes.
2. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset includes 10,582 images for training and 1,449 for validation, covering twenty-one classes, including a background class.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3213–3223.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Eslami, S. A., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2015). The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1), 98–136.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
