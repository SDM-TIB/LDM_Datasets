To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition" by Xinyi Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments" and "datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their methods on **three transductive datasets**: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Ogbn-arxiv**, as well as **two inductive datasets**: **Flickr** and **Reddit**. I will take note of these datasets and their characteristics.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features, which are usually provided in a table format. In this case, the paper includes a table (Table 6) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. This table provides valuable information that I will need to include in my dataset descriptions.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017, Conference Track Proceedings, 2017.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > William L. Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2017, December 4-9, 2017, Long Beach, CA, USA, pages 1024–1034, 2017.

3. **Ogbn-arxiv Dataset**:
   > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 33:22118–22133, 2020.

4. **Flickr Dataset**:
   > Hanqing Zeng, Hongkuan Zhou, Ajitesh Srivastava, Rajgopal Kannan, and Viktor K. Prasanna. *Graph-saint: Graph sampling based inductive learning method*. In 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, April 26-30, 2020. OpenReview.net, 2020.

5. **Reddit Dataset**:
   > Zhenbang Xiao, Yu Wang, Shunyu Liu, Huiqiong Wang, Mingli Song, and Tongya Zheng. *Simple graph condensation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.14951, 2024.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, including its characteristics and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and accurate, adhering to the requirements of the task.
