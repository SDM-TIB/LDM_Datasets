To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining COVID-19 Forecasting using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks" by Amol Kapoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on a **US county level COVID-19 dataset**, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **New York Times COVID-19 dataset**: This dataset includes daily reports of new infections and deaths at both state and county levels in the US. It is crucial for understanding the COVID-19 case dynamics.

2. **Google COVID-19 Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset**: This dataset aggregates weekly flows of users from region to region, providing insights into human mobility patterns during the pandemic.

3. **Google Community Mobility Reports**: This dataset summarizes mobility trends at various categories of places aggregated at the county level, helping to understand how mobility changes in response to the pandemic.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **New York Times COVID-19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > The New York Times. 2020. The New York Times COVID-19 Tracking Page. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html. (2020).

- For the **Google COVID-19 Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Google LLC. 2020. Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ (visited on 6/4/2020). (2020).

- For the **Google Community Mobility Reports**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same dataset.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their purpose and how they were used in the research, along with their full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
