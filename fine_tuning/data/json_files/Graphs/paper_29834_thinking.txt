To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interventional Contrastive Learning with Meta Semantic Regularizer" by Wenwen Qiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A small-scale dataset consisting of images of size 32 × 32 from 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but consists of 100 classes.
3. **STL-10**: Derived from ImageNet, this dataset contains over 100K training samples with a resolution of 96 × 96.
4. **Tiny ImageNet**: A simplified version of ImageNet with 100K training samples and 10K testing samples from 200 classes, with an image scale of 64 × 64.
5. **ImageNet**: A well-known large-scale dataset with about 1.3M training images and 50K test images across over 1000 classes.
6. **ImageNet-100**: A randomly sampled subset of ImageNet containing 100 classes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
