To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Graph Representation by Periphery and Hierarchical Information Maximization" by Sambaran Bandyopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on several real-world graph datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find a table (Table 2) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics:

1. **MUTAG**: Contains 188 graphs, with a maximum of 28 nodes, 2 labels, and no attributes.
2. **PTC**: Contains 344 graphs, with a maximum of 64 nodes, 2 labels, and no attributes.
3. **PROTEINS**: Contains 1113 graphs, with a maximum of 620 nodes, 2 labels, and 29 attributes.
4. **NCI1**: Contains 4110 graphs, with a maximum of 111 nodes, 2 labels, and no attributes.
5. **NCI109**: Contains 4127 graphs, with a maximum of 111 nodes, 2 labels, and no attributes.
6. **IMDB-BINARY**: Contains 1000 graphs, with a maximum of 136 nodes, 2 labels, and no attributes.
7. **IMDB-MULTI**: Contains 1500 graphs, with a maximum of 89 nodes, 3 labels, and no attributes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset used, as they are commonly known datasets in the field of graph representation learning.

For the datasets mentioned, I will provide the following citations based on common knowledge in the field:

  > Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. V. N. (2015). "Deep graph kernels." *Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
