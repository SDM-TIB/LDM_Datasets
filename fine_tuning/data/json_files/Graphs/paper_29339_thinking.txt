To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SELF-SUPERVISED VIDEO REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH MOTION-CONTRASTIVE PERCEPTION" by Jinyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list four datasets:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset contains 400 human action categories and approximately 240,000 training video clips and 20,000 validation video clips. It is used for self-supervised pre-training.

2. **Kinetics-100**: A subset of Kinetics-400, this dataset consists of 100 classes and is used in ablation studies to reduce training costs.

3. **UCF-101**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos from 101 human action classes and is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

4. **HMDB-51**: This dataset contains about 7,000 video clips of 51 different human motion classes and is also used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Kinetics-100**, the citation is:
  > Chen Sun, Austin Myers, and Andrew Zisserman. *RSPNet: Relative speed perception for unsupervised video representation learning*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021.

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB-51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garofalo, J., & Black, M. J. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
