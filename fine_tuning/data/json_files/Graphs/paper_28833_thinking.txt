To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Estimation in Electric Power Systems Leveraging Graph Neural Networks" by Ognjen Kundacina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use synthetic datasets created from PMU measurements, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or methodologies for generating these datasets that I need to explore further.

Next, I will examine **section V (Numerical Results)**, where the authors describe the training setup and the datasets used for training, validation, and testing. They mention that the datasets are based on the IEEE 30-bus test case, which is a well-known benchmark in power systems research. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the foundational dataset used in their experiments.

In this section, the authors specify that the training set consists of 10,000 samples, while the validation and test sets each contain 100 samples. They also mention that these datasets are enriched by adding Gaussian noise to the exact power flow solutions, which is important for understanding the nature of the datasets.

Now, I will look for any references to the original source of the IEEE 30-bus test case in the **References section**. The IEEE 30-bus test case is a standard dataset in power systems, and I need to ensure I provide the correct citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the IEEE 30-bus test case is commonly cited in power systems literature, but the specific citation may not be included in this paper. Therefore, I will use a widely accepted citation for the IEEE 30-bus test case:

- For the **IEEE 30-bus test case**, the citation is:
  > "IEEE Power and Energy Society. *IEEE 30-bus test case*. Available: https://www2.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/".

Since the authors also mention the use of synthetic datasets generated from PMU measurements, I will note that these datasets are not publicly available and are generated specifically for the experiments described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned, particularly the IEEE 30-bus test case, and summarize the synthetic datasets as generated data without a specific citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
