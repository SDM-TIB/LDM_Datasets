To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geo-Context Aware Study of Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Models and Spatial Video Data" by Suphanut Jamonnak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of "large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets" for training autonomous driving models, indicating that datasets are indeed a focus of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Vision Based Autonomous Driving Models)**, where the authors discuss the need for large-scale spatial video datasets for training and evaluation. Here, they mention the **Berkeley DeepDrive Video (BDDV)** dataset, which is described as one of the largest datasets available, containing over 10,000 hours of road videos across various environments and conditions.

In **section 4.1 (Video Trips and Data Extraction)**, the authors provide details about the BDDV dataset, including its size (approximately 250GB) and the number of video trips (12,000) used in their system. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BDDV dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, F., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2020). BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2020.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several other datasets in the context of autonomous driving, such as **KITTI**, **Cityscape**, **Comma.ai**, and **Oxford**. However, they do not provide detailed descriptions or citations for these datasets in the same way they do for the BDDV dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
