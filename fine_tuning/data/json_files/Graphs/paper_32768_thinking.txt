To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-level Representation Learning with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures" by Geri Skenderi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "multiple experimental evaluations" and "various graph datasets," which suggests that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental setting)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. They mention seven different graph-classification datasets:

1. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein classification.
2. **MUTAG**: A dataset for mutagenicity prediction.
3. **DD**: A dataset for drug discovery.
4. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A dataset for binary classification of Reddit posts.
5. **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**: A dataset for multi-class classification of Reddit posts.
6. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset for binary classification of IMDB movie reviews.
7. **IMDB-MULTI**: A dataset for multi-class classification of IMDB movie reviews.
8. **ZINC**: A dataset for molecular graph regression.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide full citations for all datasets, especially if they are well-known or publicly available datasets. However, I will look for any specific papers or sources they reference.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper and any additional sources I can find:

- **PROTEINS**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.
  
- **MUTAG**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **DD**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **REDDIT-BINARY**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **IMDB-BINARY**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **IMDB-MULTI**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- **ZINC**: Morris, C., et al. (2020). "TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs." In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
