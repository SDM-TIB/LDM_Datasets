To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Resilient Radio Resource Management Policies with Graph Neural Networks" by Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Mark Eisen, and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific characteristics or configurations relevant to their experiments.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **numerical evaluations** or **performance comparisons** that might indicate the datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Wireless Power Control Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is from a specific study or a publicly available resource, I will ensure to include the complete citation format as follows:

- Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Conference/Journal. URL (if applicable).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
