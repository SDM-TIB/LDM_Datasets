To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergent Boosted Smoothing on Graphs with Tabular Node Features" by Jiuhai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various non-iid graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **House Dataset**: This dataset consists of nodes representing properties, with edges connecting neighboring properties. The target variable is the price of the house.

2. **County Dataset**: In this dataset, each node represents a county, and edges connect counties that share borders. The target variable is the unemployment rate for each county.

3. **VK Dataset**: This dataset consists of nodes representing people, with edges connecting individuals based on friendships. The target variable is the age of each person.

4. **Avazu Dataset**: Here, nodes represent devices, and edges connect devices that appear on the same site with the same application. The target variable is the click-through rate of each device.

5. **DBLP Dataset**: In this dataset, nodes represent authors, papers, and conferences, with the goal of predicting one of the classes (database, data mining, information retrieval, and machine learning).

6. **SLAP Dataset**: This dataset includes nodes representing network bioinformatics entities such as chemical compounds, genes, and pathways, with the goal of predicting one of 15 gene types.

7. **Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Phy Datasets**: These datasets consist of authors as nodes, with edges connecting co-authors. The node features represent paper keywords, and the goal is to predict the fields of study for each author.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are likely well-known datasets in the field.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset, along with their respective citations where applicable. Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, I will note that they are commonly referenced in the literature.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for further processing or review.
