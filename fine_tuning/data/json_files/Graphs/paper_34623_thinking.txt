To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring User Retrieval Integration towards Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation" by Tingjia Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **Movie-Game** and **Art-Office**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used, including the number of items, training, validation, and test samples, as well as the average length of interactions. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are publicly available from the Amazon platform, and it cites two specific works that detail the preprocessing of these datasets:

1. For the **Movie-Game dataset**, the citation is:
   > Keqin Bao, Jizhi Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Yang Zhang, Zhengyi Yang, Yancheng Luo, Chong Chen, Fuli Feng, and Qi Tian. *A Bi-Step Grounding Paradigm for Large Language Models in Recommendation Systems*. arXiv:2308.08434 [cs.IR], 2023.

2. For the **Art-Office dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yupeng Hou, Shanlei Mu, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, and Ji-Rong Wen. *Towards Universal Sequence Representation Learning for Recommender Systems*. In KDD ’22: The 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Washington, DC, USA, August 14 - 18, 2022. ACM, 585–593. https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539381.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
