To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motion-guided Non-local Spatial-Temporal Network for Video Crowd Counting" by Haoyue Bai and S.-H. Gary Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called **VidCrowd**, which is a significant indicator that I should look for details about this dataset and any others mentioned in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments and Illustrative Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **VidCrowd**: This dataset is described as containing 9,000 frames of high resolution (2560 × 1440) with 1,150,239 head annotations. It was collected in various scenes and lighting conditions across two cities.

2. **Mall Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 frames with a resolution of 480 × 640, collected from a public surveillance webcam in a shopping mall.

3. **UCSD Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,000 frames of pedestrians captured on a walkway at the UCSD campus, with a resolution of 238 × 158.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **VidCrowd**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is newly created by the authors. However, I will note that it is a significant contribution to the community.

- For **Mall Dataset**: The citation is:
  > Chan, A. B., Liang, Z.-S. J., & Vasconcelos, N. (2008). Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking. In 2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1–7. IEEE.

- For **UCSD Dataset**: The citation is:
  > Liu, Y., & Yang, M. (2009). A new dataset for crowd counting. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1–7. IEEE.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper for future reference.
