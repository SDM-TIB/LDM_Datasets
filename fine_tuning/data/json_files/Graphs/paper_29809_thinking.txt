To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLIC: Self-Supervised Learning with Iterative Clustering for Human Action Videos" by Salar Hosseini Khorasgani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF101 and HMDB51, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I expect to find explicit mentions of the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos spanning 101 action classes. It is widely used for action recognition tasks.
2. **HMDB51**: This dataset contains 7,000 videos across 51 action categories, also commonly used for evaluating action recognition methods.
3. **Kinetics400**: This dataset includes 222,454 training videos in 400 action classes, used for self-supervised pretraining.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio, and T. Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556â€“2563, 2011.

- For **Kinetics400**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, Mustafa Suleyman, and Andrew Zisserman. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
