To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power-of-Two Quantization for Low Bitwidth and Hardware Compliant Neural Networks" by Dominika Przewlocka-Rus et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention testing their Quantization Aware Training (QAT) algorithms on three datasets: **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors provide results for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, indicating that they used the ResNet18 architecture for their experiments. In **subsection 4.2**, they discuss the results for the ImageNet dataset, which is another significant dataset used in their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet are well-known datasets, I can provide their standard citations based on existing literature:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. **CIFAR100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images categorized into over 20,000 classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
