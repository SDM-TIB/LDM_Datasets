To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Synthetic Characters for Military Training" by Volkan Ustun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of synthetic characters and mentions a simulation environment called RIDE, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for adaptive synthetic characters in military training simulations. They mention the use of a Unity-based simulation environment and the One World Terrain (OWT) models, which suggests that OWT may be a dataset or a collection of datasets used in their research.

In the **RAPID INTEGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (RIDE)** section, the authors describe RIDE as integrating various capabilities, including One World Terrain data sets generated from photogrammetric data captures of real-world military bases. This indicates that the OWT dataset is indeed a significant dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **proof-of-concept models** section, where they mention using scenarios created in NeuralMMO and RIDE. This suggests that both NeuralMMO and RIDE are relevant datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **One World Terrain (OWT)**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for OWT, but it is described as a dataset generated from photogrammetric data captures of real-world military bases. I will note that it is a dataset used in their research but may not have a formal citation.

2. **Neural MMO**: The citation for Neural MMO is:
   > Suarez, J., Du, Y., Isola, P., & Mordatch, I. (2019). Neural MMO: A Massively Multiagent Game Environment for Training and Evaluating Intelligent Agents. arXiv:1903.00784v1.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **One World Terrain (OWT)**: A dataset generated from real-world military base captures, used in the RIDE simulation environment.
- **Neural MMO**: A game environment for training and evaluating intelligent agents.

Finally, I will compile these datasets into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable.
