To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accel-GCN: High-Performance GPU Accelerator Design for Graph Convolution Networks" by Xi Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of Accel-GCN across 18 benchmark graphs, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section IV (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, there is a table (Table I) that lists various graph datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes and edges. This table is crucial as it directly provides the datasets I need to extract.

The datasets mentioned in the table include:

1. **am**: 
   - Nodes: 881,680
   - Edges: 5,668,682

2. **Arxiv**: 
   - Nodes: 169,343
   - Edges: 1,166,243

3. **com-amazon**: 
   - Nodes: 334,863
   - Edges: 1,851,744

4. **Pubmed**: 
   - Nodes: 19,717
   - Edges: 99,203

5. **SW-620H**: 
   - Nodes: 1,888,584
   - Edges: 3,944,206

6. **Yelp**: 
   - Nodes: 716,847
   - Edges: 13,954,819

7. **amazon0601**: 
   - Nodes: 403,394
   - Edges: 5,478,357

8. **Citation**: 
   - Nodes: 2,927,963
   - Edges: 30,387,995

9. **OVCAR-8H**: 
   - Nodes: 1,889,542
   - Edges: 3,946,402

10. **PPA**: 
    - Nodes: 576,289
    - Edges: 42,463,862

11. **TWITTER-Partial**: 
    - Nodes: 580,768
    - Edges: 1,435,116

12. **Yeast**: 
    - Nodes: 1,710,902
    - Edges: 3,636,546

13. **Artist**: 
    - Nodes: 50,515
    - Edges: 1,638,396

14. **Collab**: 
    - Nodes: 235,868
    - Edges: 2,358,104

15. **PRODUCTS**: 
    - Nodes: 2,449,029
    - Edges: 123,718,280

16. **Reddit**: 
    - Nodes: 232,965
    - Edges: 114,615,891

17. **wikikg2**: 
    - Nodes: 2,500,604
    - Edges: 16,109,182

18. **youtube**: 
    - Nodes: 1,138,499
    - Edges: 5,980,886

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the datasets' original publications or sources.

For example, the citation for the **am** dataset might be:
> Rossi, R. A., & Ahmed, N. K. (2015). The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization. In AAAI.

I will repeat this process for each dataset listed in the table to ensure I have the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
