To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task Allocation for Asynchronous Mobile Edge Learning with Delay and Energy Constraints" by Umair Mohammad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Simulation Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training their machine learning model. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In the **simulation environment subsection**, the authors provide details about the MNIST dataset, including its size and features. They state that the MNIST dataset consists of **60,000 images** with **784 features** (28x28 pixels). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998. Available: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/726791.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MNIST dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
