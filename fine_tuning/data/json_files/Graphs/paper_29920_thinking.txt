To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prototypical Contrast Adaptation for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation" by Zhengkai Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on domain adaptation tasks, specifically referencing **GTA5 → Cityscapes** and **SYNTHIA → Cityscapes** as the benchmarks used for evaluation. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **GTA5**: This dataset is described as an image dataset synthesized from a photo-realistic open-world computer game. It contains 24,966 images with a resolution of 1914 × 1052 pixels.

2. **SYNTHIA**: The authors refer to the subset **SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES**, which shares 16 common classes with Cityscapes. This subset contains 9,400 images with a resolution of 1280 × 760 pixels.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of real urban scenes collected from 50 cities in Germany and neighboring countries. It includes 2,975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1,525 test images, all with a resolution of 2048 × 1024 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **GTA5**, the citation is:
  > Richter, S.R., Vineet, V., Roth, S., Koltun, V. "Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 102–118, 2016.

- For **SYNTHIA**, the citation is:
  > Ros, G., Sellart, L., Materzynska, J., Vazquez, D., Lopez, A.M. "The SYNTHIA dataset: A large collection of synthetic images for semantic segmentation of urban scenes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3234–3243, 2016.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. "The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
