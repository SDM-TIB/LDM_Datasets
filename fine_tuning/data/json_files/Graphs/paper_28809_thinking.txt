To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Learning from 100 Million Medical Images" by Florin C. Ghesu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage large datasets of over 100 million medical images, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for self-supervised training. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **2D X-ray dataset (DX)**: This dataset contains 1,297,699 X-ray images capturing various anatomies, including chest, spine, back, arm, and leg. The data is sourced from both public and internal sources.

2. **2D mixed modality dataset (DM)**: This dataset consists of 105,006,320 images/slices from various anatomies and imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray. It is primarily composed of internal data, with a small portion from public sources.

3. **3D computed tomography (CT) dataset (DCT)**: This dataset includes 24,440 3D CT volumes derived from 1,345,040 DICOM slices of non-contrast CT head scans, all sourced from internal data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **2D X-ray dataset (DX)**, the citation is:
> Armato III, S. G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M. F., Meyer, C. R., Reeves, A. P., Zhao, B., Aberle, D. R., Henschke, C. I., & Hoffman, E. A. (2011). The lung image database consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI): a completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans. *Medical Physics*, 38(2), 915-931.

For the **2D mixed modality dataset (DM)**, the citation is:
> Bustos, A., Pertusa, A., Salinas, J.-M., & de la Iglesia-VayÃ¡, M. (2020). Padchest: A large chest x-ray image dataset with multi-label annotated reports. *Medical Image Analysis*, 66, 101797.

For the **3D computed tomography (CT) dataset (DCT)**, the citation is:
> Ghesu, F. C., Georgescu, B., Mansoor, A., Yoo, Y., Gibson, E., Vishwanath, R., Balter, J. M., Cao, Y., & Comaniciu, D. (2021). Quantifying and leveraging predictive uncertainty for medical image assessment. *Medical Image Analysis*, 68, 101855.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
