To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Spatial-Structural Diversity Reasoning" by Feifei Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method, SSDR-AL, is evaluated on two point cloud benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets utilized:

1. **S3DIS Dataset**: This dataset contains 271 rooms divided into 6 large areas, with each room corresponding to a point cloud containing medium-sized 3D points. It includes 10 room types and 13 point categories, making it suitable for various point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.

2. **Semantic3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15 point clouds and 8 classes for training. It is noted for having a significantly larger number of points per point cloud compared to S3DIS, with each point cloud containing up to 108 points.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **S3DIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Sasha Sax, Amir R Zamir, and Silvio Savarese. *Joint 2d-3d-semantic data for indoor scene understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.01105, 2017.

- For the **Semantic3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Timo Hackel, N. Savinov, L. Ladicky, Jan D. Wegner, K. Schindler, and M. Pollefeys. *SEMANTIC3D.NET: A new large-scale point cloud classification benchmark*. In ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
