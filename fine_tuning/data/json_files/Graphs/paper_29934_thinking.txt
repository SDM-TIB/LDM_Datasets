To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RT-KGD: Relation Transition Aware Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation" by Kexin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a multi-domain knowledge-driven dialogue dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **KdConv dataset**, which is a Chinese multi-domain knowledge-driven dialogue dataset. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of dialogues and utterances, as well as the domains it covers (film, music, and travel).

In this section, the authors state that KdConv contains 4.5K dialogues and 86K utterances, with an average of 19.0 turns and 10.1 triplets per dialogue. This detailed description confirms that KdConv is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KdConv dataset. The citation provided is:
> Zhou, H., Zheng, C., Huang, K., Huang, M., Zhu, X. (2020). *KdConv: A Chinese multi-domain dialogue dataset towards multi-turn knowledge-driven conversation*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

Since KdConv is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
