To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pushing the Limits of Deep CNNs for Pedestrian Detection" by Qichang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved a new record on the **Caltech pedestrian dataset** and achieved comparable results on the **KITTI dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are significant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **section 1.3 (Datasets, Evaluation metric and Models)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Caltech Pedestrian Dataset**: This dataset contains 250,000 frames extracted from 10 hours of urban traffic video, with 350,000 annotated bounding boxes for 2,300 unique pedestrians. The authors note that they used an extended training set for their experiments.

2. **KITTI Pedestrian Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,481 training images and 7,518 test images, with over 80,000 annotated objects in traffic scenes. The authors specify that they used the Moderate training subset for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Caltech Pedestrian Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dollar, P., Wojek, C., Schiele, B., & Perona, P. (2012). Pedestrian detection: An evaluation of the state of the art. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 34(4), 743â€“761.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
