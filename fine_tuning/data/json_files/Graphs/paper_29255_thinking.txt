To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Vision-Language Parsing: Seamlessly Bridging Visual Scene Graphs with Language Structures via Dependency Relationships" by Chao Lou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new dataset called **VLParse**, which is a strong lead for my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The VLParse Dataset)**, where the authors describe how the VLParse dataset is formed. They mention that it is created using a semi-automatic process that involves automatic alignment followed by human refinement. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and the number of images and captions included.

In **section 3.4**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset, indicating that it includes **850 images and 4,250 captions**. This section also mentions that the dataset is derived from the **MSCOCO training dataset** and annotated based on the intersection of the MSCOCO dev/test datasets and **Visual Genome**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **VLParse Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for VLParse since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is a product of their research.

2. **MSCOCO Dataset**: The citation for the MSCOCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, Cham, 2014.

3. **Visual Genome Dataset**: The citation for the Visual Genome dataset is:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalanatidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, Michael S. Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, May 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for MSCOCO and Visual Genome, while noting that VLParse is a new dataset introduced in this paper without a separate citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
