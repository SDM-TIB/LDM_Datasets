To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive CSI Representation Learning for Massive MIMO Positioning" by Junquan Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a "real-world CSI dataset," which suggests that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention that the CSI measurements were taken from a "real outdoor massive MIMO dataset provided by IEEE Communications Theory Workshop data competition." This is a key detail that indicates the dataset's source.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **IEEE Communications Theory Workshop dataset**, the citation is:
  > IEEE CTW 2020 Challenge. "IEEE CTW 2020 Challenge," https://data.ieeemlc.org/Ds4Detail, 2020.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset's origin and access.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Real-world CSI Dataset**: This dataset consists of channel state information (CSI) measurements collected in a residential area, which includes 4979 labeled CSI measurements with corresponding GPS locations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
