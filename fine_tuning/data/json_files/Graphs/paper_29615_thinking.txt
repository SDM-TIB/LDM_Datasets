To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On EDA-Driven Learning for SAT Solving" by Min Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, DeepSAT, and hints at the use of various SAT problems, which suggests that datasets related to SAT instances may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention generating random k-SAT CNF pairs for training, specifically referring to the dataset as **SR(3-10)**, which consists of 230,000 SAT and UNSAT pairs. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors compare their method against NeuroSAT and mention various SAT problems, but the primary dataset remains the SR(3-10) dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the SR(3-10) dataset is generated based on a specific scheme proposed in NeuroSAT, I will refer to the original NeuroSAT paper for its citation:

- For the **SR(3-10) dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Selsam, M. Lamm, B. BÃ¼nz, P. Liang, L. de Moura, and D. L. Dill. *Learning a SAT solver from single-bit supervision*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
