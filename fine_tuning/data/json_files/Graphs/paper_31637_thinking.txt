To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BCE-Net: Reliable Building Footprints Change Extraction based on Historical Map and Up-to-Date Images using Contrastive Learning" by Cheng Liaoa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Wuhan University building change detection dataset** and a newly established dataset named **SI-BU**. This suggests that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4.1 (Description of datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **SI-BU Dataset**: This dataset consists of post-phase satellite imagery captured from Google Earth in 2021, along with corresponding labels that were annotated by experts. It covers approximately 172 km² with a resolution of 0.5-0.8 m and includes various building types and urbanization levels. The dataset is designed to address the challenges of building change detection, particularly the oﬀ-nadir problem.

2. **WHU-CD Dataset**: This dataset includes bi-temporal aerial images from 2012 and 2016, with corresponding building masks and change labels at a resolution of 0.3 m. It provides a total of 1,260 training tiles and 690 testing tiles, which can be converted into single temporal forms for analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SI-BU dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in detail in the paper itself.
  
- For the **WHU-CD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, S., Wei, S., Lu, M. (2018). Fully convolutional networks for multisource building extraction from an open aerial and satellite imagery data set. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 57, 574–586.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
