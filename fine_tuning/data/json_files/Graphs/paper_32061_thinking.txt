To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Heart Disease from Multi-View Ultrasound Images via Supervised Attention Multiple Instance Learning" by Zhe Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an open-access dataset for their experiments, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they describe the **Tufts Medical Echocardiogram Dataset (TMED)**, which is crucial for their research. They mention that TMED is a collection of 2D echocardiogram images gathered from routine care at Tufts Medical Center, and they provide specifics about the dataset's composition, including the number of studies and images.

The authors also mention a **2022-Validation dataset**, which consists of additional deidentified images collected during 2022 for further evaluation. This dataset is also important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The TMED dataset is cited as follows:
- **Tufts Medical Echocardiogram Dataset (TMED)**:
  > Zhe Huang, Gary Long, Benjamin Wessler, and Michael C. Hughes. *TMED 2: A dataset for semi-supervised classification of echocardiograms*. In DataPerf: Benchmarking Data for Data-Centric AI Workshop at ICML, 2022.

For the **2022-Validation dataset**, the authors do not provide a separate citation since it is derived from the same institution and context as TMED, but I will note that it is an additional dataset used for validation purposes.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
