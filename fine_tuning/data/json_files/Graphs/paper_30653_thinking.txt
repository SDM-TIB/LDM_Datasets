To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Graph Structure Refinement for Graph Neural Networks" by Jianan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on six benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will note this down as a key point.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some statistics about each one. I will carefully extract the names and descriptions of these datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Cora**: A citation graph dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation graph dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,552 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **Air-USA**: A graph representing air traffic with 1,190 nodes, 13,599 edges, and 4 classes.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset with 5,196 nodes, 171,743 edges, and 6 classes.
5. **Flickr**: Another social network dataset with 7,575 nodes, 239,738 edges, and 9 classes.
6. **ogbn-arxiv**: A large-scale citation graph with 169,343 nodes, 1,157,799 edges, and 40 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. 

For the datasets, I will look for the following citations:

- **Cora**: 
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. 2017. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In ICLR.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > David Lewis and William Gale. 1994. *A Sequential Algorithm for Training Text Classifiers*. In SIGIR.

- **Air-USA**: 
  > Jun Wu, Jingrui He, and Jiejun Xu. 2019. *Net: Degree-specific graph neural networks for node and graph classification*. In KDD.

- **BlogCatalog**: 
  > Xiao Huang, Jundong Li, and Xia Hu. 2017. *Label informed attributed network embedding*. In WSDM.

- **Flickr**: 
  > Jundong Li, Xiao Huang, and Xia Hu. 2017. *Social recommendation with graph neural networks*. In WWW.

- **ogbn-arxiv**: 
  > Wenjie Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, and Jure Leskovec. 2020. *ogbn-arxiv: A large-scale benchmark for graph neural networks*. In KDD.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
