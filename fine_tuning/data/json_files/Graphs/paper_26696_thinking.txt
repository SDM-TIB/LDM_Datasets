To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplification of Graph Convolutional Networks: A Matrix Factorization-based Perspective" by Qiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments have been conducted on several real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention evaluating their proposed model on five real-world datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, BlogCatalog, and Flickr**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The paper mentions that:

1. **Cora**: A standard citation network benchmark dataset widely used in previous works.
2. **Citeseer**: Another standard citation network benchmark dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset that is also commonly used in research.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset where posted keywords or tags are used as node features.
5. **Flickr**: Another social network dataset similar to BlogCatalog.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > Huang, X., Li, J., & Hu, X. (2017). Label informed attributed network embedding. In *Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining*, 731-739. ACM.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is the same as for BlogCatalog since both datasets are discussed together:
  > Huang, X., Li, J., & Hu, X. (2017). Label informed attributed network embedding. In *Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining*, 731-739. ACM.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
