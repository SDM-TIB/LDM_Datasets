To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BGC: Multi-Agent Group Belief with Graph Clustering" by Tianze Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on the **SMAC benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that their method is evaluated on several unit micromanagement tasks based on **StarCraft II**. This indicates that the **StarCraft II** environment is a dataset or benchmark used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, they detail the scenarios tested, including various maps like **5m vs 6m**, **8m vs 9m**, **10m vs 11m**, **12m vs 14m**, and **15m vs 17m**. These scenarios are part of the **SMAC benchmark**, which is derived from the **StarCraft II** game.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SMAC benchmark** and any other datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the **StarCraft II** benchmark is:

- For **StarCraft II** and the **SMAC benchmark**, the citation is:

S., Yeo, M., Makhzani, A., Kuttler, H., Agapiou, J., Schrittwieser, J., Quan, J., Gaffney, S., Petersen, S., Simonyan, K., Schaul, T., van Hasselt, H., Silver, D., Lillicrap, T. P., Calderone, K., Keet, P., Brunasso, A., Lawrence, D., Ekermo, A., Repp, J., and Tsing, R. (2017). *StarCraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning*. CoRR abs/1708.04782. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04782.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the guidelines provided. This will include the **SMAC benchmark** as derived from **StarCraft II**.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted for future reference or processing.
