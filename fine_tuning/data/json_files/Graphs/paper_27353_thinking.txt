To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIST: Distributed Training for Large-Scale Graph Convolutional Networks" by Cameron R. Wolfe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on **Section 5 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In **Appendix A (Experimental Details)**, the authors provide a table (Table 5) that lists the datasets used in the experiments, including their sizes and other relevant details. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 labels, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 4,723 edges, 6 labels, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset consisting of 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 labels, and 500 features.
4. **OGBN-Arxiv**: A larger dataset with 169,343 nodes, 1.2 million edges, 40 labels, and 128 features.
5. **Reddit**: A social network dataset with 232,965 nodes and 11.6 million edges, containing 41 labels and 602 features.
6. **Amazon2M**: A large-scale dataset with 2.5 million nodes, 61.8 million edges, 47 labels, and 100 features.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for each dataset, but I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **Cora**:

- **Citeseer**:

- **Pubmed**:

- **OGBN-Arxiv**:

- **Reddit**:

- **Amazon2M**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
