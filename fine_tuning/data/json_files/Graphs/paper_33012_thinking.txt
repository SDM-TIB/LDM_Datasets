To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding in Recommender Systems: A Survey" by Xiangyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **main body of the paper**, focusing on sections that typically discuss datasets, such as the **methodology, experiments, and results** sections. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the context of the research.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will record the name of the dataset and any details provided about it.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is presented in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
