To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Dynamic Multiple-Graph Attention" by Wei Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss various spatio-temporal prediction tasks and mention the importance of accurate forecasting, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Moving on to **section 3 (Experiments)**, I will focus on the subsections that describe the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Melbourne Parking Dataset**: This dataset was collected by the Melbourne City Council in 2019 and contains 42,672,743 parking events recorded by in-ground sensors every five minutes in the Melbourne Central Business District (CBD). 

2. **Air Quality Dataset**: This dataset was published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China (MEE) and comprises data from 92 air quality monitoring stations assessing hourly PM2.5 concentration in Jiangsu province in 2020.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, confirming their relevance to the study. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Melbourne Parking Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei Shao, Flora D Salim, Tao Gu, Ngoc-Thanh Dinh, and Jeffrey Chan. *Traveling Officer Problem: Managing Car Parking Violations Efficiently Using Sensor Data*. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5(2):802–810, 2017.

- For the **Air Quality Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shuo Wang, Yanran Li, Jiang Zhang, Qingye Meng, Lingwei Meng, and Fei Gao. *PM2.5-GNN: A Domain Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Network for PM2.5 Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, SIGSPATIAL ’20, pages 163–166, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
