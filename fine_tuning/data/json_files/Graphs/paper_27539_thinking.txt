To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GKD: Semi-supervised Graph Knowledge Distillation for Graph-Independent Inference" by Mahsa Ghorbani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details and citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on two public datasets for diagnosing Autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention the **ABIDE dataset** for Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of patients (1112) and the binary labels indicating the presence of diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). They also specify that they used a subset of 871 patients for their experiments.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **TADPOLE dataset**, which is used for predicting Alzheimer’s disease progression. They describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of instances (151 with diagnosis or progression and 1878 who maintain their status) and the features used for the analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ABIDE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Di Martino, A., Yan, C.G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F.X., Alaerts, K., Anderson, J.S., Assaf, M., Bookheimer, S.Y., Dapretto, M., et al. *The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism*. Molecular psychiatry 19(6), 659–667, 2014.

2. For the **TADPOLE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marinescu, R.V., Oxtoby, N.P., Young, A.L., Bron, E.E., Toga, A.W., Weiner, M.W., Barkhof, F., Fox, N.C., Klein, S., Alexander, D.C., et al. *Tadpole challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer’s disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This will prepare me to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
