To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASGN: An Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction" by Zhongkai Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of molecular property prediction and hints at the datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets in section 5.1 (Datasets):

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains the equilibrium coordinates of 130,000 molecules along with their quantum mechanical properties. The authors specify that they used 10,000 molecules for testing and 10,000 for validation, with properties calculated using DFT methods.

2. **OPV Dataset**: This dataset consists of roughly 100,000 medium-sized molecules, each containing 20 to 30 heavy atoms. Similar to QM9, the properties and equilibrium coordinates are obtained through DFT, with 5,000 molecules used for testing and 5,000 for validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The QM9 dataset is cited as follows:
- Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. "Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules." *Scientific Data* 1 (2014): 140022.

The OPV dataset is cited as:
- Peter C St. John, Caleb Phillips, Travis W Kemper, A Nolan Wilson, Yanfei Guan, Michael F Crowley, Mark R Nimlos, and Ross E Larsen. "Message-passing neural networks for high-throughput polymer screening." *The Journal of Chemical Physics* 150, no. 23 (2019): 234111.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
