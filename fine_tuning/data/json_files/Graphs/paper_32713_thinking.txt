To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A class-weighted supervised contrastive learning long-tailed bearing fault diagnosis approach using quadratic neural network" by Wei-En Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for validation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they validate their method using both **public and proprietary datasets**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Computational experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing faults dataset**: This dataset is widely used in bearing fault diagnosis research. It was collected by the Bearing Data Center at Case Western Reserve University and includes vibration data from bearings with various fault types.

2. **Our bearing dataset**: This dataset was collected by the authors using angular contact ball bearings (HC7003) and includes vibration signals generated by bearings with induced faults of varying severity.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CWRU dataset is well-known, and its citation can be found in the literature. The authors may also provide a citation for their proprietary dataset if it has been previously published.

For the **CWRU bearing faults dataset**, the citation is:
> Smith, W. A., & Randall, R. B. (2015). Rolling element bearing diagnostics using the Case Western Reserve University data: A benchmark study. *Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing*, 64, 100-131.

For **our bearing dataset**, since it is proprietary and collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is described in detail in the paper itself.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I provide complete and accurate references for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
