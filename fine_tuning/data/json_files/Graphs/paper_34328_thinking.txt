To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Boundary Segmentation for Topological Accuracy with Skeleton-based Methods" by Chuni Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across three different boundary segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the **experiments section (4)** explicitly lists three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SNEMI3D**: This dataset is described as consisting of electron microscopy images for segmenting mouse cortex neurites in 3D, with a size of 100 × 1024 × 1024. 

2. **Pure Iron Grain (IRON)**: This dataset focuses on pure iron grain segmentation in material science and comprises 296 microscopic slices, each with an image size of 1024 × 1024.

3. **Massachusetts Roads Dataset (MASS. ROAD)**: This dataset contains 1171 aerial images of Massachusetts, each sized 1500 × 1500 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **SNEMI3D**, the citation is:
  > Ignacio Arganda-Carreras, H. Sebastian Seung, Ashwin Vishwanathan, and Daniel R. Berger. *Snemi3d: 3d segmentation of neurites in em images (isbi 2013)*. https://snemi3d.grand-challenge.org/, 2013. Accessed: 2023-08-13.

- For **Pure Iron Grain (IRON)**, the citation is:
  > Wei Liu, Jiahao Chen, Chuni Liu, Xiaojuan Ban, Boyuan Ma, Hao Wang, Weihua Xue, and Yu Guo. *Boundary learning by using weighted propagation in convolution network*. Journal of Computational Science, 62:101709, 2022.

- For **Massachusetts Roads Dataset (MASS. ROAD)**, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih. *Machine learning for aerial image labeling*. University of Toronto (Canada), 2013.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
