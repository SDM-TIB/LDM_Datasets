To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViCGCN: Graph Convolutional Network with Contextualized Language Models for Social Media Mining in Vietnamese" by Chau-Thang Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various Vietnamese benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Analysis)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UIT-VSMEC**: This dataset consists of 6,927 sentences annotated with emotions for Vietnamese social media comments, categorized into seven emotion types: Enjoyment, Disgust, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, and Other.

2. **UIT-VSFC**: This dataset contains 16,000 sentences used for sentiment analysis and topic classification, with three sentiment classes (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and four topic categories (Lecturer, Curriculum, Facility, Others).

3. **UIT-ViCTSD**: This dataset includes 10,000 human-annotated comments categorized into two tasks: constructiveness and toxicity, with binary classifications for each task (constructive/non-constructive and toxic/non-toxic).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **UIT-VSMEC**, the citation is:
  > Ho, V. A., Nguyen, D. H.-C., Nguyen, D. H., Pham, L. T.-V., Nguyen, D.-V., Nguyen, K. V., & Nguyen, N. L.-T. (2020). Emotion recognition for Vietnamese social media text. In L.-M. Nguyen, X.-H. Phan, K. Hasida, & S. Tojo (Eds.), *Computational Linguistics* (pp. 319–333). Springer Singapore. doi:10.1007/978-981-15-6168-9_27.

- For **UIT-VSFC**, the citation is:

- For **UIT-ViCTSD**, the citation is:

Ali (Eds.), *Advances and Trends in Artificial Intelligence* (pp. 572–583). Springer International Publishing. doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79457-6_49.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
