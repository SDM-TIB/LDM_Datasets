To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of Uncertainty for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Owen Lockwood and Mei Si, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the studies discussed. However, in this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or specific studies. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets or their characteristics. 

In the **Discussion** and **Conclusion** sections, the authors might reference datasets indirectly by discussing the results of various studies. However, I need to ensure that I find explicit mentions of datasets used in the referenced works.

I will also check the **References section** to identify any datasets that are cited in the context of the studies discussed. This is crucial because the datasets may not be named directly in the text but could be referenced through the works of other authors.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that it references several works that utilize datasets in the context of uncertainty-aware deep reinforcement learning. I will compile a list of these datasets, ensuring to include the full citations for each one.

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark is mentioned as a common dataset for evaluating offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the D4RL benchmark is:
   > Fu, J.; Kumar, A.; Levine, S.; and Finn, C. 2020. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

2. **Atari Games**: The paper discusses the use of Atari games as benchmarks for reinforcement learning. The citation for the foundational work on Atari is:
   > Mnih, V.; Kavukcuoglu, K.; Silver, D.; Graves, A.; Antonoglou, I.; Wierstra, D.; and Riedmiller, M. 2013. *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.

3. **MuJoCo Environments**: The paper references the use of MuJoCo for continuous control tasks. The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
   > Todorov, E.; Erez, T.; and Tassa, Y. 2012. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or application of the research findings.
