To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised learning of features and object boundaries from local prediction" by Heiko H. Schütt and Wei Ji Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Berkeley segmentation database (BSDS500)**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest. I will note this down for further details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. In this section, the authors evaluate their model's performance on the **Berkeley segmentation database (BSDS500)**. They mention that contours inferred from their model perform well on this dataset, confirming its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **model instances** section, where the authors describe the training set used for their models. They state that they used the **MS COCO** dataset, which contains 123,404 color images. This dataset is also crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Berkeley Segmentation Database (BSDS500)**:
   - Citation:
     > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proc. 8th Int’l Conf. Computer Vision, volume 2, pages 416–423, July 2001.

2. **MS COCO**:
   - Citation:
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. arXiv:1405.0312 [cs], 2015.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
