To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArtFlow: Unbiased Image Style Transfer via Reversible Neural Flows" by Jie An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they use the **MS-COCO dataset** for content images and the **WikiArt dataset** for style images. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to confirm the usage of these datasets. The authors explicitly state that they use the **MS-COCO dataset** for content images and the **WikiArt dataset** for style images. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MS-COCO dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

2. **WikiArt dataset**:
   > K Nichol. *Painter by numbers, wikiart*. https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers, 2016.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **MS-COCO dataset** with the citation provided.
- **WikiArt dataset** with the citation provided.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
