To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discretize Relaxed Solution of Spectral Clustering via A Non-Heuristic Algorithm" by Hongyuan Zhang and Xuelong Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are often discussed in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on various datasets. However, they do not specify the names of the datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using **11 real datasets** to verify the effectiveness of their proposed methods. The datasets listed include:

1. **JAFFE**: A dataset containing facial images for emotion recognition.
2. **UMIST**: A dataset for face recognition.
3. **ORL**: A dataset of face images.
4. **YALE**: Another face dataset with variations in lighting and pose.
5. **COIL20**: A dataset containing images of 20 different objects.
6. **MSRA**: A dataset for face recognition.
7. **WINE**: A dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
8. **GLASS**: Another dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
9. **SEGMENT**: A dataset for image segmentation tasks.
10. **USPS**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
11. **Fashion**: A dataset for fashion item classification (Fashion MNIST).

The authors provide a summary table (Table III) that includes details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, features, and classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
