To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepGCNs: Can GCNs Go as Deep as CNNs?" by Guohao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on point cloud semantic segmentation, which suggests that a specific dataset or datasets were used for these experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4). This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets or experimental setups. In this case, the authors mention the **S3DIS dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the S3DIS dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will provide additional context about the dataset's origin and usage.

The citation for the S3DIS dataset is:
> I. Armeni, S. Sax, A. R. Zamir, and S. Savarese. *Joint 2D-3D-Semantic Data for Indoor Scene Understanding*. ArXiv e-prints, Feb. 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise entry for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper acknowledgment.
