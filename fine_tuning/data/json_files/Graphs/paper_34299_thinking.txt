To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CatLIP: CLIP-level Visual Recognition Accuracy with 2.7× Faster Pre-training on Web-scale Image-Text Data" by Sachin Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a novel weakly supervised pre-training method on web-scale image-text data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the use of large-scale datasets for pre-training vision models. They specifically refer to **CC3M** and **DataComp-1.3B** as datasets used in their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are significant for the research.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Data scaling)**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for pre-training. They mention:

1. **CC3M**: A dataset with 2.9 million samples used for pre-training. It is referenced in the context of its effectiveness in improving transfer learning accuracy.

2. **DataComp-1.3B**: A larger dataset with 1.3 billion samples, which also contributes to improved transfer learning accuracy. This dataset is highlighted as a key component of their proposed method.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CC3M**, the citation is:
  > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 2556–2565.

- For **DataComp-1.3B**, the citation is:
  > Gadre, S. Y., Ilharco, G., Fang, A., Hayase, J., Smyrnis, G., Nguyen, T., Marten, R., Wortsman, M., Ghosh, D., Zhang, J., et al. (2023). Datacomp: In search of the next generation of multimodal datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.14108.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
