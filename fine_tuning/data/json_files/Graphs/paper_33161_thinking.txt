To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hedging carbon risk with a network approach" by Michele Azzone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and results, which may include references to specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, particularly the **subsection 2.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their research. This section typically contains detailed information about the data sources, the time period covered, and the specific stocks or indices included in the analysis.

In this paper, the authors mention that their dataset spans from **January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020**, and is sourced from **Refinitiv Eikon Reuters**. They specifically analyze stocks from the **Russell 3000** and the **S&P 500 Index**. The dataset consists of **470 stocks**, categorized into **11 sectors** according to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets or specific subsets of data mentioned that may not have been detailed in the methodology section.

After gathering the necessary information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper primarily uses data from Refinitiv Eikon Reuters, I will ensure to cite this source appropriately.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Refinitiv Eikon Reuters. *Refinitiv Eikon*. [Online]. Available: https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/eikon-trading-software

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness.
