To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds using mixture model CNNs" by Federico Monti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of geometric deep learning, which may hint at the datasets used. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results section** and any dedicated **datasets section** (if present) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit classification, the **Cora dataset** for vertex classification in citation networks, and the **PubMed dataset** for similar tasks. 

I will also check the **experiments section** where they describe the methodologies and datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they provide specific details about the datasets, including the number of samples and the nature of the data.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Cora Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G. M., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

3. **PubMed Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G. M., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is accurately captured and ready for further processing or review.
