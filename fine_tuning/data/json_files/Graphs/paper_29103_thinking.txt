To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch Similarity Aware Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers" by Zhikai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss conducting extensive experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **ImageNet (ILSVRC-2012)** dataset for large-scale image classification tasks. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision, and I need to gather its details.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G.E. (2012). *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 25, 1097-1105.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ImageNet dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
