To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Injecting Text in Self-Supervised Speech Pretraining" by Zhehuai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Librispeech** and **AMI meeting transcription tasks**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as they often contain key information such as the dataset names, sizes, and purposes.

In the data section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This is a well-known dataset for ASR tasks, consisting of 960 hours of audio data derived from public domain audiobooks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

2. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset is used for meeting transcription tasks and is mentioned as a benchmark in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jean Carletta, Simone Ashby, Sebastien Bourban, et al. *The AMI meeting corpus: A pre-announcement*. In International Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction, pages 28–39, 2005.

3. **LibriLight**: This dataset is also referenced in the context of ASR and consists of a large amount of untranscribed speech data. The citation is:
   > Jacob Kahn, Morgane Rivière, Weiyi Zheng, et al. *LibriLight: A benchmark for ASR with limited or no supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 7669–7673, 2020.

Additionally, the paper mentions in-house datasets for Google Voice Search in two languages (U.S. English and Marathi), but specific citations for these datasets are not provided in the references section, as they are proprietary.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset clearly noted, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
