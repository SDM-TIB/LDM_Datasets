To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FALE: Fairness-Aware ALE Plots for Auditing Bias in Subgroups" by Giorgos Giannopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for auditing bias in subgroups but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of auditing fairness in AI systems and mention various statistical definitions and methods. However, they do not specify any datasets here either.

Next, I will examine the **demonstration section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Adult dataset** for their experiments. This is a key finding, as it indicates that this dataset is crucial for their method's evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Adult dataset. The reference is listed as follows:

- **Adult dataset**: 
  > Bache, K., Lichman, M. (2013). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used for the binary classification problem of predicting whether an instanceâ€™s outcome is either less than or greater than 50K. It is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for the Adult dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
