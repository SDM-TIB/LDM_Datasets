To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Hyper Label Model for Programmatic Weak Supervision" by Renzhi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the hyper label model was evaluated on **14 real-world datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments** section, the authors state that they used all 14 classification datasets from a recent weak supervision benchmark (Zhang et al., 2021). This is a crucial detail as it confirms the existence of a specific benchmark that contains the datasets.

I will then refer to **Table 1** in the paper, which lists the datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Census**
2. **IMDB**
3. **Yelp**
4. **Youtube**
5. **SMS**
6. **Spouse**
7. **CDR**
8. **Commercial**
9. **Tennis**
10. **Basketball**
11. **AGNews**
12. **TREC**
13. **SemEval**
14. **ChemProt**

Each dataset has associated metrics and characteristics, such as the number of classes, the number of labeling functions (LFs), and the number of data points.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the benchmark that includes these datasets. The relevant citation for the benchmark is:

- Zhang, Jieyu, et al. "Wrench: A comprehensive benchmark for weak supervision." In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, volume 1, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
