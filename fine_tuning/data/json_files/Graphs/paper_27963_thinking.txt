To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Positional Information for Session-based Recommendation" by Ruihong Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and Diginetica**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1.1, the authors provide a description of the datasets used:

1. **Yoochoose**: This dataset is derived from click-stream data collected from an e-commerce website over six months. The authors mention that it has been divided into two subsets based on timestamps: Yoo. 1/64 and Yoo. 1/4.

2. **Diginetica**: This dataset is used for the CIKM cup 2016 challenge and contains transaction data suitable for session-based recommendation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, I will reference the original sources where these datasets are commonly cited:

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > "Yoochoose dataset." RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: https://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html.

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > "Diginetica dataset." CIKM Cup 2016. Available at: http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup/.

Having identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Yoochoose** - A dataset from click-stream data for e-commerce recommendation.
2. **Diginetica** - A dataset used for session-based recommendation challenges.

I will ensure that the citations are accurately represented for each dataset to maintain proper attribution.
