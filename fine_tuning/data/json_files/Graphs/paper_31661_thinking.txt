To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Features-over-the-Air: Contrastive Learning Enabled Cooperative Edge Inference" by Haotian Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments. For instance, the authors might refer to datasets like "Market-1501" in their evaluations. I will note down any datasets mentioned along with their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Market-1501" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Note down the names and characteristics of the datasets.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
