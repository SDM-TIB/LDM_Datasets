To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Data2Vec: Noise-Robust Speech Representation Learning for ASR by Combining Regression and Improved Contrastive Learning" by Qiu-Shi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **CHiME-4 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **CHiME-4 dataset** and provide context about its collection and characteristics. They describe it as containing real and artificially simulated noisy speech data collected using a six-channel distant microphone array and a close-by microphone. This section confirms that the CHiME-4 dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention the **MUSAN dataset** as a source of noise data used during the pre-training stage. They describe it as containing 109 hours of data, including English speech, music, and noise data. This dataset is also relevant to their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CHiME-4 dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Menne, J. Heymann, A. Alexandridis, K. Irie, A. Zeyer, M. Kitza, P. Golik, I. Kulikov, L. Drude, R. Schlüter, et al. "The rwth/upb/forth system combination for the 4th chime challenge evaluation." In Proc. of CHiME-4 Workshop, 2016, pp. 49–51.

- For the **MUSAN dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Snyder, G. Chen, and D. Povey. "Musan: A music, speech, and noise corpus." arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.08484, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CHiME-4 Dataset**: A dataset containing real and artificially simulated noisy speech data collected using a six-channel distant microphone array and a close-by microphone.

2. **MUSAN Dataset**: A dataset that includes 109 hours of data, comprising English speech, music, and noise data, used for synthesizing noisy speech.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
