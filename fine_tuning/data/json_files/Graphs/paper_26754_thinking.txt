To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Should Not Be Contrastive in Contrastive Learning" by Tete Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluate on" or "we use the following datasets."

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsection that discusses datasets. The authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant splits (e.g., training/test splits).

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **ImageNet (IN-100)**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset containing 100 categories, used for fast ablation studies. It consists of approximately 125,000 images.
   
2. **iNaturalist 2019 (iNat-1k)**: A large-scale classification dataset containing 1,010 species with a combined training and validation set of 268,243 images.

3. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds 2011 dataset, which contains 5,994 training and 5,794 testing images of 200 bird species.

4. **Flowers-102**: A dataset consisting of 102 flower categories, with between 40 and 258 images per category.

5. **ObjectNet**: A test set collected to show objects from new viewpoints on new backgrounds, originally containing 313 categories, but only 13 categories overlapping with IN-100 are used.

6. **ImageNet-C**: A dataset that consists of 15 diverse corruption types applied to validation images of ImageNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
