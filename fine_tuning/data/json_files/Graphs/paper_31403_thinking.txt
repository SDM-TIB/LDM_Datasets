To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reliable Beamforming at Terahertz Bands: Are Causal Representations the Way Forward?" by Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas and Walid Saad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of simulations to evaluate the proposed beamforming solution, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in these simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation results and mention that they consider three benchmarks for comparison: perfect channel estimates, beam tracking using a DFT codebook, and naive beamforming using least squares estimated channels. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets used for these simulations.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The authors reference various works that may have datasets related to terahertz communications or beamforming techniques, but I need to ensure that these references actually correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works, but none of them explicitly mention datasets that are used in the experiments. The references primarily discuss theoretical frameworks, algorithms, and previous research findings rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper**. The authors focused on simulation results based on theoretical models rather than empirical datasets.
2. **References to other works** do not provide direct citations for datasets used in the experiments.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses simulation results and benchmarks, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will note that no dataset entries can be created for this paper based on the information provided.
