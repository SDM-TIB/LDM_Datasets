To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Level Sequence Denoising with Cross-Signal Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation" by Xiaofei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experimental studies on **five public datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **ML-100k**: This dataset is a widely used benchmark in sequential recommendation tasks, containing 99,287 sequences, 944 users, and 1,350 items, with an average sequence length of 105.29 and a sparsity of 92.21%.

2. **Beauty**: This dataset consists of user historical purchases in the beauty category, with 198,502 sequences, 22,364 users, and 12,102 items, having an average sequence length of 8.88 and a sparsity of 99.93%.

3. **Sports**: Similar to the Beauty dataset, this dataset contains user purchases in the sports category, comprising 296,337 sequences, 35,599 users, and 18,358 items, with an average sequence length of 8.32 and a sparsity of 99.95%.

4. **Yelp**: This dataset records user reviews for various restaurants and bars, containing 316,354 sequences, 30,432 users, and 20,034 items, with an average sequence length of 10.40 and a sparsity of 99.95%.

5. **ML-1M**: This is another version of the MovieLens dataset, containing 999,611 sequences, 6,041 users, and 3,417 items, with an average sequence length of 165.50 and a sparsity of 95.16%.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
