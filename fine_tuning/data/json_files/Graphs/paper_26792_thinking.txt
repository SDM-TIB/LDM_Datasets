To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Disease Diagnosis with Inductive Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks" by Zifeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on a "large-scale EHR dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their research. The introduction further elaborates on the use of publicly available EHR datasets, specifically mentioning **MIMIC-III** and **CPRD**. This suggests that these datasets are integral to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the EHR data collected from hospitals and mention that they extracted entities from clinical notes using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. They also provide statistics about the EHR graph, which indicates the datasets' structure and content.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the datasets used for validation and testing. They specifically mention that they collected electronic clinical notes from several hospitals, which form the basis of their EHR dataset. 

Now, I will compile the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations from the references section:

1. **MIMIC-III**: This dataset is a freely accessible critical care database that contains de-identified health data associated with over forty thousand patients. The citation for MIMIC-III is:
   > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data 3 (2016).

2. **CPRD**: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink is a large database of anonymized primary care records. The citation for CPRD is:
   > Emily Herrett, Arlene M. Gallagher, Krishnan Bhaskaran, Harriet Forbes, Rohini Mathur, Tjeerd van Staa, and Liam Smeeth. *Data resource profile: Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)*. International Journal of Epidemiology 44 (2015).

3. **Custom EHR Dataset**: The authors also mention that they collected and labeled more than 50,000 medical corpus via crowdsourcing for their specific study. However, this dataset does not have a formal citation as it is likely proprietary to their research.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details and citations in the required format for further processing or review.
