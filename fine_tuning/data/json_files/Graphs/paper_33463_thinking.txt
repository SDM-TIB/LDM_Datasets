To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIM4DD: Mutual Information Maximization for Dataset Distillation" by Yuzhang Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28 × 28 pixels.

2. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is another popular dataset for digit recognition, which consists of real-world images of house numbers.

3. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

4. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

- **SVHN**:
  > Pierre Sermanet, Soumith Chintala, and Yann LeCun. *Convolutional neural networks applied to house numbers digit classification*. In ICPR, 2012.

- **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their respective citations for proper referencing.
