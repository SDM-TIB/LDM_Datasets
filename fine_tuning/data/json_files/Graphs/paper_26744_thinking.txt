To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Sample Efficient Agents through Algorithmic Alignment" by Mingxuan Li and Michael L. Littman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the Deep Graph Value Network (DeepGV) and its application in reinforcement learning, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction focuses on the theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning and algorithmic alignment but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any details regarding the datasets used to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments mention evaluating the framework on two types of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), specifically a slippery N Ã— N grid world and another grid world with obstacles and fire states. However, these are not traditional datasets but rather generated environments for testing the algorithm.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or specific datasets used in the experiments, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works provide datasets relevant to the experiments. The references include works by Battaglia et al. (2018), Sutton and Barto (2018), and Xu et al. (2020), but they do not specify datasets either.

Given that the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper and provide the relevant citations for the references mentioned, even though they do not pertain to specific datasets.

The citations from the references section are as follows:

1. Battaglia, P. W.; Hamrick, J. B.; et al. 2018. *Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks*. CoRR abs/1806.01261.
2. Sutton, R. S.; and Barto, A. G. 2018. *Reinforcement learning: An introduction*. MIT Press.
3. Xu, K.; Li, J.; et al. 2020. *What Can Neural Networks Reason About?* In ICLR.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
