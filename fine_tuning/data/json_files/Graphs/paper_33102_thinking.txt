To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaCCD: Adaptive Semantic Contrasts Discovery Based Cross Lingual Adaptation for Code Clone Detection" by Yangkai Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a **multilingual code clone detection benchmark consisting of 5 programming languages**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1 (Evaluation Benchmark & Setting)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they collected datasets in **Rust, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, and C#** from **CodeNet**. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the specific programming languages for which datasets were created.

In this section, the authors also mention that they randomly split each dataset into train/validation/test splits, which is important for understanding how the datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **CodeNet dataset** in the **References section**. The citation provided is:
> Puri, R.; Kung, D.; Janssen, G.; Zhang, W.; Domeniconi, G.; Zolotov, V.; Dolby, J. T.; Chen, J.; Choudhury, M.; Decker, L.; Thost, V.; Buratti, L.; Pujar, S.; Ramji, S.; Finkler, U.; Malaika, S.; and Reiss, F. (2021). *CodeNet: A Large-Scale AI for Code Dataset for Learning a Diversity of Coding Tasks*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, volume 1, pages 12310â€“12320.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CodeNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for code-related tasks, which includes multiple programming languages such as Rust, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, and C#.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details, including the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
