To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLMSM: A Multi-Task Learning Framework for Pre-training on Procedural Text" by Abhilash Nandy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on three datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NPN-Cooking Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing 65,816 training, 175 development, and 700 evaluation recipes, with human annotations regarding changes in the status and location of entities throughout the procedure. 

2. **ProPara Dataset**: This dataset consists of 488 human-authored procedures with 81,000 annotations regarding the changing states of entities. It is split into training, development, and test sets.

3. **ARA Dataset**: The ARA dataset includes 110 recipes for 10 different dishes, annotated with 1592 action pairs through crowdsourcing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NPN-Cooking Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bosselut, Omer Levy, Ari Holtzman, Corin Ennis, Dieter Fox, and Yejin Choi. *Simulating action dynamics with neural process networks*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1-10, 2017.

- For the **ProPara Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Lifu Huang, Niket Tandon, Wen-tau Yih, and Peter Clark. *Tracking state changes in procedural text: A challenge dataset and models for process paragraph comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1-10, 2018.

- For the **ARA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lucia Donatelli, Theresa Schmidt, Debanjali Biswas, Arne KÃ¶hn, Fangzhou Zhai, and Alexander Koller. *Aligning actions across recipe graphs*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 6930-6942, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
