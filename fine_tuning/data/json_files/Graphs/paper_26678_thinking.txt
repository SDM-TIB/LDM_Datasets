To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AM-GCN: Adaptive Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Networks" by Xiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

In the identified section, I will extract the names of the datasets along with their descriptions. The paper mentions six datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Citeseer**: A research paper citation network with 3327 nodes and 4732 edges, divided into 6 classes.
2. **UAI2010**: A dataset with 3067 nodes and 28311 edges, used for community detection.
3. **ACM**: A network extracted from the ACM dataset with 3025 nodes and 13128 edges, divided into 3 classes.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network with 5196 nodes and 171743 edges, divided into 6 classes.
5. **Flickr**: A social network with 7575 nodes and 239738 edges, divided into 9 classes.
6. **CoraFull**: A larger version of the Cora dataset with 19793 nodes and 65311 edges, labeled based on paper topics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Citeseer**:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
