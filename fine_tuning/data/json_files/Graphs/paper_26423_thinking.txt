To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GLSearch: Maximum Common Subgraph Detection via Learning to Search" by Yunsheng Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on "synthetic and real-world graph datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1**, the authors provide a list of datasets used for their experiments, which includes:

1. **NCI109**: A collection of small-sized chemical compounds, with 100 graph pairs formed from the dataset. The average graph size is noted as 28.73 nodes.

2. **ROAD**: A road network of California, containing 1,965,206 nodes. The authors mention that they randomly sample a connected subgraph for their experiments.

3. **DBEN, DBZH, DBPD**: These are pairs of DBpedia knowledge graphs in different languages, with specific sampling methods described.

4. **ENRO**: An email communication network with 36,692 nodes, from which around 10% are sampled.

5. **COPR**: An Amazon computer product network with 703,655 nodes, sampled to create the graph pair.

6. **CIRC**: A bipartite graph representing circuit diagrams, where the two graphs are known to be isomorphic.

7. **HPPI**: A human protein-protein interaction network with 21,557 nodes, from which around 10% are sampled.

8. **ROAD-CA and ROAD-TX**: Variants of the ROAD dataset, with different sampling percentages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
