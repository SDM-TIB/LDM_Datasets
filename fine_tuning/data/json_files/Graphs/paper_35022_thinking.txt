To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Confidence Degree Based Graph Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection" by Jiaxun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **T-Finance Dataset**: This dataset is aimed at identifying anomalous accounts in transaction networks. It consists of unique anonymized accounts characterized by 10-dimensional features related to registration days, logging activities, and interaction frequency. The edges represent transaction records between accounts, and human experts annotate nodes as anomalies if they fall into categories such as fraud, money laundering, or online gambling.

2. **FDCompCN Dataset**: This dataset is used to detect financial statement fraud in Chinese companies. It constructs a multi-relation graph based on supplier, customer, shareholder, and financial information from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. It includes data from 5,317 publicly listed companies on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges between 2020 and 2023. The dataset features three relations: C-I-C (investment relationships), C-P-C (companies and their disclosed customers), and C-S-C (companies and their disclosed suppliers).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **T-Finance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Li, J., Gao, Z., & Li, J. (2022). Rethinking graph neural networks for anomaly detection. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 21076–21089). PMLR.

- For the **FDCompCN Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
