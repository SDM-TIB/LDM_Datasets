To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks" by Kamesh Korangi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study utilizes "30 years of data on mid-cap firms," which indicates that there is a dataset related to mid-cap firms' historical data. This is a good starting point for identifying the dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They state that they collected "the daily closing prices of all mid-cap companies listed in the US over 30 years, from 1990 to 2021." This provides a clear indication of the dataset's scope and timeframe.

In the same section, the authors mention that they have approximately "20,000 firms active for at least part of this period," which further clarifies the dataset's size and relevance. They also describe how they processed this data into daily returns and volatility series, which are essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is based on historical stock prices, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset would. However, the authors do reference their methodology and the sources of their data collection, which can be useful for citation purposes.

The relevant citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset**: Daily closing prices of mid-cap companies listed in the US from 1990 to 2021.
- **Citation**: Korangi, K., Mues, C., & Bravo, C. (2022). Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks. *Preprint*. Available under a Creative Commons BY license.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation and relevant details about the dataset's content and characteristics. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information for future reference or analysis.
