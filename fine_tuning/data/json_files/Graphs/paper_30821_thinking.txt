To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Faithful Rationale for Multi-hop Fact Verification via Salience-Aware Graph Learning" by Jiasheng Si et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "experimental results on the FEVEROUS benchmark," indicating that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of fact verification and refer to the FEVER dataset, which is a well-known dataset in this domain. However, they specifically mention using the **FEVEROUS dataset** for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about the FEVEROUS dataset, including its structure and the number of claims and evidence pieces. They mention that the dataset is constructed to include claims with associated evidence, and they provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of claims with SUPPORT and REFUTE labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FEVEROUS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- Aly, R.; Guo, Z.; Schlichtkrull, M. S.; Thorne, J.; Vlachos, A.; Christodoulopoulos, C.; Cocarascu, O.; and Mittal, A. (2021). *FEVEROUS: Fact Extraction and VERiÔ¨Åcation Over Unstructured and Structured information*. In proceedings of NeurIPS.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **FEVEROUS Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-hop fact verification and includes claims with associated evidence. It is designed to facilitate the evaluation of models in the context of fact verification.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
