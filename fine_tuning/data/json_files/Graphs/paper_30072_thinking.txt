To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Joint Normal Estimation and Point Cloud Filtering" by Dasith de Silva Edirimuni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on point cloud filtering and normal estimation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their training, validation, and testing datasets. They mention using **22 synthetic point clouds** for training, which consist of **11 CAD shapes and 11 non-CAD shapes**. This indicates that there is a dataset specifically created for their experiments.

In the same section, the authors detail the **validation set**, which consists of **3 shapes** (1 CAD and 2 non-CAD shapes), and the **test set**, which includes **23 shapes** (14 CAD and 9 non-CAD shapes). Each shape is a point cloud of **100K points**, randomly sampled from their original surfaces. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

The authors also describe how they created additional noisy variants of each training shape by adding Gaussian noise, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the datasets are synthetic and created by the authors, there may not be external citations for them. Instead, I will document the dataset details as described in the paper.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Synthetic Point Cloud Dataset**: Comprising 22 synthetic point clouds (11 CAD shapes and 11 non-CAD shapes) used for training.
2. **Validation Dataset**: Consisting of 3 shapes (1 CAD and 2 non-CAD shapes).
3. **Test Dataset**: Comprising 23 shapes (14 CAD and 9 non-CAD shapes).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the datasets as described in the paper, along with any relevant citations if applicable.

Since the datasets are synthetic and created by the authors, I will note that in the dataset descriptions. The full citation for the paper will also be included to provide context for the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
