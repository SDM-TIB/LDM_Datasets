To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Seeking Patterns, Not just Memorizing Procedures: Contrastive Learning for Solving Math Word Problems" by Zhongli Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Chinese dataset Math23k** and the **English dataset MathQA**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for better understanding of Math Word Problems (MWPs) and mention the datasets again, confirming their relevance to the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They specify that:

1. **Math23k**: This dataset consists of 23,000 Math Word Problems (MWPs) focused on elementary education.
2. **MathQA**: This dataset contains 37,000 MWPs that include multiple-choice questions and equations.

The authors also mention that they adapted MathQA to align with Math23k, which is important for understanding the datasets' context.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Math23k**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Liu, X., & Shi, S. (2017). Deep neural solver for math word problems. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 845-854). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MathQA**, the citation is:
  > Amini, A., Gabriel, S., Lin, S., Koncel-Kedziorski, R., Choi, Y., & Hajishirzi, H. (2019). MathQA: Towards interpretable math word problem solving with operation-based formalisms. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 2357-2367). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
