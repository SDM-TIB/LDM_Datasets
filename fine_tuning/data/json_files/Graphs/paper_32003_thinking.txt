To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-shot Visual Question Answering with Language Model Feedback" by Yifan Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two knowledge-based VQA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **OK-VQA**: This dataset is described as containing 5,046 questions in the test set that require external knowledge resources to answer. It is crucial to note that this dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed method.

2. **A-OKVQA**: This is an augmented dataset based on OK-VQA, which requires additional types of world knowledge compared to OK-VQA. The authors mention that the test set of A-OKVQA is not public, but they evaluate their method on the validation set.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **OK-VQA**, the citation is:
  > Kenneth Marino, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, and Roozbeh Mottaghi. *OK-VQA: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3195–3204, 2019.

- For **A-OKVQA**, the citation is:
  > Dustin Schwenk, Apoorv Khandelwal, Christopher Clark, Kenneth Marino, and Roozbeh Mottaghi. *A-OKVQA: A benchmark for visual question answering using world knowledge*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2022 - 17th European Conference, Tel Aviv, Israel, October 23-27, 2022, Proceedings, Part VIII, volume 13668 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 146–162, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
