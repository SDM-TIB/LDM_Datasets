To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Sequential Recommendation with Attribute-augmented Graph Neural Networks" by Xinzhou Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further elaborates on the sequential recommendation task and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention three datasets: 

1. **Yoochoose Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains user click sequence data from an e-commerce website. The authors mention that they used two subsets of this dataset (1/64 and 1/4) for their experiments.

2. **Diginetica Dataset**: This dataset is from the CIKM Cup 2016 and provides item attribute information, including category, priceLog2, and item name tokens. The authors specify that they only used the transactional data from this dataset.

3. **MX Player Dataset**: This is a custom dataset created from the MX Player logs, focusing on movie interactions over a specific period. The authors describe the filtering process and the attributes included in this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Yoochoose Dataset**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2015. *http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html*.

- For the **Diginetica Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CIKM Cup 2016. *http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup*.

- For the **MX Player Dataset**, since it is a custom dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is derived from the MX Player logs.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
