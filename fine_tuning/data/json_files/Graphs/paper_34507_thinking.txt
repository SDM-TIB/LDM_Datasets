To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality-guided Contrastive Rationale Distillation for Large Language Models" by Wei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "multiple reasoning tasks" and refers to "four popular datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **SVAMP**: This dataset is used for arithmetic word problem solving and is referenced as having a training set of 720 examples and a validation set of 80 examples.

2. **CQA**: This dataset is for commonsense question answering, with a training set of 16,946 examples and a validation set of 975 examples.

3. **e-SNLI**: This dataset is used for natural language inference, with a training set of 549,367 examples and a validation set of 9,842 examples.

4. **ANLI**: This dataset is also for natural language inference, with a training set of 1,000 examples and a validation set of 1,000 examples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **SVAMP**, the citation is:
  > Aakanksha Patel, Satwik Bhattamishra, and Navin Goyal. *Are NLP models really able to solve simple math word problems?* arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.07191, 2021.

- For **CQA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00937, 2018.

- For **e-SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Oana-Maria Camburu, Tim RocktÃ¤schel, Thomas Lukasiewicz, and Phil Blunsom. *e-SNLI: Natural language inference with natural language explanations*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 31, 2018.

- For **ANLI**, the citation is:
  > Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Boyuan Pan, Bin Sun, Xinglin Wang, Heda Wang, and Kan Li. *Adversarial NLI: A new benchmark for natural language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.14599, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
