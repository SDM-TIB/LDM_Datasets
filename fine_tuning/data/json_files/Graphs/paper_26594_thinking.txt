To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MVIN: Learning Multiview Items for Recommendation" by Chang-You Tai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on three real-world datasets: **MovieLens-1M (ML-1M)**, **LFM-1b 2015 (LFM-1b)**, and **Amazon-Book (AZ-book)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MovieLens-1M (ML-1M)**: A benchmark dataset for movie recommendations with approximately 1 million explicit ratings on a total of 2,445 items from 6,036 users.

2. **LFM-1b 2015 (LFM-1b)**: A music dataset that records artists, albums, tracks, and users, containing about 3 million explicit rating records on 15,471 items from 12,134 users.

3. **Amazon-Book (AZ-book)**: This dataset records user preferences on book products, containing about half a million explicit rating records on a total of 9,854 items from 7,000 users.

I will also check the **dataset statistics table** (Table 1) for additional details, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and the source of the knowledge graph (KG) used for each dataset.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically included in the references or may be attributed to specific papers or sources. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015. 

- For **LFM-1b**, the citation is:
  > Fuzheng Zhang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Defu Lian, Xing Xie, and Wei-Ying Ma. *Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding for Recommender Systems*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’16), pages 353–362, 2016. 

- For **Amazon-Book**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’16), pages 897–906, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
