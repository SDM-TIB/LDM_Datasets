To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Train for Two Tasks: An Encrypted Traffic Classification Framework Using Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Haozhen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **ISCX VPN-nonVPN** and **ISCX Tor-nonTor** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **ISCX VPN-nonVPN Dataset**: This dataset is a collection of two datasets: the ISCX-VPN and ISCX-nonVPN. The ISCX-VPN dataset contains traffic collected over virtual private networks (VPNs), while the ISCX-nonVPN dataset contains regular traffic not collected over VPNs.

2. **ISCX Tor-nonTor Dataset**: This dataset consists of the ISCX-Tor and ISCX-nonTor datasets. The ISCX-Tor dataset involves traffic collected over the Tor network, while the ISCX-nonTor dataset contains regular traffic not collected over Tor.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of flows, packets, and categories, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gerard Drapper Gil, Arash Habibi Lashkari, Mohammad Mamun, and Ali A. Ghorbani. *Characterization of Encrypted and VPN Traffic Using Time-Related Features*. In International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy, pages 407–414, 2016.

- For the **ISCX Tor-nonTor dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arash Habibi Lashkari, Gerard Draper-Gil, Mohammad Saiful Islam Mamun, and Ali A. Ghorbani. *Characterization of Tor Traffic Using Time Based Features*. In International Conference on Information System Security and Privacy, pages 253–262, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
