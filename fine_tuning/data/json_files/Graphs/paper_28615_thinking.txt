To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIO: Mutual Information Optimization using Self-Supervised Binary Contrastive Learning" by Siladittya Manna et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive self-supervised frameworks on benchmark datasets like **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset is designed for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 5,000 labeled training images and 100,000 unlabeled images.

4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng. *The Importance of Encoding Versus Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Tiny ImageNet. *https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
