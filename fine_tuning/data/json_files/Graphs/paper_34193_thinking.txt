To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-enhanced Retrieval in Real-time Search" by Yanan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have produced a dataset themselves, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created. They mention that the dataset is gathered from user logs of Tencent QQ Browser Search, which is significant as it indicates the dataset's source and context.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset includes **2,964,077 training queries** and **1,096 testing queries**.
- It contains **5,323,681 training titles** and **4,733 testing titles**.
- There are **10,319,501 training query-title pairs** and **10,2279 testing query-title pairs**.

This detailed breakdown is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- **Event-enhanced Retrieval Dataset**: 
  > Yanan Zhang, Xiaoling Bai, Tianhua Zhou. *Event-enhanced Retrieval in Real-time Search*. Available at: https://github.com/open-event-hub/Event-enhanced_Retrieval.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
