To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Deep Video Deinterlacing" by Haichao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (DCNN-based Video Deinterlacing)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Training Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe how they prepared their training dataset. Here, they mention collecting 33 videos from the Internet and capturing 18 videos using progressive scan devices. They synthesized interlaced videos from these progressive videos, which indicates that the dataset is derived from existing video content rather than a pre-existing dataset.

The authors specify that they obtained a total of 153 frame pairs from these videos, which they used to create their training dataset. They also mention that they collected 9,792 patch triplets for training, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or any related works that describe the original videos used. However, since the authors synthesized their dataset from various sources, I will note that the dataset does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.

The references to the original videos or methods used to create the dataset may not be explicitly listed as a dataset citation, but I will include the relevant papers that describe the methods or datasets they synthesized from.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **Synthesis of Interlaced Videos**: This dataset consists of synthesized interlaced videos created from 33 videos collected from the Internet and 18 videos captured by the authors. The dataset includes 153 frame pairs and 9,792 patch triplets used for training.

Since there are no formal citations for this synthesized dataset, I will note that it is derived from various sources and does not have a specific reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
