To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graph-Augmented Language Models for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation" by Minki Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their framework on **OpendialKG** and **KOMODIS** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they confirm that they validate their SURGE framework on the **OpendialKG** and **KOMODIS** datasets, providing additional context about each dataset's characteristics and relevance to their research.

In the **OpendialKG** section, the authors describe it as a dialogue dataset associated with a large-scale knowledge graph (Freebase), consisting of 15K dialogues with 91K utterances. They also mention that 49% of the utterances come with gold knowledge, which is crucial for their experiments.

For the **KOMODIS** dataset, the authors state that it contains 7.5K dialogues associated with a knowledge graph having 88K facts. This dataset is used to further validate the effectiveness of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **OpendialKG**, the citation is:
  > Seungwhan Moon, Pararth Shah, Anuj Kumar, and Rajen Subba. *Opendialkg: Explainable conversational reasoning with attention-based walks over knowledge graphs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019, pages 845–854.

- For **KOMODIS**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Galetzka, Chukwuemeka Uchenna Eneh, and David Schlangen. *A corpus of controlled opinionated and knowledgeable movie discussions for training neural conversation models*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, LREC 2020, Marseille, France, May 11-16, 2020, pages 565–573.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for reference. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
