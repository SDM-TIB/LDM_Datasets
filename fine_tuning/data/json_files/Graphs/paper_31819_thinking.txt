To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIORE: Leveraging High-order Interactions for Unified Entity Relation Extraction" by Yijun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmarks: **ACE04, ACE05, and SciERC**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the three datasets:

1. **ACE04**: This dataset is referenced as part of the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program, which includes tasks related to entity and relation extraction.

2. **ACE05**: Similar to ACE04, this dataset is also part of the ACE program and is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed model.

3. **SciERC**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for scientific entity relation classification, which is relevant to the tasks addressed in the paper.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **ACE04**, the citation is:
  > George Doddington, Alexis Mitchell, Mark Przybocki, Lance Ramshaw, Stephanie Strassel, and Ralph Weischedel. *The automatic content extraction (ACE) program â€“ tasks, data, and evaluation*. In LREC, 2004.

- For **ACE05**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Walker, Stephanie Strassel, Julie Medero, and Kazuaki Maeda. *ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus*. LDC, 2006.

- For **SciERC**, the citation is:
  > Yi Luan, Luheng He, Mari Ostendorf, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction*. In EMNLP, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily referenced in future work.
