To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Novel Class Discovery via Feature Enhancement and Adaptation" by Yifan Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for. I will note down any dataset names mentioned here.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, number of classes, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:
1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, with 5,000 training samples and 1,000 testing samples per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 500 training samples and 100 testing samples per class.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset includes around 120,000 images across 200 classes, with 500 training samples, 50 validation samples, and 50 testing samples per class.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
