To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Electronic Health Record Coding through Graph Contrastive Learning" by Shanshan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **MIMIC-III benchmark dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction mentions the challenges of EHR coding and references the MIMIC-III dataset, confirming its importance in the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is described as a large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the MIMIC-III dataset is discussed in more detail. However, it appears that the MIMIC-III dataset is the primary dataset used throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1–9, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients between 2001 and 2012.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1–9, 2016.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset details as required.
