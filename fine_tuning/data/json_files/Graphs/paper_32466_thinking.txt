To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Temporal Edge Regression: A Case Study on Agriculture Trade Between Nations" by Lekang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **UN Trade dataset** for evaluating the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in predicting food and agriculture trade values between nations. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 4.1 (Dataset)**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **UN Trade dataset**. They explain that it contains trade statistics on food and agriculture products imported or exported annually by 181 nations from 1986 to 2017, with around 500,000 edges representing trade relationships. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **UN Trade dataset**. The authors reference a source that provides details about the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> Farimah Poursafaei, Shenyang Huang, Kellin Pelrine, and Reihaneh Rabbany. *Towards better evaluation for dynamic link prediction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.10128, 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **UN Trade Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate GNN models for edge regression tasks, focusing on predicting trade values between nations. It includes trade data from 1986 to 2017 for 181 countries.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
