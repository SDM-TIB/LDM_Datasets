To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAR-GNN: Spatial-Temporal Video Representation for Content-Based Retrieval" by Guoping Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the STAR-GNN framework and its application in video retrieval, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of content-based video retrieval but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they verify the effectiveness of STAR-GNN on two datasets: **VCDB** and **SVD**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experimental results.

In this section, the authors provide details about each dataset:

1. **VCDB**: This dataset contains 100,528 videos, with 528 queries and 6,139 manually annotated as positive retrieval samples. It was initially used for partial copy detection in videos and is widely used to evaluate video retrieval models.

2. **SVD**: This dataset is introduced for large-scale short video retrieval, containing 562,013 short videos from Douyin (TikTok China). It includes 1,206 queries and 34,020 labeled videos, with 10,211 positive retrieval samples and 26,927 negative samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **VCDB**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Gang Jiang, Yudong Jiang, and Jiajun Wang. *VCDB: A Large-Scale Database for Partial Copy Detection in Videos*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 357–371, 2014.

- For **SVD**, the citation is:
  > Qing-Yuan Jiang, Yi He, Gen Li, Jian Lin, Lei Li, and Wu-Jun Li. *SVD: A Large-Scale Short Video Dataset for Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5281–5289, 2019.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
