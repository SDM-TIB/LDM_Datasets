To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning on Blended Images for Long-tailed Recognition" by Minki Jeong and Changick Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their method on three long-tailed recognition benchmarks:

1. **CIFAR-100-LT**: This dataset is a long-tailed version of the CIFAR-100 dataset, which consists of 100 classes. The authors mention that it is created by artificially excluding training data to create a long-tailed distribution.

2. **ImageNet-LT**: This is a subset of the ImageNet 2012 dataset, specifically designed to create a long-tailed distribution with 1000 imbalanced classes.

3. **iNaturalist 2018**: This dataset is noted for being imbalanced from the data collection stage, containing 437,513 training images across 8,142 classes.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **iNaturalist 2018**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
