To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Triplet Edge Attention for Algorithmic Reasoning" by Yeonjoon Jung and Sungsoo Ahn, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically validate their method on the **CLRS benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments using the **CLRS benchmark**. This benchmark includes 30 classical algorithms categorized into 8 distinct groups, reformatted as graph structures for training on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This indicates that the CLRS benchmark is indeed a dataset used for their research.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citation for the CLRS benchmark to ensure proper attribution. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CLRS benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Petar Veličković, Adrià Puigdomènech Badia, David Budden, Razvan Pascanu, Andrea Banino, Misha Dashevskiy, Raia Hadsell, and Charles Blundell. *The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 22084–22102. PMLR, 2022.

Since the paper primarily discusses the CLRS benchmark and does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on this dataset for my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CLRS benchmark, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
