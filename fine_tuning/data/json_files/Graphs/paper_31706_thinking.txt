To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Tree-based Index for Efficient and Effective Dense Retrieval" by Qingyao Ai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "numerous popular retrieval benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **MS MARCO dataset**, which is a large-scale ad-hoc retrieval benchmark containing two tasks: Document Retrieval and Passage Retrieval. The details provided include the corpus sizes and the number of training and development queries, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they conducted their experiments on the MS MARCO dataset, which reinforces its significance as a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MS MARCO dataset from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@ NIPs, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MS MARCO dataset, I will document this dataset in detail, ensuring to include the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for review or further processing.
