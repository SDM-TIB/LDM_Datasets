To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Contrastive Quantization for Efficient Cross-View Video Retrieval" by Bin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **MSRVTT Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,000 YouTube videos, each annotated with 20 captions. The authors mention that they use three data splits, specifically "1k-A," "1k-B," and the official split.

2. **LSMDC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 118,081 video clips from 202 movies, with each clip annotated with a caption. The authors follow a specific split for evaluation.

3. **ActivityNet Captions Dataset**: This dataset includes 20,000 YouTube videos, each paired with several captions. The authors specify that they train the model with 10,009 videos and evaluate on a specific validation split.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MSRVTT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For the **LSMDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anna Rohrbach, Marcus Rohrbach, Niket Tandon, and Bernt Schiele. *A Dataset for Movie Description*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3202–3212, 2015.

- For the **ActivityNet Captions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-Captioning Events in Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 706–715, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
