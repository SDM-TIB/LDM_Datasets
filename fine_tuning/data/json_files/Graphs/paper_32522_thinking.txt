To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose Modulated Avatars from Video" by Chunjin Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "video sequences," which suggests that datasets related to video data may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details that describe how they were used in the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Human3.6M Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. It is a well-known dataset for human pose estimation and includes various sequences of human actions captured in a controlled environment.

2. **MonoPerfCap Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a high-resolution dataset used for evaluating the robustness of the proposed method to unseen poses in monocular videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Human3.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ionescu, C., Li, F., & Sminchisescu, C. (2011). Latent structured models for human pose estimation. In *ICCV*.

- For the **MonoPerfCap Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, W., Chatterjee, A., Zollh√∂fer, M., Rhodin, H., Mehta, D., Seidel, H.-P., & Theobalt, C. (2018). Monoperfcap: Human performance capture from monocular video. In *ACM TOG*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
