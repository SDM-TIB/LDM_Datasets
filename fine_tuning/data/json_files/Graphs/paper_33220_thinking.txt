To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIPC8: Face liveness detection algorithm based on image-text pairs and contrastive learning" by Xu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **five public datasets** and a **new dataset called CLASS-8**. This suggests that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the limitations of existing liveness detection algorithms and the datasets they used for evaluation. They specifically list **NUAA, CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU, and MSU-MFSD** as the public datasets, and they introduce the **CLASS-8 dataset** as a new dataset designed for their experiments.

In the **section dedicated to the CLASS-8 dataset**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including its purpose and the types of images it contains. They categorize the images into eight types, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

6. **CLASS-8 Dataset**:
   > Xu Liu, Shu Zhou, Yurong Song, Wenzhe Luo, Xin Zhang. *CLASS-8: A dataset for face liveness detection*. This dataset is introduced in the paper itself, and since it is newly proposed, it does not have a separate citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
