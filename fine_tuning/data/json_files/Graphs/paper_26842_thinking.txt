To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Efficient Multi-Task Segmentation using Contrastive Learning" by Junichiro Iwasawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the focus on 3D medical images and segmentation tasks, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for these experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining annotations for medical images and the importance of automated segmentation. This context indicates that they likely utilized specific datasets to evaluate their proposed methods.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly mention using the **brain tumor dataset provided by the Medical Segmentation Decathlon**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

The paper states that the brain tumor dataset includes multimodal 3D MRI scans from patients diagnosed with glioblastoma or lower-grade glioma. It specifies that the dataset consists of 484 labeled data points, which are split into training, validation, and test sets. This detailed description is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the brain tumor dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Medical Segmentation Decathlon**: 
  > Simpson, A.L., Antonelli, M., Bakas, S., Bilello, M., Farahani, K., van Ginneken, B., Kopp-Schneider, A., Landman, B.A., Litjens, G., Menze, B., Ronneberger, O., Summers, R.M., Bilic, P., Christ, P.F., Do, R.K.G., Gollub, M., Golia-Pernicka, J., Heckers, S.H., Jarnagin, W.R., McHugo, M.K., Napel, S., Vorontsov, E., Maier-Hein, L., Cardoso, M.J. "A large annotated medical image dataset for the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms." arXiv e-prints arXiv:1902.09063 (2019).

With this information, I have identified the primary dataset used in the research. I will now compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: A dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon containing multimodal 3D MRI scans for brain tumor segmentation tasks.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
