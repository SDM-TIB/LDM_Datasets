To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate and Real-time 3D Pedestrian Detection Using an Efficient Attentive Pillar Network" by Duy Tho Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework, PiFeNet, has been evaluated on three popular large-scale datasets for 3D pedestrian detection, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for 3D object detection tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The authors indicate that it contains 7,481 training samples and 7,518 testing samples, specifically for the pedestrian category.

2. **JRDB Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a novel human-centric dataset with over 1.8 million 3D cuboids surrounding pedestrians in various settings. It consists of 54 sequences, split evenly for training and testing.

3. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark for evaluating the proposed method, although specific details about its structure or size are not provided in the text.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

- For the **JRDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Martin-Martin, M. Patel, H. Rezatofigi, A. Shenoi, A. Gwak, J. Frankel, E. Sadeghian, and S. Savarese. *JRDB: A dataset and benchmark of egocentric robot visual perception of humans in built environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2021.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, V. Bankiti, A.H. Lang, S. Vora, V.E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, P. Y., Baldan, G., and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
