To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Networks for Named Entity Recognition" by Alberto Cetoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will examine the **methods and materials** section, particularly looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they performed experiments on the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset**. I will look for any additional context or details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, or specific features that were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental results** section, I will check if the authors provide any further insights into how the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset** was used, including any specific configurations or splits that were applied during the experiments.

After gathering information about the dataset, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Ralph Weischedel, et al. *OntoNotes Release 5.0*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, LDC2013T19, 2013. Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC2013T19/OntoNotes-Release-5.0.pdf.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **OntoNotes 5.0 dataset**, I will ensure that this dataset is described comprehensively, including its relevance to the research and any specific attributes mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
