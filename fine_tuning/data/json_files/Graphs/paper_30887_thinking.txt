To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Feature-Level Debiased Natural Language Understanding" by Yougang Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on three NLU benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments in **section 4.2 (Datasets)**. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset contains pairs of premise and hypothesis sentences labeled as entailment, neutral, and contradiction. It is used to evaluate models against the challenge dataset HANS.

2. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: Similar to MNLI, this dataset also contains pairs of premise and hypothesis sentences labeled as entailment, neutral, and contradiction. The authors evaluate models trained on SNLI against the Scramble Test challenge set.

3. **FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification)**: This dataset consists of pairs of claim and evidence sentences labeled as support, not-enough-information, or refute. The authors follow a specific processing method for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference. In Proceedings of NAACL, 1112–1122.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 632–642.

- For **FEVER**, the citation is:
  > Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., & Mittal, A. (2018). FEVER: a Large-scale Dataset for Fact Extraction and VERiﬁcation. In Proceedings of NAACL, 809–819.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
