To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thinking Audio-Visual Synchronization for Active Speaker Detection" by Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi, You Zhang, Zhiyao Duan, and Changshui Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **Active Speakers in the Wild (ASW)** dataset and the **AVA Active Speaker (AVA)** dataset. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in the **case study section** and provide specific details about each:

1. **AVA Active Speaker (AVA)**: This dataset is derived from 188 movies, with each movie annotated for active speaker detection at the frame level. It includes face bounding boxes and speaking labels, with a total duration of 15 to 30 minutes per movie. The dataset contains dubbed movies, which are relevant to the study's focus on audio-visual synchronization.

2. **Active Speakers in the Wild (ASW)**: This dataset consists of 30.9 hours of face tracks from 212 YouTube videos, including various contexts such as debates and press conferences. The lengths of the face tracks vary significantly, ranging from 0.2 to 233.0 seconds.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **AVA Active Speaker (AVA)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Joseph Roth, Sourish Chaudhuri, Ondrej Klejch, Radhika Marvin, et al. *AVA Active Speaker: An Audio-Visual Dataset for Active Speaker Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

- For the **Active Speakers in the Wild (ASW)** dataset, the citation is:
  > You Jin Kim, Hee-Soo Heo, Soyeon Choe, Soo-Whan Chung, Yoohwan Kwon, Bong-Jin Lee, Youngki Kwon, and Joon Son Chung. *Look Whoâ€™s Talking: Active Speaker Detection in the Wild*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2021.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
