To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Adversarially Robust Detection of Out-of-Distribution Data (Almost) for Free" by Alexander Meinke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a classifier for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention various approaches to OOD detection but do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they do refer to the importance of evaluating methods on diverse datasets, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains over 600,000 digit images.
4. **LSUN**: A dataset for scene understanding, containing millions of labeled images across various categories.
5. **R.ImgNet**: A restricted version of the ImageNet dataset, focusing on specific classes of animals.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NeurIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **LSUN**:
  > Fisher Yu and Vladlen Koltun. *Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions*. In ICLR, 2016.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
