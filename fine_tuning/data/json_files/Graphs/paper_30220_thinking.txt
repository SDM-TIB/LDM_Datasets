To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Correction in Real-Time Traffic Forecasting" by Daejin Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **METR-LA** and **PEMS-BAY**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **introduction** and **experimental settings** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of traffic forecasting and reference the datasets used for their experiments. 

In **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset contains traffic speed data recorded by 207 sensors on the highways of Los Angeles County. The data was collected over a period of 4 months from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012.

2. **PEMS-BAY**: Collected by California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS), this dataset includes 325 sensor data from the Bay Area, with data collected over 6 months from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2017.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

- For **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

Since both datasets are referenced from the same paper, I will ensure to note that they are derived from the same source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
