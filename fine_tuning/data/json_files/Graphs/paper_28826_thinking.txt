To extract datasets from the research paper titled "United Adversarial Learning for Liver Tumor Segmentation and Detection of Multi-modality Non-contrast MRI" by Jianfeng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for validation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of liver tumor detection and segmentation, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used in their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset and Configurations)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the UAL is validated on a clinical dataset comprising **255 subjects** (125 subjects with hemangioma and 130 subjects with HCC). Each subject has corresponding **T1FS, T2FS, DWI, and multi-phase CEMRI** images collected after standard clinical liver MRI examinations.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the use of multi-phase CEMRI and non-contrast MRI, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. However, they do mention that the segmentation labels were obtained manually according to clinical criteria using the ITK-SNAP tool.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset citations, I will note that the dataset used is a clinical dataset of **255 subjects** with specific imaging modalities but will not be able to provide formal citations for these datasets as they are not explicitly referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets used in the study, ensuring to note the lack of formal citations for the clinical dataset.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, while acknowledging the absence of formal citations for the datasets used in this research.
