To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Gram-SLD: Automatic Self-labeling and Detection for Instance Objects" by Rui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **GMU Kitchen Dataset**, **Active Vision Dataset**, and a self-made dataset called **BHID-ITEM Dataset**. This indicates that there are at least three datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **GMU Kitchen Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9 RGB videos of kitchen scenes, totaling 6728 samples, with a focus on 11 objects. The training set contains 3851 samples, and the test set has 2877 samples.

2. **Active Vision Dataset (AVD)**: The AVD contains 17,556 samples across 15 scenes and 33 instance objects. For the experiments, a subset of 7262 samples with 6 common instance objects was used.

3. **BHID-ITEM Dataset**: This is a self-made dataset designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a real office environment, consisting of 1110 samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
