To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disease Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks: Application to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Alzheimer’s Disease" by Sarah Parisot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework on two large datasets: **ABIDE** and **ADNI**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Databases and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)**: This dataset aggregates neuroimaging and phenotypic data from 1112 subjects across various international sites. The authors mention that they selected a subset of 871 subjects for their analysis, which includes individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy controls.

2. **ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**: This dataset includes data from over 1700 adults aged between 55 and 90 years, focusing on the prediction of conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The authors specifically used a subset of 540 MCI subjects with longitudinal T1 MR images.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ABIDE**, the citation is:
  > Di Martino, A., Yan, C.G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F.X., Alaerts, K., Anderson, J.S., Assaf, M., Bookheimer, S.Y., Dapretto, M., et al. (2014). The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism. *Molecular Psychiatry*, 19, 659.

- For **ADNI**, the citation is:
  > Thompson, P.M., Stein, J.L., Medland, S.E., Hibar, D.P., Vasquez, A.A., Renteria, M.E., Toro, R., Jahanshad, N., Schumann, G., Franke, B., et al. (2014). The enigma consortium: large-scale collaborative analyses of neuroimaging and genetic data. *Brain Imaging and Behavior*, 8, 153.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
