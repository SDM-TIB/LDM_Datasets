To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Anatomical Awareness for Enhanced Generalizability and Progression Prediction in Deep Learning-Based Radiographic Sacroiliitis Detection" by Felix J. Dorfner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves multiple patient cohorts and radiographs, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Cohort Description)**, where the authors describe the imaging data from four different studies. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **PROOF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1483 radiographs from patients diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). It is further divided into training (1261 images) and validation (222 images) sets.

2. **GESPIC Dataset**: This dataset includes 436 patients with axSpA, with radiographs available for inference.

3. **OptiRef Dataset**: This dataset contains 340 images from patients with symptoms suggestive of axSpA, with a mix of diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases.

4. **DAMACT Dataset**: This dataset comprises 163 radiographs from 178 patients with suspected axSpA, also used for inference.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the models tested on these datasets, confirming their use in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PROOF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Denis Poddubnyy, Joachim Sieper, Servet Akar, Santiago Muñoz-Fernández, Hildrun Haibel, Maja Hojnik, Fabiana Ganz, and Robert D Inman. *Characteristics of patients with axial spondyloarthritis by geographic regions: Proof multicountry observational study baseline results*. Rheumatology, 61(8):3299–3308, 8 2022. doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keab901.

- For the **GESPIC Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DAMACT Dataset**, the citation is:

Hermann, Juliane Greese, Carsten Schwenke, Denis Poddubnyy, Bernd Hamm, and Joachim Sieper. *Comparison of MRI with radiography for detecting structural lesions of the sacroiliac joint using CT as standard of reference: results from the SIMACT study*. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, 76(9):1502–1508, 9 2017. doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-210640.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
