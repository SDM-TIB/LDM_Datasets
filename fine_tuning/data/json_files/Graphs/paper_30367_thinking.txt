To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness in Generative Modeling: do it Unsupervised!" by M. Zameshina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Preliminaries)** and **section 5 (Experimental Results)**. These sections often detail the methodologies and experiments conducted, including the datasets utilized.

In **section 2.2 (Image generation: GAN, PGAN, and EvolGan)**, the authors mention using faces generated by **StyleGAN2**. This indicates that the dataset is related to facial images, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Additionally, in **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors discuss various contexts and mention the **CelebaHQ** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for facial image generation and analysis. This is a significant dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **StyleGAN2**: The authors refer to faces generated by StyleGAN2, which is based on the following paper:
   > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

2. **CelebaHQ**: The dataset is referenced in the context of the experiments:
   > CelebA-HQ dataset. Available at: https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately document them in the required format for further processing or review.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any downstream applications or analyses.
