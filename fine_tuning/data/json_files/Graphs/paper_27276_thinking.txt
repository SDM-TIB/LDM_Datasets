To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Active Learning based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Fake News Detection" by Yuxiang Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with **two real-world fake news datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In the section titled **"A. Dataset Description,"** the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PolitiFact Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the PolitiFact platform, which fact-checks news articles. It includes a variety of news articles categorized based on their credibility, with specific counts of fake and real news articles.

2. **BuzzFeed Dataset**: This dataset contains 91 real news articles and 91 fake news articles, used to construct a heterogeneous information network for the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **PolitiFact Dataset**, the citation is:
> PolitiFact. *PolitiFact: A project of the Tampa Bay Times*. Available at: https://www.politifact.com/

For the **BuzzFeed Dataset**, the citation is:
> Shu, K., Wang, S., & Liu, H. (2019). *Beyond news contents: The role of social context for fake news detection*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pages 312â€“320.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
