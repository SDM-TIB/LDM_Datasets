To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inductive Representation Learning in Large Attributed Graphs" by Nesreen K. Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may mention datasets that are relevant to their research. I will take note of any datasets that are described or referenced.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific attributes that are relevant to the study. I will look for tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention datasets such as "biogrid–human" or "soc–dolphins," I will ensure to find their respective citations in the references. If the datasets are derived from other works, I will cite the original papers that introduced these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include details such as the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
