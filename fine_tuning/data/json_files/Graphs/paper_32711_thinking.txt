To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cryptoâ€™Graph: Leveraging Privacy-Preserving Distributed Link Prediction for Robust Graph Learning" by Sofiane Azogagh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Application to graph sanitization)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Polblogs dataset** for their experiments, which is crucial for my dataset extraction. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including how it was generated and its relevance to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they created two subgraphs from the Polblogs dataset. They explain the sampling method used to determine which links belong to each subgraph, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Polblogs dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the style used in the paper, and it is essential to include this for proper attribution.

The citation for the Polblogs dataset is:
> Ryan A. Rossi and Nesreen K. Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In AAAI, 2015. URL: https://networkrepository.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the required format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset identified in the paper.
