To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Connectivity-constrained Interactive Panoptic Segmentation" by Ruobing Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present results on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they present competitive segmentation results on both the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes** validation datasets. They also describe the number of classes and the nature of the annotations used, which confirms their relevance to the study.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their algorithms on these datasets, further solidifying their importance in the research. They discuss the use of superpixels generated from these datasets and how they impact the segmentation results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. M. A. Eslami, L. V. Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 111, no. 1, pp. 98â€“136, Jan 2015.

2. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further study.
