To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UBER-GNN: A User-Based Embeddings Recommendation based on Graph Neural Networks" by Bo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Financial-Include Dataset**: This dataset includes 82,126 commodities, 753,960 transactions, and 91,433 sessions, with an average session length of 8.246.
2. **Financial-Exclude Dataset**: This dataset contains 65,623 commodities, 473,495 transactions, and 76,816 sessions, with an average session length of 6.164.

The authors also provide details about the characteristics of the data, such as the filtering criteria and the time frame for the purchase session data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments and do not have external citations. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are based on real-world transaction data from Ping An Jinguanjia, which is a proprietary dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and ensure to include the context of their origin:

- **Financial-Include Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the real transaction data of Ping An Jinguanjia, which includes various commodities and user transactions over a specified period.
- **Financial-Exclude Dataset**: Similar to the Financial-Include Dataset, this dataset also comes from Ping An Jinguanjia but excludes financial commodities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the source of the datasets as the authors' own experiments with the Ping An Jinguanjia data.

This thorough approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper, along with their descriptions and citations where applicable.
