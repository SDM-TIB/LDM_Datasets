To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAU: A SpatioTemporal-Aware Unit for Video Prediction and Beyond" by Zheng Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or text that explicitly list the datasets along with their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for video prediction tasks, consisting of sequences of moving digits. The authors mention that each sequence contains 20 frames with a resolution of 64 × 64.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is used for various tasks including stereo, optical flow, and object detection. The authors specify that the raw data resolution is 375 × 1242.

3. **Caltech Pedestrian Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 10 hours of video footage for pedestrian detection tasks, with a resolution of 640 × 480.

4. **TownCentreXVID Dataset**: This dataset contains video frames with complex scenarios and higher resolution (1080 × 1920), used for evaluating the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

5. **Something-SomethingV2 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for early action recognition tasks, containing a large collection of labeled video clips showing humans performing predefined actions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Moving MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits,” http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Caltech Pedestrian Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **TownCentreXVID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Benfold and I. Reid, “Stable multi-target tracking in real-time surveillance video,” in *IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog.*, 2011, pp. 3457–3464.

- For the **Something-SomethingV2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Goyal et al., “The ‘Something-Something’ video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense,” in *Int. Conf. Comput. Vis.*, 2017, pp. 5842–5850.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
