To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Representations for Time-varying Brain Datasets" by Sikun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of fMRI and DWI data, which suggests that these might be the datasets of interest. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of modeling brain signals and mention the use of fMRI and DWI modalities. However, I need to find specific datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using the **CRASH dataset** for their experiments, which is crucial for my extraction. I will look for details about this dataset, such as the number of subjects, sessions, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

The paper provides a table (Table 1) that summarizes the details of the fMRI scans used for six tasks, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's structure. I will note down the specifics of the tasks and the number of valid sessions and frames per session.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CRASH dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
> Nina Lauharatanahirun, Kanika Bansal, Steven M Thurman, Jean M Vettel, Barry Giesbrecht, Scott Grafton, James C Elliott, Erin Flynn-Evans, Emily Falk, and Javier O Garcia. *Flexibility of brain regions during working memory curtails cognitive consequences to lack of sleep*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.07233, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **CRASH Dataset**: This dataset includes fMRI signals from 1940 scan sessions across 56 subjects, with varying session lengths. It is used for classifying brain signals into six tasks: resting state, visual working memory task (VWM), dynamic attention task (DYN), dot-probe task (DOT), math task (MOD), and psychomotor vigilance task (PVT).

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the CRASH dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper.
