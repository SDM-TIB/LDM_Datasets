To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Class Graph Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in Attributed Networks" by Xuhong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this case, I find that **section 4.1 (Datasets)** explicitly lists the datasets used in the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Cora**: This dataset consists of 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, with a feature representation based on a sparse bag-of-words model. The dataset is used for node anomaly detection by treating one class as normal and the rest as anomalous.

2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset has 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges, also represented by a sparse bag-of-words feature vector. The normal class is defined as "IR," while the rest are considered anomalous.

3. **Pubmed**: This dataset contains 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, with features derived from a bag-of-words representation. The normal class is "Diabetes Mellitus Type 2," and the rest are treated as anomalous.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

Since the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets are commonly used citation network datasets, they are often referenced in the same way across multiple papers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
