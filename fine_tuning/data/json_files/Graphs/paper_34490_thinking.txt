To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NBgE: a multi-physics-informed encoder leveraging bond graphs" by Alexis-Raja Brachet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on two challenging multi-domain physical systems, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental study)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DC Motor Dataset**: This dataset is a simulated dataset created for a Direct Current Motor, which includes both electrical and mechanical domains. The authors describe the setup and the parameters used for the simulation, indicating that this dataset is fully known and generated through MATLAB SIMULINK.

2. **Respiratory System Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a study by Guy et al. (2023) and involves real measurements from 80 individuals to monitor respiratory diseases. The authors reference this dataset and provide context about its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Respiratory System Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guy, E. F. S., Clifton, J. A., Calj√©-van Der Klei, T., Chen, R., Knopp, J., Moeller, K., and Chase, J. G. (2023). *Respiratory dataset from PEEP study with expiratory occlusion (version 1.0.0)*. PhysioNet.

Since the DC Motor dataset is a simulated dataset created by the authors, it does not have a formal citation like the Respiratory System dataset. However, I will note that it is based on their own simulations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the details are accurate and complete for future reference.
