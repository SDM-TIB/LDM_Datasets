To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Just-in-Time Security Patch Detection - LLM at the Rescue for Data Augmentation" by Xunzhu Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize two datasets, **PatchDB** and **SPI-DB**, for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically looking for details about the datasets. In section 3.1, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **PatchDB**: This dataset comprises 36,000 patches from open-source projects, including 12,000 security-focused patches and 24,000 general patches. It combines patches derived from NVD reference links and GitHub commits from notable projects like Linux and MySQL.

2. **SPI-DB**: This dataset focuses on patches from projects such as Linux and FFmpeg, with 25,790 patches available, including 10,000 security patches and 15,000 non-security patches.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details or clarifications regarding the datasets. In section A.1.1, the authors provide further context about **PatchDB** and **SPI-DB**, confirming their composition and relevance for security patch detection.

Now, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **PatchDB**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Sun, K., Feng, P., Kun, S., Jajodia, S., & Geck, F. (2021). *PatchDB: A large-scale security patch dataset*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), pp. 149–160.

- For **SPI-DB**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Y., Siow, J. K., Wang, C., Liu, S., & Liu, Y. (2021). *SPI: Automated identification of security patches via commits*. ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 31(1), 1–27.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
