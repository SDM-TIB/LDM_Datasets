To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI for Interpretable Chemistry: Predicting Radical Mechanistic Pathways via Contrastive Learning" by Mohammadamin Tavakoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a new reaction predictor system, RMechRP, which utilizes a public database of radical reactions, suggesting that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and the need for a dataset specifically tailored for radical reactions. They mention that the RMechDB dataset is used for training and testing their models, which is a key dataset to note.

In the **data section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the RMechDB dataset. They state that it comprises approximately 5500 radical elementary step reactions sourced from chemistry textbooks and scientific articles on atmospheric chemistry. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides details about its composition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RMechDB dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mohammadamin Tavakoli, Yin Ting T Chiu, Pierre Baldi, Ann Marie Carlton, and David Van Vranken. *RMechDB: A public database of elementary radical reaction steps*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

1. **RMechDB**: This dataset contains approximately 5500 radical elementary step reactions, labeled with different categorizations for comprehensive evaluation of predictive models.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for RMechDB, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
