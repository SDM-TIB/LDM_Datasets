To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boundary-aware Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Nuclei Instance Segmentation" by Ye Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, it does not explicitly name any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of nuclei instance segmentation and the challenges faced in this area. They do not mention specific datasets here, so I will continue to the **methodology** section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Cryosectioned and H&E-stained Nuclei Segmentation (CryoNuSeg)**: This dataset contains 30 images from 10 organs, each with a size of 512 × 512 pixels. The authors specify the data split for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Digestive-System Pathological Segmentation (DigestPath)**: This dataset consists of 69 images of the digestive system, each approximately 1500 × 1200 pixels in size. The authors also provide details on how they split this dataset for training, validation, and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CryoNuSeg**, the citation is:
  > Mahbod, A., Schaefer, G., Bancher, B., Löw, C., Dorffner, G., Ecker, R., & Ellinger, I. (2021). CryoNuSeg: A dataset for nuclei instance segmentation of cryosectioned H&E-stained histological images. *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, 132, 104349.

- For **DigestPath**, the citation is:
  > Da, Q., Huang, X., Li, Z., Zuo, Y., Zhang, C., Liu, J., Chen, W., Li, J., Xu, D., Hu, Z., et al. (2022). DigestPath: A benchmark dataset with challenge review for the pathological detection and segmentation of digestive-system. *Medical Image Analysis*, 80, 102485.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
