To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Listen2Scene: Interactive material-aware binaural sound propagation for reconstructed 3D scenes" by Anton Ratnarajah and Dinesh Manocha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for realistic acoustic effects in virtual environments and mention the use of the **ScanNet dataset** for generating binaural impulse responses (BIRs). This indicates that the ScanNet dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, specifically in **section 3 (Model Representation and Dataset Generation)**, where the authors describe how they create synthetic BIRs using the geometric simulator for real 3D scenes in the ScanNet dataset. They mention preprocessing the 3D meshes and assigning acoustic material properties, which further confirms the use of the ScanNet dataset.

The authors also mention the **BRAS benchmark** in the context of evaluating their approach against captured BIRs. This benchmark is another dataset that is relevant to their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **ScanNet Dataset**:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas A. Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In CVPR. IEEE Computer Society, 2432–2443, 2017.

2. **BRAS Benchmark**:
   > Lukas Aspöck, Michael Vorländer, Fabian Brinkmann, David Ackermann, and Stefan Weinzierl. *Benchmark for Room Acoustical Simulation (BRAS)*. DOI 10 (2020), 14279.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and relevance to the research.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations, ensuring that the details are accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
