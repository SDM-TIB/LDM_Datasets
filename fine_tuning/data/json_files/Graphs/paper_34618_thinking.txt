To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AVFF: Audio-Visual Feature Fusion for Video Deepfake Detection" by Trevine Oorloff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on the **FakeAVCeleb dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Implementation)**, they mention that the representation learning stage uses the **LRS3 dataset**, which contains real videos. This is an important dataset for understanding their approach.

In **section 4.1**, they also specify that the deepfake classification stage utilizes the **FakeAVCeleb dataset**, which is described as containing both real and fake videos. This dataset is essential for evaluating their model's performance.

Additionally, in **section 4.2 (Evaluation and Discussion)**, the authors refer to the **KoDF dataset** for cross-dataset generalization, indicating its relevance in their experiments.

I will now gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **LRS3 Dataset**:
   > Triantafyllos Afouras, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *LRS3-TED: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual Speech Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496, 2018.

2. **FakeAVCeleb Dataset**:
   > Hasam Khalid, Shahroz Tariq, Minha Kim, and Simon S Woo. *FakeAVCeleb: A Novel Audio-Video Multimodal Deepfake Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.05080, 2021.

3. **KoDF Dataset**:
   > Patrick Kwon, Jaeseong You, Gyuhyeon Nam, Sungwoo Park, and Gyeongsu Chae. *KoDF: A Large-Scale Korean Deepfake Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 10744â€“10753, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
