To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Dependency Forest for Neural Medical Relation Extraction" by Linfeng Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two biomedical benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of relation extraction in the medical domain. They mention using two specific datasets for their experiments: **BioCreative VI ChemProt** and **Phenotype-Gene relation (PGR)**. I will take note of these names as they are likely the datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They mention:

1. **BioCreative VI ChemProt (CPR)**: This dataset focuses on the relations between chemical compounds and proteins. It contains 1020 training, 612 development, and 800 testing instances, all manually annotated with entity mentions and relations.

2. **Phenotype-Gene relation (PGR)**: This dataset concerns the relations between human phenotypes and genes, containing 18,451 silver training instances and 220 high-quality test instances.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **BioCreative VI ChemProt**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger, M., Rabal, O., Akhondi, S. A., et al. (2017). Overview of the BioCreative VI Chemical-Protein Interaction Track. In Proceedings of the VI BioCreative Challenge Evaluation Workshop.

- For **Phenotype-Gene relation (PGR)**, the citation is:
  > Sousa, D., Lamurias, A., & Couto, F. M. (2019). A silver standard corpus of human phenotype-gene relations. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
