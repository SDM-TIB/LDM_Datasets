To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning-Based Spin Structure Detection" by Labrie-Boulay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for detecting skyrmions in magnetic microscopy images, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training and evaluation of this model.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention that the training data comprises 1901 images sampled from 19 separate Kerr microscope videos. They also state that the validation set consists of 200 images from 5 different videos, and the test set includes 200 images from 6 different videos. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for training, validation, and testing.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **results and discussion** sections. The authors mention that they added 100 new measurements containing many defects that were properly labeled by hand, which contributes to the dataset used for training the model. This information is crucial for understanding the composition of the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their dataset as "MOKE-microscopy-Skyrmion-dataset," which is available on Zenodo. The citation for this dataset is:

- Winkler, Thomas Brian, Labrie-Boulay, Isaac, Romanova, Alena, Fangohr, Hans, and Kl√§ui, Mathias. *MOKE-microscopy-Skyrmion-dataset*. Zenodo, Feb. 17, 2023. doi: 10.5281/ZENODO.7636109.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Training Dataset**: Comprises 1901 images sampled from 19 separate Kerr microscope videos.
2. **Validation Dataset**: Comprises 200 images taken from 5 different videos.
3. **Test Dataset**: Comprises 200 images from 6 different videos.
4. **Additional Dataset**: 100 new measurements containing many defects, labeled by hand.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

With all this information compiled, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified structure for further processing.
