To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DICNet: Deep Instance-Level Contrastive Network for Double Incomplete Multi-View Multi-Label Classification" by Chengliang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were performed on five datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using five popular multi-view multi-label datasets: **Corel 5k, VOC 2007, ESP Game, IAPR TC-12, and MIR FLICKR**. I will take note of these names as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. This is important because proper citation is required for each dataset entry.

The citations I find for each dataset are as follows:

1. **Corel 5k**:
   > Duygulu, P., Barnard, K., de Freitas, J. F., & Forsyth, D. A. (2002). Object recognition as machine translation: Learning a lexicon for a fixed image vocabulary. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 97-112).

2. **VOC 2007**:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2009). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-308.

3. **ESP Game**:
   > Von Ahn, L., & Dabbish, L. (2004). Labeling images with a computer game. In SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 319-326).

4. **IAPR TC-12**:
   > Grubinger, M., Clough, P., MÃ¼ller, H., & Deselaers, T. (2006). The IAPR TC-12 benchmark: A new evaluation resource for visual information systems. In International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (pp. 1-11).

5. **MIR FLICKR**:
   > Huiskes, M. J., & Lew, M. S. (2008). The MIR Flickr retrieval evaluation. In ACM International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval (pp. 39-43).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
