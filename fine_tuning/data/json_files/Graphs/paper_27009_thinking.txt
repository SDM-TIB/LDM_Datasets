To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating the Instability of Mutual Information-based Losses via Regularization" by Kwanghee Choi and Siyeong Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "novel benchmark that evaluates MI-based losses," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors discuss their benchmarks and mention using **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are part of their evaluation process.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a **one-hot dataset** designed for a specific experiment, which is another dataset to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009. (Note: CIFAR100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR10, and the citation is the same.)

3. **One-hot Dataset**: Since this dataset is specifically designed for the experiments in this paper, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will describe it as follows:
   > One-hot dataset designed for MI estimation tasks, created by the authors for experimental purposes.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
