To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deeply Supervised Depth Map Super-Resolution as Novel View Synthesis" by Xibin Song, Yuchao Dai, and Xueying Qin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various benchmarking datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention using depth maps from the **Middlebury stereo dataset** and the **Sintel dataset**, as well as the **synthetic New Tsukuba dataset**. These are key datasets that need to be documented.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

1. **Middlebury Stereo Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the paper, particularly in the context of clean and noisy depth maps. The citation is:
   > D. Scharstein and R. Szeliski. *A Taxonomy and Evaluation of Dense Two-Frame Stereo Correspondence Algorithms*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 47(1-3): 7-42, 2002.

2. **Sintel Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of depth maps for training and evaluation. The citation is:
   > D. J. Butler, J. Wulff, G. B. Stanley, and M. J. Black. *A Naturalistic Open Source Movie for Optical Flow Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 611-625, 2012.

3. **Synthetic New Tsukuba Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced in the context of training data. The citation is:
   > S. Martull and M. Peris. *Realistic CG Stereo Image Dataset with Ground Truth Disparity Maps*. IEICE Technical Report, 2012, 111(430): 117-118.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
