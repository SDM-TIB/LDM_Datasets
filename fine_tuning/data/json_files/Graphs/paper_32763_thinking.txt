To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank tensor completion via tensor joint rank with logarithmic composite norm" by Hongbing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that "Experiments on various real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly." This indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments, prompting me to look for specific names.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for testing their method. Here, they mention three types of real-world tensor data: **magnetic resonance image (MRI)** data, **multispectral image (MSI)** data, and **color video (CV)** data. I will note these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

1. **MRI Data**: The authors specify that they used MRI data with a size of 181 × 217 × 181. They also provide a link to the dataset: "http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/selection_normal.html".

2. **MSI Data**: The paper mentions using four MSIs from the CAVE dataset, specifically named **clay**, **chart and stuffed toy**, **balloons**, and **cd**, all of size 256 × 256 × 31. The authors provide a link to the dataset: "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/".

3. **CV Data**: The authors used six color videos named **akiyo**, **hall**, **foreman**, **news**, **highway**, and **container**, each of size 144 × 176 × 50. They also provide a link to the dataset: "http://trace.eas.asu.edu/yuv/".

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the field, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will ensure to note the original sources or links provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation or source link. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation or link for reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and formatted.
