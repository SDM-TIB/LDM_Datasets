To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Calcification Morphology and Distribution Analysis in Mammograms" by Hao Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of characterizing microcalcifications in mammograms, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors state that they collected a dataset of **387 mammography images from 200 patients** classified as ACR BI-RADS category 4 and 5. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and is explicitly described.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional details about how the dataset was constructed or any preprocessing steps taken. The authors mention that the dataset was annotated by a senior radiological technologist and reviewed by senior radiologists, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected from an "Anonymous Organization," it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and does not have a publicly available citation.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Mammography Dataset**: Contains 387 mammography images from 200 patients classified as ACR BI-RADS category 4 and 5, with documented calcifications confirmed by biopsy tests.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is from an anonymous organization and does not have a standard reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.
