To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaGNN: Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Frequency Response Filter" by Yushun Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors validate their framework on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using six real-world attributed networks for their experiments, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluations.

I will specifically check **section 4 (Experimental Evaluations)**, where the authors list the datasets used. They mention the following datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset with 5,196 nodes, 173,468 edges, and 8,189 features.
2. **Flickr**: Another social network dataset with 7,575 nodes and 242,146 edges.
3. **ACM**: A co-author network dataset with 16,484 nodes and 71,980 edges.
4. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges.
5. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
6. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them accurately.

For example, the citation for the BlogCatalog dataset is:
> Jundong Li, Xia Hu, Jiliang Tang, and Huan Liu. *Unsupervised streaming feature selection in social media*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, 1041â€“1050, 2015.

Similarly, I will look for citations for the other datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
