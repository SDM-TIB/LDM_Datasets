To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure Aware Negative Sampling in Knowledge Graphs" by Kian Ahrabian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) and negative sampling techniques, which suggests that datasets related to KGs may be discussed. The introduction provides context about the datasets used in the experiments, specifically mentioning **FB15K-237**, **WN18**, and **WN18RR** as datasets utilized for evaluating the proposed methods.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the datasets **FB15K-237**, **WN18**, and **WN18RR**. They provide a brief description of each dataset, including their origins and characteristics.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **FB15K-237**: This dataset is a subset of the FreeBase Knowledge Base, which contains general facts about the world and various relation types. It has 14,541 entities and 237 relation types.

2. **WN18**: This dataset is derived from the WordNet Knowledge Base, which is a large lexical database of English. It contains 40,943 entities and 18 relation types.

3. **WN18RR**: This is a refined version of WN18, also derived from WordNet, with 40,943 entities and 11 relation types.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Kurt Bollacker, Colin Evans, Praveen Paritosh, Tim Sturge, and Jamie Taylor. *Freebase: a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge*. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, pages 1247–1250, 2008.

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 2787–2795, 2013.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Zhiqing Sun, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jian-Yun Nie, and Jian Tang. *Rotate: Knowledge graph embedding by relational rotation in complex space*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
