To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Long-tailed Object Detection with Image-Level Supervision by Multi-Task Collaborative Learning" by Bo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **LVIS dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of long-tailed object detection and reference the **LVIS dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments. This suggests that LVIS is a primary dataset used in their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention that they utilize the **ImageNet-22k dataset** for image-level supervision. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They confirm that the **LVISv1.0 dataset** is used for instance-level supervision, which contains 1203 categories and a total of 100k images. They also mention that they used a subset of the **ImageNet-22k dataset**, which consists of 1,237,737 images with 997 overlapping categories with LVIS.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **LVIS Dataset**:
   > Gupta, A., Dollar, P., & Girshick, R. (2019). *LVIS: A dataset for large vocabulary instance segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5356–5364.

2. **ImageNet-22k Dataset**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

- **LVIS Dataset**: A large vocabulary dataset for object detection and instance segmentation, containing 1203 categories and 100k images.
- **ImageNet-22k Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 1,237,737 images used for image-level supervision, containing 997 overlapping categories with LVIS.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
