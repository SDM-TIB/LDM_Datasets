To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Video Gaze Estimation via Capturing Head-face-eye Spatial-temporal Interaction Context" by Yiran Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **Gaze360 dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the **Gaze360 dataset** as involving 238 subjects under various conditions, with labeled 3D gaze data. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's scope and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Gaze360 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Gaze360 Dataset**: 
  > P. Kellnhofer, A. Recasens, S. Stent, W. Matusik, and A. Torralba. *Gaze360: Physically unconstrained gaze estimation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019, pp. 6912â€“6921.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Gaze360 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Gaze360 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be structured according to the specified format for downstream processing.
