To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GNN4IP: Graph Neural Network for Hardware Intellectual Property Piracy Detection" by Rozhin Yasaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "comprehensive dataset of register transfer level codes and gate-level netlists," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, specifically where the authors discuss the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they gathered RTL codes and gate-level netlists of hardware designs in Verilog format, comprising 50 distinct circuit designs, 143 netlists, and 390 RTL codes. This information is crucial for identifying the datasets.

In the **dataset subsection**, the authors detail that they formed a dataset of 19,094 similar pairs and 66,631 different pairs, dedicating 20% of these pairs for testing and the rest for training. This provides a clear structure of how the datasets were organized and utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own collection and not from previously published datasets, I will note that the citation for the methodology used to gather the data is relevant. The authors reference "Pyverilog," a toolkit used for processing Verilog HDL, which is essential for understanding how the datasets were generated.

The relevant citations are:
- For the Pyverilog toolkit:
  > S. Takamaeda-Yamazaki, “Pyverilog: A python-based hardware design processing toolkit for Verilog HDL,” in International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any tools or methodologies referenced in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
