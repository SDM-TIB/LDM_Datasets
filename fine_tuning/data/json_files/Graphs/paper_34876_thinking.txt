To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLAMP-ViT: Contrastive Data-Free Learning for Adaptive Post-Training Quantization of ViTs" by Akshat Ramachandran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions extensive evaluations across various vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks and contains 50,000 test images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **COCO 2017**: This dataset is utilized for object detection and contains approximately 20,000 test images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755, 2014.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks and includes 3,000 test images across 150 categories. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Xiao, T., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., Torralba, A. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20K dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127, pages 302–321, 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific applications in the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
