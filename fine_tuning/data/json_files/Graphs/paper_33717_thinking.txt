To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CounterCLR: Counterfactual Contrastive Learning with Non-random Missing Data in Recommendation" by Jun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that "Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method," which indicates that datasets are used but does not specify their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **Coat**, **Yahoo! R3**, and **KuaiRec**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors state that all datasets contain biased training data acquired through traditional data collection processes and unbiased test data acquired through randomized controlled trials (Coat, Yahoo! R3), and full exposure of test items (KuaiRec). This provides context on the nature of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they do reference papers that describe them. 

1. For the **Coat dataset**, the citation is:
   > Gao, C., Li, S., Lei, W., Chen, J., Li, B., Jiang, P., He, X., Mao, J., & Chua, T.-S. (2022). Kuairec: A fully-observed dataset and insights for evaluating recommender systems. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM).

2. For the **Yahoo! R3 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yahoo! R3 dataset. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/

3. For the **KuaiRec dataset**, the citation is:
   > KuaiRec dataset. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://kuairec.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
