To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Volumetric Supervised Contrastive Learning for Seismic Semantic Segmentation" by Kiran Kokilepersaud et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of obtaining pixel-level labels for seismic data and the reliance on large amounts of labeled data. This suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors explicitly state that they utilize the publicly available **F3 block dataset** located in the Netherlands. This dataset is crucial as it contains full semantic segmentation annotations of rock structures, which is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the F3 block dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for evaluation. The authors discuss their experimental setup and the performance metrics, which further validates the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the F3 block dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Alaudah et al. (2019a) that introduced this dataset. I will extract the full citation from the references:

- For the **F3 block dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alaudah, Y., Di, H., and AlRegib, G. (2019a). *A machine-learning benchmark for facies classification*. Interpretation, 7, SE175â€“SE187.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **F3 Block Dataset**: This dataset contains full semantic segmentation annotations of rock structures and is used for training and testing in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
