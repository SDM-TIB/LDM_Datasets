To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks in Recommender Systems: A Survey" by Shiwen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses various recommendation tasks and mentions the use of datasets like MovieLens, Amazon, and Yelp, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections throughout the paper. In this case, I find that **Section 8** is specifically dedicated to datasets, where the authors summarize commonly adopted datasets for GNN-based recommendation tasks.

In **Table 2** of Section 8, the authors list several datasets along with the tasks they are used for. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **MovieLens Datasets**: 
   - **MovieLens-100K**: A dataset containing 100,000 ratings from MovieLens.
   - **MovieLens-1M**: A dataset containing 1 million ratings.
   - **MovieLens-20M**: A dataset containing 20 million ratings.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: 
   - A dataset that includes reviews, product metadata, and links between products.
   - Citation: 
     > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Millions of Ratings to Realistic Recommendations*. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 2013.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: 
   - A dataset containing user check-ins and reviews.
   - Citation: 
     > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

4. **Gowalla Dataset**: 
   - A check-in dataset from the Gowalla application.
   - Citation: 
     > J. Cho, S. A. Myers, and J. Leskovec. *Friendship and Mobility: User Movement in Location-Based Social Networks*. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2011.

5. **Yoochoose Dataset**: 
   - A dataset from the RecSys Challenge 2015 containing user clicks on an e-commerce website.
   - Citation: 
     > RecSys Challenge 2015. *Yoochoose Dataset*. http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html.

6. **Diginetica Dataset**: 
   - A dataset provided by CIKM Cup 2016 containing transactional data.
   - Citation: 
     > CIKM Cup 2016. *Diginetica Dataset*. http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup.

7. **RetailRocket Dataset**: 
   - A dataset from a real-world e-commerce website containing user browsing activities.
   - Citation: 
     > RetailRocket. *E-commerce Dataset*. https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

8. **LastFM Dataset**: 
   - A dataset containing user listening information and artist attributes.
   - Citation: 
     > Last.fm. *Last.fm Dataset*. http://mtg.upf.edu/static/datasets/last.fm/lastfm-dataset-1K.tar.gz.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately as they are critical for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
