To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence-aware Contrastive Learning for Selective Classification" by Yu-Chang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are conducted on "typical datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, and ImageNet." This indicates that these datasets are used in the study.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. The authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments, which are:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing images across 10 categories, with 5,000 images per category.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 categories, each containing 500 images.
3. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset consisting of over 200,000 celebrity images.
4. **ImageNet**: A dataset with 1,000 categories of images, with approximately 1,300 images per category.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., and Tang, X. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730–3738, Santiago, Chile, 2015.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255, Miami, FL, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
