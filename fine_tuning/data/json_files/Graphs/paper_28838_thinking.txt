To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Non-Local Contrastive Attention for Image Super-Resolution" by Bin Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experiments section typically details the datasets employed for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of single image super-resolution (SISR) and reference previous works, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for training and several standard benchmarks for testing, including **Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100, and Manga109**. 

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 800 high-resolution images used for training the models.
2. **Set5**: A benchmark dataset containing 5 images used for evaluating super-resolution methods.
3. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset with 14 images, commonly used in super-resolution research.
4. **B100**: A dataset consisting of 100 images used for testing super-resolution algorithms.
5. **Urban100**: A dataset with 100 images of urban scenes, used for evaluating the performance of super-resolution methods.
6. **Manga109**: A dataset containing 109 manga images, used for testing super-resolution techniques.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the research paper.
