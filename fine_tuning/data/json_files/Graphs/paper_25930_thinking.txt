To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" by Liang Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "multiple benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of text classification and mentions various applications, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention five benchmark corpora:

1. **20-Newsgroups (20NG)**: This dataset contains 18,846 documents categorized into 20 different categories, with a training set of 11,314 documents and a test set of 7,532 documents.

2. **Ohsumed**: This corpus consists of 13,929 unique abstracts from the MEDLINE database, focusing on cardiovascular diseases. After filtering for single-label documents, it retains 7,400 documents, with 3,357 in the training set and 4,043 in the test set.

3. **R8**: A subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, R8 includes 5,485 training documents and 2,189 test documents across 8 categories.

4. **R52**: Another subset of Reuters 21578, R52 has 6,532 training documents and 2,568 test documents across 52 categories.

5. **Movie Review (MR)**: This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification, containing 5,331 positive and 5,331 negative reviews.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **20-Newsgroups**, the citation is:
  > Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning* (ICML), 331-339.

- For **Ohsumed**, the citation is:
  > Hersh, W. R., et al. (1994). Ohsumed: An interactive retrieval evaluation and new test collection for medical information retrieval. In *Proceedings of the 17th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, 192-201.

- For **Reuters 21578**, the citation is:
  > Lewis, D. D., et al. (2004). Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection. *Linguistic Data Consortium*.

- For **Movie Review (MR)**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In *Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics* (ACL), 115-124.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
