To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Game of Trojans: Adaptive Adversaries Against Output-based Trojaned-Model Detectors" by Dinuka Sahabandu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four diverse datasets: **MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SpeechCommand**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they describe each dataset as follows:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset contains 70,000 28 × 28 gray-scale images of hand-written digits, with 60,000 used for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 RGB images of 10 different objects (e.g., car, horse).

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but it has 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

4. **SpeechCommand**: This dataset includes 30,769 training and 4,074 testing files of one-second audio recordings for specific commands.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., University of Toronto.

- For **SpeechCommand**, the citation is:
  > Warden, P. (2018). Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or processing.
