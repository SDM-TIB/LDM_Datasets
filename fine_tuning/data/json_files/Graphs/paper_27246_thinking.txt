To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Spatial-Adaptive Interpolation with Deformable Refinement for Electron Microscopic Images" by Zejin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of electron microscopic (EM) images and hints at the use of a specific dataset for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **CREMI dataset**, which is divided into three sub-datasets: **cremi triplet A, cremi triplet B, and cremi triplet C**. The authors describe how they processed the CREMI dataset to create these triplets for training.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CREMI dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is provided by the MICCAI 2016 Challenge and can be accessed at https://cremi.org/. However, they do not provide a formal citation in the references, so I will note that the dataset is associated with the challenge.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **CREMI Dataset**: This dataset is used for EM image interpolation and is divided into three sub-datasets: cremi triplet A, cremi triplet B, and cremi triplet C. Each triplet consists of three consecutive EM images with a resolution of 512 Ã— 512.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the CREMI dataset in the references, I will note the challenge as the source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the source of the dataset.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the CREMI dataset, and I will ensure to mention its source as the MICCAI 2016 Challenge.
