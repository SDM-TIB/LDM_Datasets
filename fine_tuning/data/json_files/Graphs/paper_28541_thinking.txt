To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Graph Contrastive Learning: Data Augmentation Composition May Not be Necessary for Graph Representation Learning" by Yuxiang Ren and Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **9 benchmark datasets for graph-level representation learning** and **3 benchmark datasets for node-level representation learning**.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets used for graph-level representation learning:
1. **NCI1**: A dataset of biochemical molecules used for graph classification.
2. **PROTEINS**: Another dataset of biochemical molecules for graph classification.
3. **D&D**: A dataset related to biochemical molecules.
4. **MUTAG**: A dataset for graph classification.
5. **COLLAB**: A dataset from social networks.
6. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset for graph classification.
7. **IMDB-MULTI**: Another dataset for graph classification.
8. **RDT-BINARY**: A dataset from social networks.
9. **RDT-MULTI-5K**: Another dataset from social networks.

For node-level representation learning, the authors mention the following datasets:
1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset related to biomedical literature.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly provided for datasets, but I will look for any references that correspond to the datasets mentioned.

For example, the citation for the **NCI1 dataset** is:
> Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TU-Dataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663.

The citation for the **PROTEINS dataset** is:
> Borgwardt, K. M., & Kriegel, H. P. (2005). Shortest-path kernels on graphs. In Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), 2005.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I gather the full citations for all datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset, ensuring that all information is accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
