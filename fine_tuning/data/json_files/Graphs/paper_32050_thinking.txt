To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Revisiting Event Argument Extraction: Can EAE Models Learn Better When Being Aware of Event Co-occurrences?" by Yuxin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with **four datasets**: ACE05, RAMS, WikiEvents, and MLEE. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset:

1. **ACE05**: This dataset is described as an annotated information extraction corpus of newswire, broadcast news, and telephone conversations. It is specifically used for sentence-level event argument extraction (EAE).

2. **RAMS**: This dataset consists of 9,124 annotated events from English online news and is used for document-level EAE. The authors mention that events are aggregated into one instance when they occur in the same context.

3. **WikiEvents**: This dataset includes events recorded in English Wikipedia along with linking news articles. It is also a document-level EAE dataset.

4. **MLEE**: This dataset contains manually annotated abstracts of biomedical publications. It is also used for document-level event extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ACE05**, the citation is:
  > George R. Doddington, Alexis Mitchell, Mark A. Przybocki, Lance A. Ramshaw, Stephanie M. Strassel, and Ralph M. Weischedel. *The automatic content extraction (ace) program tasks, data, and evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2004).

- For **RAMS**, the citation is:
  > Seth Ebner, Patrick Xia, Ryan Culkin, Kyle Rawlins, and Benjamin Van Durme. *Multi-sentence argument linking*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 8057–8077, Online, 2020.

- For **WikiEvents**, the citation is:
  > Sha Li, Heng Ji, and Jiawei Han. *Document-level event argument extraction by conditional generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 894–908, Online, 2021.

- For **MLEE**, the citation is:
  > Sampo Pyysalo, Tomoko Ohta, Makoto Miwa, Han-Cheol Cho, Jun’ichi Tsujii, and Sophia Ananiadou. *Event extraction across multiple levels of biological organization*. Bioinformatics, 28(18):i575–i581, 2012.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
