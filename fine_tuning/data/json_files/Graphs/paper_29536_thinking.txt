To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Recognition of Speakers for Consent Management by Contrastive Embedding Replay" by Arash Shahmansoori and Utz Roedig, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for a consent management mechanism using speaker recognition, which suggests that datasets related to voice recordings may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **LibriSpeech dataset** for their experiments. They specify that different subsets of this dataset are used for training and testing, particularly mentioning the selection of speakers based on their word error rates.

In the **experiments section**, they detail how they utilize the LibriSpeech dataset, indicating that they selected 40 different speakers from the "clean" subset for training and 20 speakers from the "other" subset for dynamic registration. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The citation is as follows:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing in the context of speaker recognition for consent management. It includes various subsets based on the quality of recordings (clean and noisy).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
