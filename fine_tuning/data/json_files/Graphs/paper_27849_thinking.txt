To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLCC: Contrastive Learning for Color Constancy" by Yi-Chen Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method's performance on the **NUS-8 dataset** and the **Gehler dataset**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that the **NUS-8 dataset** consists of 1736 linear raw-RGB images captured by 8 cameras, and the **Gehler dataset** has 568 linear raw-RGB images captured by 2 cameras. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **NUS-8 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dongliang Cheng, Dilip K Prasad, and Michael S Brown. *Illuminant estimation for color constancy: why spatial-domain methods work and the role of the color distribution*. JOSA A, 2014.

- For the **Gehler dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter V. Gehler, Carsten Rother, Andrew Blake, Thomas P. Minka, and Toby Sharp. *Bayesian color constancy revisited*. In 2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2008), 24-26 June 2008, Anchorage, Alaska, USA.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
