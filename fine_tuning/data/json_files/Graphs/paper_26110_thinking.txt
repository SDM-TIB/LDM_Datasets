To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hallucinating Optical Flow Features for Video Classification" by Yongyi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a motion hallucination network (MoNet) for video classification, but it does not specify any datasets at this point. The introduction discusses the challenges of video classification and mentions two-stream models but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **Kinetics-400 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the methodology. In the methodology, the authors describe the Kinetics-400 dataset as containing over 300,000 video clips with 400 different human action labels. This is a significant dataset for video classification tasks.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **YouTube-8M dataset** for evaluating their model. This dataset consists of 6 million YouTube videos with an average of 3 labels per video. This information is essential for understanding the scope of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Kinetics-400 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint 1705.06950, 2017.

2. For the **YouTube-8M dataset**, the citation is:
   > Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. *Youtube-8m: A large-scale video classification benchmark*. arXiv preprint 1609.08675, 2016.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
