To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MiniConGTS: A Near Ultimate Minimalist Contrastive Grid Tagging Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction" by Qiao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two canonical ASTE datasets derived from the SemEval Challenges:

1. **Aspect-oriented Fine-grained Opinion Extraction (AFOE) dataset**: This dataset is introduced by Wu et al. (2020a) and is used for aspect sentiment triplet extraction tasks.

2. **Refined version dataset**: This dataset is a refined version based on the work of Xu et al. (2020), which builds upon the original SemEval datasets.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AFOE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ying, C., Zhao, F., Fan, Z., Dai, X., & Xia, R. (2020). *Grid tagging scheme for aspect-oriented fine-grained opinion extraction*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 2576–2585.

- For the **refined version dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, L., Li, W., Bing, L., Huang, F., Lu, W., & Si, L. (2020). *Knowing what, how and why: A near complete solution for aspect-based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages 8600–8607.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
