To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Granularity Semantic Aware Graph Model for Reducing Position Bias in Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction" by Yinan Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the ECPE task and mention existing works but do not specify datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they describe their approach and any datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they use the benchmark dataset released by Xia and Ding (2019) for their experiments. This is a crucial piece of information indicating that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will look for the full citation of this dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in the experiments:
  > Rui Xia and Zixiang Ding. *Emotion-cause pair extraction: A new task to emotion analysis in texts*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 1003–1012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset is constructed based on an emotion cause extraction corpus that contains 1,945 Chinese documents from SINA city news.
   - **Citation**: Rui Xia and Zixiang Ding. *Emotion-cause pair extraction: A new task to emotion analysis in texts*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 1003–1012.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately extracted the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
