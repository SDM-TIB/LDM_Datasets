To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased and Robust: External Attention-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation" by Xinhua Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DOUBAN**: This dataset is described as a cross-domain dataset with a significant gap in interaction density between two domains. It includes statistics such as the number of items, interactions, and overlapped users.

2. **AMAZON**: Another cross-domain dataset, but with a smaller gap in interaction density compared to DOUBAN. Similar statistics are provided for this dataset as well.

In this section, the authors also provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of both datasets, including the number of items, interactions, density, overlapped users, training sequences, and testing sequences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves may not have specific citations if they are commonly used datasets in the field. In this case, I will note that the datasets are referenced as follows:

- For **DOUBAN**, the citation is:
  > Guo, L., Zhang, J., Tang, L., Chen, T., Zhu, L., & Yin, H. (2022). Time interval-enhanced graph neural network for shared-account cross-domain sequential recommendation. *TNNLs*.

- For **AMAZON**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, H., Duan, H., Guo, L., Xu, L., & Wang, X. (2023). Towards lightweight cross-domain sequential recommendation via external attention-enhanced graph convolution network. In *DASFAA*, pp. 205â€“220.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
