To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NLPre: a revised approach towards language-centric benchmarking of Natural Language Preprocessing systems" by Martyna Wiącek et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a benchmarking system and conducted evaluations based on a specific benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (NLPre-PL benchmark)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

In this section, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **NKJP1M**: This dataset is a subcorpus of the Polish National Corpus, manually annotated according to the NKJP tagset and modified to align with the Morfeusz tagset. It is used for training Polish POS taggers and is available in multiple formats, including TEI and CoNLL.

2. **PDB-UD**: The Polish Dependency Bank is the largest collection of Polish sentences annotated with dependency trees, converted into Universal Dependencies (UD) representations. This dataset is typically used for training NLPre systems for Polish.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NKJP1M**, the citation is:
  > Adam Przepiórkowski, Mirosław Bańko, Rafał L. Górski, and Barbara Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk. *Narodowy Korpus Języka Polskiego*. Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warsaw, 2012.

- For **PDB-UD**, the citation is:
  > Alina Wróblewska. *Polish Dependency Bank (UD Polish-PDB)*. Universal Dependencies Consortium. PID http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-5150.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
