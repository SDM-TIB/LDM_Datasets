To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Feature and Metric Learning for Relation Extraction" by Mi Zhang and Tieyun Qian, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets for various types of relation extraction tasks. This indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **PubMed Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 6987 ternary instances about drug-gene-mutation relations and 6087 binary instances about drug-mutation sub-relations.

2. **SemEval 2010 Task 8 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,000 instances for training and 2,171 instances for testing, containing 9 directed relations and a special "Other" class.

3. **TACRED Dataset**: This dataset has over 106k instances and contains 41 relation types along with a special "no relation" class.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by cross-referencing them with the **results section** where the authors discuss their findings based on these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **PubMed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng, N., Poon, H., Quirk, C., Toutanova, K., & Yih, W. (2017). Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph LSTMs. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 5, 101-115.

- For the **SemEval 2010 Task 8 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., O'Seaghdha, D., Pado, S., Pennacchiotti, M., Romano, L., & Szpakowicz, S. (2010). Semeval-2010 task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals. In *Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2010)*, 33-38.

- For the **TACRED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Qi, P., & Manning, C. D. (2018). Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves relation extraction. In *Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*, 2205-2215.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
