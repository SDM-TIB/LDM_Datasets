To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Networks: analysis, improvements and results" by Ihsan Ullah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The authors state that they present extensive results on four state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context for their work. They mention the use of several semi-supervised classification datasets that are commonly used by other researchers. This suggests that the datasets will be detailed in the subsequent sections.

I will then navigate to **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for performance evaluation. They mention four datasets: **Cora**, **Cora-ML**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. Each dataset is described with its respective statistics, such as the number of nodes, classes, edges, features, and label mismatch rates.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will compile the information provided in **table 4**, which summarizes the dataset statistics:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Nodes: 2708
   - Classes: 7
   - Edges: 5429
   - Features: 1433
   - Label Mismatch: 0.002

2. **Cora-ML**: 
   - Nodes: 2995
   - Classes: 7
   - Edges: 8416
   - Features: 2879
   - Label Mismatch: 0.018

3. **Citeseer**: 
   - Nodes: 3327
   - Classes: 6
   - Edges: 4372
   - Features: 3703
   - Label Mismatch: 0.003

4. **Pubmed**: 
   - Nodes: 19717
   - Classes: 3
   - Edges: 44338
   - Features: 500
   - Label Mismatch: 0.0

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them accurately.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:

- For **Cora-ML**, the citation is:

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its statistics and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
