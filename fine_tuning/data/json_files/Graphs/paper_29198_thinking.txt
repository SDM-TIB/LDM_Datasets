To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-view Multi-behavior Contrastive Learning in Recommendation" by Yiqing Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world MBR datasets on E-commerce," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Tmall, a major E-commerce platform in China. It includes 22,014 users and 27,155 items, with various behaviors recorded: 83,778 purchase behaviors, 44,717 add-to-cart behaviors, and 485,483 click behaviors.

2. **CIKM2019 EComm AI Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the CIKM2019 EComm AI challenge. It consists of 23,032 users, 25,054 items, and includes 100,529 purchase behaviors, 38,347 add-to-cart behaviors, and 276,750 click behaviors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers or publications in the references, which is common for proprietary datasets like those from E-commerce platforms.

Since the Tmall dataset is widely recognized in the field, I can provide a general citation format for it, but it may not have a formal citation like academic datasets. The CIKM2019 EComm AI dataset is also typically referenced in the context of the challenge it was associated with.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any available citations.

1. **Tmall Dataset**:
   - Description: Collected from Tmall, it contains 22,014 users and 27,155 items, with 83,778 purchase behaviors, 44,717 add-to-cart behaviors, and 485,483 click behaviors.
   - Citation: Tmall dataset is commonly referenced in E-commerce research but does not have a formal citation.

2. **CIKM2019 EComm AI Dataset**:
   - Description: Provided by the CIKM2019 EComm AI challenge, it includes 23,032 users, 25,054 items, and 100,529 purchase behaviors, 38,347 add-to-cart behaviors, and 276,750 click behaviors.
   - Citation: CIKM2019 EComm AI dataset is typically referenced in the context of the challenge but does not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
