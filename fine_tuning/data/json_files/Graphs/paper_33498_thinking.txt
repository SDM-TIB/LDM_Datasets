To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Community Detection and Graph Neural Network Based Link Prediction Approach for Scientific Literature" by Chunjiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves link prediction in scientific literature networks, which suggests that datasets related to scientific publications may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. Here, they mention using the **Web of Science database** to construct a dataset focused on zinc batteries. The authors specify that they retrieved **10,187 research articles** using a specific search strategy based on keywords related to zinc batteries. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In this section, I will also note the details about the dataset, including the time frame of the articles (up to November 2023) and the journals from which the articles were sourced. This information is crucial for understanding the context and relevance of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **train-test split** details mentioned in the paper. The authors describe how they created a network graph from the edge dataset and split it into training and test sets with an **80:20 ratio**, resulting in **296,574 samples** for training and **74,144 samples** for testing. This information is important for understanding how the dataset was prepared for analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Web of Science** as the source of their dataset, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can cite the Web of Science as follows:

- **Web of Science**: Clarivate Analytics. *Web of Science*. Available online: https://www.webofscience.com/

Since the dataset is based on articles retrieved from the Web of Science, I will also include a citation for a relevant article that discusses zinc batteries, which is representative of the dataset:

- **Zinc Battery Overview**: Shi, Y., Chen, Y., Li, L., Wang, B., & Ding, S. (2020). An Overview and Future Perspectives of Rechargeable Zinc Batteries. *Small*, 16(23), e2000730. DOI: 10.1002/smll.202000730.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
