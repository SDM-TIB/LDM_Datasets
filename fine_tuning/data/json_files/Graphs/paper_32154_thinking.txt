To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Models of Adversarial Agent Behavior under Partial Observability" by Sean Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two large-scale domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two domains: **Narco Traffic Interdiction** and **Prison Escape**. I will look for specific datasets associated with these domains.

In the **datasets subsection**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **Narco Traffic Interdiction Datasets**:
   - **Smuggler-Low**: This dataset has an opponent detection rate of 13.8%.
   - **Smuggler-High**: This dataset has an opponent detection rate of 31.5%.

2. **Prison Escape Datasets**:
   - **Prisoner-Low**: This dataset has an opponent detection rate of 12.9%.
   - **Prisoner-Medium**: This dataset has an opponent detection rate of 44.0%.
   - **Prisoner-High**: This dataset has an opponent detection rate of 63.1%.

The authors state that for each dataset, they collected 450 rollouts initialized by different random seeds and split them into train, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely created by the authors for the purpose of this research, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are open-sourced and available at the provided GitHub link.

The relevant citations for the datasets will be:

- **Narco Traffic Interdiction Datasets**:
  - Smuggler-Low: Dataset available at https://github.com/CORE-Robotics-Lab/Opponent-Modeling
  - Smuggler-High: Dataset available at https://github.com/CORE-Robotics-Lab/Opponent-Modeling

- **Prison Escape Datasets**:
  - Prisoner-Low: Dataset available at https://github.com/CORE-Robotics-Lab/Opponent-Modeling
  - Prisoner-Medium: Dataset available at https://github.com/CORE-Robotics-Lab/Opponent-Modeling
  - Prisoner-High: Dataset available at https://github.com/CORE-Robotics-Lab/Opponent-Modeling

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or processing.
