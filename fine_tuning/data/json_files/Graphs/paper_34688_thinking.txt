To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAG-based Crowdsourcing Task Decomposition via Masked Contrastive Learning with Prompts" by Jing Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **ACE 2005** and **FewEvent** datasets. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset:
1. **ACE 2005**: This dataset is widely used for event detection and includes a diverse array of news sources with various event types and subtypes.
2. **FewEvent**: This dataset is noted as the largest few-shot dataset for event detection, covering multiple event types and subtypes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **ACE 2005**, the citation is:
  > D. Ahn, “The stages of event extraction,” in Proceedings of the Workshop on Annotating and Reasoning about Time and Events, 2006, pp. 1–8.

- For **FewEvent**, the citation is:
  > S. Deng, N. Zhang, J. Kang, Y. Zhang, W. Zhang, and H. Chen, “Meta-learning with dynamic-memory-based prototypical network for few-shot event detection,” in Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 2020, pp. 151–159.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
