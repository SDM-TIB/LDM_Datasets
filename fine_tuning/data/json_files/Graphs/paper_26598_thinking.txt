To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Graph Learning for Semi-Supervised Classification" by Guangfeng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset includes 7 classes with 2,708 publications represented as nodes in a graph, based on the presence or absence of words in a learned directory.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6 classes involving 3,327 scientific papers, described similarly to the Cora dataset.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset contains 3 classes with 19,717 diabetes-related publications, represented using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and their relevance graph.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset includes 10 classes of handwritten digits, with 10,000 images selected for evaluation.

5. **Cifar10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 classes of natural images, totaling 50,000 images, with 10,000 images selected for evaluation.

The authors provide specific details about the number of classes, training, validation, and testing splits for each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their experimental setup.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- **Cora Dataset**:

- **Cifar10 Dataset**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Tech. rep.*, Citeseer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
