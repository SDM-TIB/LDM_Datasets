To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Reflect and to Beamform for Intelligent Reflecting Surface with Implicit Channel Estimation" by Tao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their simulations or evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the analysis or comparisons made with other methods. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets identified earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" in the experiments, I will look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
