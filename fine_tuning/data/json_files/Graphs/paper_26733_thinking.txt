To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoCo: Local Contrastive Representation Learning" by Yuwen Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors show results on "standard ImageNet experiments" and "complex downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation." This indicates that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. They mention evaluating their method on the **ImageNet-1K** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. I will note this down as it is explicitly mentioned.

Continuing in section 5, the authors also refer to the **MS-COCO** dataset for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. This is another significant dataset widely used in the computer vision community. I will document this as well.

Additionally, they mention the **Cityscapes** dataset in the context of semantic urban scene understanding, which is relevant for evaluating the performance of their model on urban scene segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
   > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. J. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

3. For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
   > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
