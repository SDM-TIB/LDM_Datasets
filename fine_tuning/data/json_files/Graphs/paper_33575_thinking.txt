To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple and Asymmetric Graph Contrastive Learning without Augmentations" by Teng Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and others** that are commonly used in graph-related research. I will also check for any new datasets introduced by the authors, such as **Roman-empire** and **arXiv-year**, as these may have specific citations associated with them.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **Cora dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
