To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAMBranch: Contrastive Learning with Augmented MILPs for Branching" by Jiacheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "expert samples for imitation learning," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of collecting expert samples for imitation learning. They specifically mention collecting 100k expert samples for four combinatorial optimization problems. This indicates that these problems are associated with specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the benchmarks used for evaluation. They mention four NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems:

1. **Set Covering Problem**: This problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to cover a finite set with the minimum number of subsets.

2. **Combinatorial Auction Problem**: This problem involves allocating bids to maximize revenue, which indicates the presence of a dataset related to bids and items.

3. **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**: This problem focuses on minimizing costs while satisfying customer demands, suggesting a dataset that includes facility costs and customer demands.

4. **Maximum Independent Set Problem**: This problem involves finding the largest independent set in a graph, indicating a dataset related to graph structures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or the foundational papers that describe these problems. The citations for the problems are as follows:

- For the **Set Covering Problem**, the citation is:
  > E. Balas. "Set covering algorithms using cutting planes, heuristics, and subgradient optimization: A computational study." *Mathematical Programming Study*, 12:37–60, 1980.

- For the **Combinatorial Auction Problem**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Leyton-Brown, Mark Pearson, and Yoav Shoham. "Towards a universal test suite for combinatorial auction algorithms." In *Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (EC-00)*, 2000.

- For the **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**, the citation is:
  > G. Cornuejols, R. Sridharan, and J. M. Thizy. "A comparison of heuristics and relaxations for the capacitated plant location problem." *European Journal of Operational Research*, 50(3):280–297, 1991.

- For the **Maximum Independent Set Problem**, the citation is:
  > Cire and Andre Augusto. "Decision diagrams for optimization." *Constraints*, 20(4):494–495, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
