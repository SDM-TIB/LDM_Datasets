To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design as Desired: Utilizing Visual Question Answering for Multimodal Pre-training" by Tongkun Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset for experiments, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of multimodal pre-training and mention that their framework is applied to four downstream tasks across five datasets. This hints at multiple datasets being involved, so I need to look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used. They mention constructing a dataset for ultrasound images and reports, which consists of **10,720 ultrasound images and 5,360 reports** specifically for breast and thyroid examinations. This dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Additionally, the authors refer to three public datasets used for visual recognition tasks: **BUSI**, **AUITD**, and **DDTI**. I will need to gather details about these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Ultrasound Dataset**: The citation for the constructed dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in the paper as comprising 10,720 ultrasound images and 5,360 reports for breast and thyroid examinations.

2. **BUSI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Al-Dhabyani, W., Gomaa, M., Khaled, H., Fahmy, A. (2020). Dataset of breast ultrasound images. *Data in brief*, 28, 104863.

3. **AUITD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Maroua, A. (2022). Algerian ultrasound images thyroid dataset: AUITD. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/azouzmaroua/datasets, accessed on February 10, 2023.

4. **DDTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pedraza, L., Vargas, C., Narváez, F., et al. (2015). An open access thyroid ultrasound image database. In *10th International symposium on medical information processing and analysis* (Vol. 9287, pp. 188–193). SPIE.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Ultrasound Dataset**: 10,720 ultrasound images and 5,360 reports for breast and thyroid examinations.
- **BUSI Dataset**: A dataset of breast ultrasound images.
- **AUITD Dataset**: An Algerian ultrasound images thyroid dataset.
- **DDTI Dataset**: An open access thyroid ultrasound image database.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
