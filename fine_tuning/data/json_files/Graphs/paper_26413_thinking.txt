To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAGNN: Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding" by Xinyu Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments: **IMDb**, **DBLP**, and **Last.fm**.

1. **IMDb Dataset**: The paper describes it as an online database about movies and television programs, containing 4,278 movies, 2,081 directors, and 5,257 actors. The dataset is used for node classification tasks, with movies labeled into three classes based on genre.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a computer science bibliography website, containing 4,057 authors, 14,328 papers, 7,723 terms, and 20 publication venues. It is also used for node classification tasks.

3. **Last.fm Dataset**: This dataset is used for link prediction tasks and consists of 1,892 users, 17,632 artists, and 1,088 artist tags.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them in the dataset descriptions.

- For the **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
  > IMDb. *IMDb: The Internet Movie Database*. https://www.imdb.com/

- For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. *DBLP: Computer Science Bibliography*. https://dblp.uni-trier.de/

- For the **Last.fm dataset**, the citation is:
  > Last.fm. *Last.fm Dataset*. https://www.last.fm/

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
