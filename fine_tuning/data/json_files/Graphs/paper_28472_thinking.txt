To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text-Based Person Search with Limited Data" by Xiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **CUHK-PEDES dataset**. This indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In Section 4.1, the authors provide a description of the **CUHK-PEDES dataset**, stating that it contains 40,206 images of 13,003 different people, with each image having two descriptive sentences. This section confirms that the CUHK-PEDES dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUHK-PEDES dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Shuang Li, Tong Xiao, Hongsheng Li, Bolei Zhou, Dayu Yue, and Xiaogang Wang. *Person search with natural language description*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2017â€“2025, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CUHK-PEDES dataset and does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize my findings.

I will create an entry for the CUHK-PEDES dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry I need to prepare based on the information extracted from the paper.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to format it according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
