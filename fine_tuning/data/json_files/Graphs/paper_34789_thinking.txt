To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "TopoGCL: Topological Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yuzhou Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the TopoGCL model was validated on **12 benchmark datasets from biology, chemistry, and social sciences**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for validation. In this section, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **NCI1**: A chemical compound dataset.
2. **MUTAG**: A dataset of chemical compounds.
3. **DHFR**: Another chemical compound dataset.
4. **BZR**: A dataset of chemical compounds.
5. **COX2**: A dataset of chemical compounds.
6. **DD**: A molecular compound dataset.
7. **PROTEINS**: A molecular compound dataset.
8. **PTC MR**: A molecular compound dataset.
9. **PTC FM**: Another molecular compound dataset.
10. **IMDB-BINARY (IMDB-B)**: An internet movie database dataset.
11. **IMDB-MULTI (IMDB-M)**: Another internet movie database dataset.
12. **REDDIT-BINARY (REDDIT-B)**: A dataset from Reddit discussion threads.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **NCI1**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
