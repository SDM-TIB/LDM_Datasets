To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting West Nile Virus with Graph Neural Networks: Harnessing Spatial Dependence in Irregularly Sampled Geospatial Data" by Adam Tonks et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction gives context about the West Nile virus and its significance, but I need to focus on the sections that specifically mention datasets.

In the **Data section**, the authors describe the dataset provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). They mention that this dataset contains **133,867 observations from 2008 to 2021**, detailing the testing of mosquito traps. This section is crucial as it provides specific information about the dataset, including the number of observations, the type of mosquitoes collected, and the variables included.

The authors also explain that after filtering out traps tested infrequently, the dataset was reduced to **81,481 observations** and **333 unique trap locations**. This indicates that the dataset is not only large but also has been processed to ensure quality.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Illinois Department of Public Health. *West Nile Virus Surveillance Data*. Available at: [insert URL if available], accessed [insert access date].

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: West Nile Virus Surveillance Data
   - **Description**: Contains 133,867 observations from 2008 to 2021, detailing the testing of mosquito traps for West Nile virus presence. After filtering, it includes 81,481 observations from 333 unique trap locations.
   - **Variables**: Includes trap latitude and longitude, sample collection day, number of mosquitoes in the sample, and test result (positive or negative).
   - **Citation**: Illinois Department of Public Health. *West Nile Virus Surveillance Data*. Available at: [insert URL if available], accessed [insert access date].

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details and citations accurately.
