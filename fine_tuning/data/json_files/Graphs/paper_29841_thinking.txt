To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton-based Action Recognition via Adaptive Cross-Form Learning" by Xuanhan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU-RGB+D 60**: This dataset contains 56,880 skeleton sequence samples across 60 action categories performed by 40 subjects. Each skeleton is represented by 25 joints with 3D coordinates captured from three different camera angles.

2. **NTU-RGB+D 120**: An extended version of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, it includes 114,480 skeleton sequence samples involving 120 action classes performed by 106 subjects across 155 viewpoints and three camera perspectives.

3. **UAV-Human**: This dataset consists of 22,476 multi-modal video sequences, covering 155 different activity categories performed by 119 subjects in various environments. It is specifically designed for human behavior understanding with unmanned aerial vehicles.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NTU-RGB+D 60** and **NTU-RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2019.

- For **UAV-Human**, the citation is:
  > Tianjiao Li, Jun Liu, Wei Zhang, Yun Ni, Wenqian Wang, and Zhiheng Li. *UAV-Human: A Large Benchmark for Human Behavior Understanding With Unmanned Aerial Vehicles*. In CVPR, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
