To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive AI Policy Education Framework for University Teaching and Learning" by Cecilia Ka Yuk Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that data was collected from **457 students and 180 teachers and staff** across various disciplines in Hong Kong universities. This suggests that there are specific datasets related to these groups.

Next, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets in the **methodology** section, where the author describes the data collection process. The methodology outlines that a survey design was utilized, and it specifies the number of participants (457 students and 180 teachers and staff). This information is crucial as it indicates the datasets used for analysis.

In the **results** section, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the findings from the datasets. The paper includes descriptive statistics for the survey data, which provides insights into the perceptions and usage of generative AI technologies among the participants. However, it does not provide specific dataset names or links.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide full citations for datasets, I will focus on the internal datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Student Survey Dataset**: This dataset includes responses from 457 undergraduate and postgraduate students regarding their usage and perceptions of generative AI technologies.

2. **Teacher and Staff Survey Dataset**: This dataset consists of responses from 180 teachers and staff members, capturing their views on the integration of AI technologies in higher education.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the datasets are derived from the author's own research, I will cite them as follows:

- For the **Student Survey Dataset**:
  > Chan, C. K. Y. (2023). *A Comprehensive AI Policy Education Framework for University Teaching and Learning*. Data collected from 457 undergraduate and postgraduate students in Hong Kong universities.

- For the **Teacher and Staff Survey Dataset**:
  > Chan, C. K. Y. (2023). *A Comprehensive AI Policy Education Framework for University Teaching and Learning*. Data collected from 180 teachers and staff members in Hong Kong universities.

Finally, I will ensure that these citations are clearly documented and ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis. This step-by-step approach ensures that I have thoroughly identified and cited the datasets relevant to the research paper.
