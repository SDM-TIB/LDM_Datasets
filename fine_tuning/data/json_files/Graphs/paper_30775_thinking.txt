To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Information Enhanced Multi-view Attributed Graph Clustering" by Jia-Qi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a clear description of each dataset, including the number of views, nodes, edges, and any specific attributes or features mentioned.

From the text, I note that the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset contains 3025 papers with two views (co-paper and co-author relationships) and is categorized into three clusters based on keywords.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4057 authors with three views (co-author, co-term, and co-conference relationships) and is categorized into four clusters.

3. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset includes 4780 movies with two views (co-actor and co-director relationships) and is categorized into three clusters.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the following citations:

- For the **ACM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Tang, J. Zhang, L. Yao, J. Li, L. Zhang, and Z. Su. *ArnetMiner: extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 990–998, 2008.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Pan, J. Wu, X. Zhu, C. Zhang, and Y. Wang. *Tri-Party deep network representation*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1895–1901, 2016.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Liu, P. Y. Chen, S. Yeung, T. Suzumura, and L. Chen. *Principled multilayer network embedding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, pages 134–141, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited for future reference.
