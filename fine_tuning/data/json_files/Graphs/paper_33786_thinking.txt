To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separating Common from Salient Patterns with Contrastive Representation Learning" by Robin Louiset et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on **three visual datasets and three medical datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention specific datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels. This dataset is often used for tasks related to facial recognition and attribute classification.

3. **CheXpert**: A large chest radiograph dataset containing 224,316 chest X-ray images labeled with the presence of 14 different pathologies. This dataset is used for medical image analysis.

4. **ODIR (Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition)**: A dataset containing images of fundus photographs for various ocular diseases, used for training models to recognize different eye conditions.

5. **Penn Action Dataset**: A dataset containing 2,326 video clips of human actions, annotated with joint locations for pose estimation tasks.

6. **sub-JHMDB Dataset**: A subset of the JHMDB dataset, which contains 316 video clips for action recognition, focusing on human pose estimation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CelebA**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

  > Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
