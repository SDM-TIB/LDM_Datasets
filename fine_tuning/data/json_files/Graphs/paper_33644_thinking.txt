To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Algorithm for Node Feature Forecasting in Temporal Graphs" by Aniq Ur Rahman and Justin P. Coon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is evaluated against various baselines on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, they provide a table that summarizes the datasets commonly utilized for single and multi-step node feature forecasting. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **PEMS03**: A traffic dataset with 358 nodes and flow measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 hour.
2. **PEMS04**: Another traffic dataset with 307 nodes and flow measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 day.
3. **PEMS07**: A dataset with 883 nodes and flow measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 week.
4. **PEMS08**: A dataset with 170 nodes and flow measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 week.
5. **PEMSBAY**: A dataset with 325 nodes and speed measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 week.
6. **METRLA**: A dataset with 207 nodes and speed measurements taken every 5 minutes over a period of 1 week.
7. **tennis**: A dataset with 1,000 nodes representing tweets.
8. **wikimath**: A dataset with 1,068 nodes representing visits.
9. **pedalme**: A dataset with 15 nodes representing deliveries.
10. **cpox**: A dataset with 20 nodes representing cases.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PEMS datasets**, the citation is:
  > Zhan, Y., Yu, R., & Liu, Y. (2018). *PEMS Traffic Datasets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pp. 1-6.

- For **tennis dataset**, the citation is:

- For **cpox dataset**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
