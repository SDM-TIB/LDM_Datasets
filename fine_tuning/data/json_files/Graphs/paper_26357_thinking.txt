To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PU-GCN: Point Cloud Upsampling using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Guocheng Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **PU1K**, which is a strong indication that this dataset will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they provide a detailed account of the **PU1K dataset**, including its size, composition, and how it was created. The authors mention that PU1K consists of 1,147 3D models, split into training and testing samples, and that it includes models from both their own collection and from **ShapeNetCore**.

In this section, I will note the following details about the **PU1K dataset**:
- It is nearly 8 times larger than the dataset used by PU-GAN.
- It includes 1,020 training samples and 127 testing samples.
- The training set contains models from both PU-GAN’s dataset and ShapeNetCore.
- The dataset covers a wide range of 3D object categories.

Next, I will look for the **ShapeNetCore dataset** mentioned in the paper. The authors state that they collected models from ShapeNetCore, which is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D modeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For **PU1K**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Guocheng Qian, Abdulellah Abualshour, Guohao Li, Ali Thabet, and Bernard Ghanem. *PU-GCN: Point Cloud Upsampling using Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

2. For **ShapeNetCore**, the citation is:
   > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references for future use or analysis.
