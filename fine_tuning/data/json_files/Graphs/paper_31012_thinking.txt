To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signed Directed Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure and Laplacian Augmentation" by Taewook Ko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on "four real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. The introduction may provide additional context or names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the datasets are likely described in section 5, where the authors discuss the datasets and metrics used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain key information.

In section 5.1, the authors list four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: This dataset is extracted from a Bitcoin trading platform, where nodes represent users and edges represent user relationships. Users can score others on a scale of -10 to +10, with edges higher than 0 treated as positive.

2. **Bitcoin-OTC**: Similar to Bitcoin-Alpha, this dataset is also from a Bitcoin trading platform and follows the same scoring system for user relationships.

3. **Epinions**: This dataset is a who-trust-whom network crawled from a consumer review site, where users can indicate trust or distrust towards other users.

4. **Slashdot**: This dataset represents a social network of a user community site where users can tag others as friends or foes, allowing for the construction of positive and negative edges.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. The citations may not be explicitly listed for the datasets, but I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

- For **Bitcoin-Alpha** and **Bitcoin-OTC**, the citation is:
  > Srijan Kumar, Francesca Spezzano, VS Subrahmanian, and Christos Faloutsos. *Edge weight prediction in weighted signed networks*. In 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 221–230, 2016.

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Ramanthan Guha, Ravi Kumar, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Andrew Tomkins. *Propagation of trust and distrust*. In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 403–412, 2004.

- For **Slashdot**, the citation is:
  > Jérôme Kunegis, Andreas Lommatzsch, and Christian Bauckhage. *The Slashdot Zoo: Mining a Social Network with Negative Edges*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, pages 741–750, 2009.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, ready for structured output or further analysis.
