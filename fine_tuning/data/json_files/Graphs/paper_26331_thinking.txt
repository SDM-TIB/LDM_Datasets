To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Deep Graph Neural Networks" by Claudio Gallicchio and Alessio Micheli, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors assess their model on several benchmark datasets for graph classification, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they consider **9 graph classification benchmarks** from cheminformatics and social network analysis. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

The authors provide a detailed description of each dataset in the **experiments section**. Here are the datasets mentioned:

1. **MUTAG**: A collection of nitroaromatic compounds used to predict their mutagenicity on Salmonella typhimurium.
   - Citation: Debnath, A. K., Lopez de Compadre, R. L., Debnath, G., Shusterman, A. J., & Hansch, C. (1991). Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 34(2), 786–797.

2. **PTC**: A dataset of chemical compounds classified as carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic for male rats.
   - Citation: Helma, C., King, R. D., Kramer, S., & Srinivasan, A. (2001). The predictive toxicology challenge 2000–2001. *Bioinformatics*, 17(1), 107–108.

3. **COX2**: Contains a set of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor molecules labeled as active or inactive.
   - Citation: Sutherland, J. J., O’Brien, L. A., & Weaver, D. F. (2003). Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structure-activity relationships. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*, 43(6), 1906–1915.

4. **PROTEINS**: A dataset of proteins classified as enzymes or non-enzymes.
   - Citation: Borgwardt, K. M., Ong, C. S., Schönauer, S., Vishwanathan, S., Smola, A. J., & Kriegel, H.-P. (2005). Protein function prediction via graph kernels. *Bioinformatics*, 21(suppl 1), i47–i56.

5. **NCI1**: Contains anti-cancer screens for cell lung cancer.
   - Citation: Wale, N., Watson, I. A., & Karypis, G. (2008). Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification. *Knowledge and Information Systems*, 14(3), 347–375.

6. **IMDB-BINARY**: Movie collaboration dataset containing actor/actress ego-networks with a target class representing the movie genre (2 classes: action or romance).
   - Citation: Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In *Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1365–1374).

7. **IMDB-MULTI**: Similar to IMDB-BINARY but with 3 classes (comedy, romance, and sci-fi).
   - Citation: Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In *Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1365–1374).

8. **REDDIT**: A collection of graphs corresponding to online discussion threads, classified into 2 classes (question/answer or discussion community).
   - Citation: Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In *Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1365–1374).

9. **COLLAB**: A set of scientific collaborations containing ego-networks of researchers classified based on the area of research (3 classes: high energy, condensed matter, or astrophysics).
   - Citation: Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In *Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1365–1374).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
