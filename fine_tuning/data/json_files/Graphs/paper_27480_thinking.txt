To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "InsertGNN: A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for the TOEFL Sentence Insertion Problem" by Fang Wu and Stan Z. Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a "newly collected TOEFL dataset" and the "larger arXiv dataset," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the construction of a dataset from TOEFL and mention its significance. They also refer to the arXiv dataset, which is used for cross-domain learning. This confirms that both datasets are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They mention:

1. **TOEFL Dataset**: This dataset consists of 156 samples collected from TOEFL exams, which are designed to test the English proficiency of non-native speakers. The authors note that the dataset has a relatively equal label distribution across different categories.

2. **arXiv Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from arXiv abstracts, containing 5,965 samples. The authors explain the criteria for selecting abstracts, ensuring they are informative and relevant to the TOEFL context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer the following based on the context:

- For the **TOEFL dataset**, since it is based on the TOEFL exam, I will reference the Educational Testing Service (ETS) as the source of the TOEFL exam materials. The citation could be:
  > Educational Testing Service. *TOEFL iBT Test and Score Data Summary*. Available at: https://www.ets.org/toefl/research.

- For the **arXiv dataset**, I will cite the arXiv preprint repository as the source of the abstracts. The citation could be:
  > arXiv. *arXiv: A repository of electronic preprints (known as e-prints) across multiple disciplines*. Available at: https://arxiv.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
