To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CopulaGNN: Towards Integrating Representational and Correlational Roles of Graphs in Graph Neural Networks" by Jiaqi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any statements that indicate the use of datasets for experiments or evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used in the study. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets used in the paper:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created a synthetic dataset to simulate the representational and correlational roles of graphs in node-level regression tasks. This dataset is generated based on specific statistical properties and is not publicly available.

2. **U.S. Election Dataset**: This dataset consists of demographic and election statistics for U.S. counties. The authors reference the work of Jia & Benson (2020) for more details on this dataset. The citation is:
   > Jia, J., & Benson, A. R. (2020). Residual correlation in graph neural network regression. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (pp. 588–598).

3. **Wikipedia Datasets**: The authors used two datasets from Wikipedia, specifically the Wiki-Chameleon and Wiki-Squirrel datasets, which are page-page networks of Wikipedia pages with visiting traffic as node labels. The citation for these datasets is:
   > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2019). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.13021.

4. **EMNLP Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from the DBLP citation data, focusing on papers published at the EMNLP conference. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). Arnetminer: Extraction and mining of academic social networks. In KDD’08 (pp. 990–998).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
