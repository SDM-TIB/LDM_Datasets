To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HADA: A Graph-based Amalgamation Framework in Image-text Retrieval" by Manh-Duy Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on the **Flickr30k dataset** and the **MSCOCO dataset**, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. Here, they describe the **Flickr30k dataset** as consisting of 31,000 images collected from the Flickr website, with each image having five relevant texts or captions. The **MSCOCO dataset** is mentioned as comprising 123,000 images, also with five relevant texts or captions per image. This section confirms that both datasets are indeed used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Flickr30k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2, 67-78.

- For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 740-755). Springer.

With this information gathered, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
