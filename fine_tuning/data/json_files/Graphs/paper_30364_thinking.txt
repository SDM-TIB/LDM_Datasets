To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Treewidth-aware Reductions of Normal ASP to SAT â€“ Is Normal ASP Harder than SAT after All?" by Markus Hecher, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are most likely to be described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail, including their creation, purpose, and any relevant metrics.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I will search for the datasets online using their names to find the original sources or publications that describe them. This may involve looking for datasets in repositories, academic journals, or conference proceedings.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
