To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeDyT: A General Framework for Multi-Step Event Forecasting via Sequence Modeling on Dynamic Entity Embeddings" by Hongkuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **five popular datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **GDELT**: A global database of events, locations, and tones from 1979 to 2012.
2. **ICEWS14**: A dataset containing coded event data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System for the year 2014.
3. **ICEWS18**: Similar to ICEWS14 but for the year 2018.
4. **WIKI**: A dataset derived from Wikipedia, used for event forecasting.
5. **YAGO**: A knowledge base derived from multilingual Wikipedia, which includes structured information.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure they are accurately described and confirm their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **GDELT**, the citation is:
  > Kalev Leetaru and Philip A Schrodt. *GDELT: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012*. In ISA annual convention, Vol. 2. Citeseer, 1–49, 2013.

- For **ICEWS14**, the citation is:
  > Elizabeth Boschee et al. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse 12, 2015.

- For **ICEWS18**, the citation is:
  > Elizabeth Boschee et al. *ICEWS coded event data*. Harvard Dataverse 12, 2015.

- For **WIKI**, the citation is:
  > Julien Leblay and Melisachew Wudage Chekol. *Deriving validity time in knowledge graph*. In Companion of the The Web Conference 2018 on The Web Conference 2018. International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee, 1771–1776, 2018.

- For **YAGO**, the citation is:
  > Farzaneh Mahdisoltani, Joanna Asia Biega, and Fabian M. Suchanek. *YAGO3: A Knowledge Base from Multilingual Wikipedias*. In CIDR, 2014.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
