To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Power Allocation in Multicarrier-Division Duplex Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems" by Bohan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the experimental setup, which can include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of the proposed methods or results. If the authors mention using simulation data or real-world datasets, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "Cell-Free Massive MIMO Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
