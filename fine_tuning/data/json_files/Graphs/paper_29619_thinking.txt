To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Robust Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yancheng Wang and Yingzhen Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experiments are conducted on "public and large-scale benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating BRGCL on five public benchmarks: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor CS, and ogbn-arxiv**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to the research.

I will then look for a **datasets section** or any subsection that provides detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this case, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Appendix A.1**, where they list the statistics of each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Nodes: 2,708
   - Edges: 5,429
   - Features: 1,433
   - Classes: 7

2. **Citeseer**: 
   - Nodes: 3,327
   - Edges: 4,732
   - Features: 3,703
   - Classes: 6

3. **Pubmed**: 
   - Nodes: 19,717
   - Edges: 44,338
   - Features: 500
   - Classes: 3

4. **Coauthor CS**: 
   - Nodes: 18,333
   - Edges: 81,894
   - Features: 6,805
   - Classes: 15

5. **ogbn-arxiv**: 
   - Nodes: 169,343
   - Edges: 1,166,243
   - Features: 128
   - Classes: 40

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *NeurIPS*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
