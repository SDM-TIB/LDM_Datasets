To extract datasets from the research paper titled "G-SemTMO: Tone Mapping with a Trainable Semantic Graph" by Abhishek Goswami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce **LocHDR**, a dataset of 781 HDR images that have been manually tone-mapped by an expert photo-retoucher. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of tone mapping operators and mention the **MIT Adobe FiveK dataset**. This dataset consists of 5000 RAW images and their retouched versions created by expert photographers, which is crucial for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsections detailing the datasets, I will find more specific information about how these datasets were used. The authors describe **LocHDR** in detail, noting that it consists of 781 HDR images that were enhanced manually, emphasizing the local tonal adjustments made by an expert. They also mention the **MIT Adobe FiveK dataset** again, highlighting its use in training their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **LocHDR Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is introduced in their work. However, I will note that it is a new dataset created as part of this research.

2. **MIT Adobe FiveK Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > V. Bychkovsky, S. Paris, E. Chan, and F. Durand. *Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input/output image pairs*. In CVPR 2011. IEEE, 2011, pp. 97â€“104.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **LocHDR**: A dataset of 781 HDR images tone-mapped manually by an expert photo-retoucher, focusing on local tonal enhancements.
- **MIT Adobe FiveK**: A dataset containing 5000 RAW images and their retouched versions created by 5 expert photographers, used for training and evaluation.

Finally, I will compile these findings into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
