To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepGD: A Deep Learning Framework for Graph Drawing Using GNN" by Xiaoqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a framework for graph drawing, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of graph drawing and the need for effective datasets but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they describe the training data.

In **section 4.1 (Training Data and Preprocessing)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Rome graphs dataset**. They describe it as a benchmark dataset containing 11,534 undirected graphs with varying structures, which is crucial for training their model. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Rome graphs dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it refers to a website where the dataset can be found. I will note that the dataset is available at:
> http://www.graphdrawing.org/data.html

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the Rome dataset, I will include the URL as part of the dataset entry.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **Rome Graphs Dataset**: A widely used benchmark dataset containing 11,534 undirected graphs, each consisting of 10 to 100 nodes with diverse structures. This dataset is essential for training the DeepGD model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary citation information, even if it is just a URL.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
