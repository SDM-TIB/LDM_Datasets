To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Hierarchical Review Graph Representations for Recommendation" by Yong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of users, items, and ratings density.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a **Table 1** that summarizes the statistics of the experimental datasets. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset includes various categories such as "Musical Instruments," "Office Products," "Toys and Games," "Beauty," and "Video Games." Each category has specific statistics regarding the number of users, items, and ratings density.

2. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned, specifically noting that it was filtered to include only users and items with at least 10 reviews.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
> He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In *Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web* (WWW), 507-517.

For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yelp Dataset. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
