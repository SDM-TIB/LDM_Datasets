To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Saturation Restoration for LDR Images of HDR Scenes" by Chaobing Zheng, Zhengguo Li, and Shiqian Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their dataset. Here, they mention that they built a dataset comprising **420 sets of differently exposed images**, each containing three images captured with a Nikon 7200 camera. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the camera settings and how the images were captured.

I will note the following details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Differently Exposed Images Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 420 sets of images, each set containing three differently exposed images captured using a Nikon 7200 camera with an ISO setting of 800. The exposure times vary, and the dataset is split into 340 images for training and 80 for testing.
- **Usage**: This dataset is used to evaluate the proposed saturation restoration algorithm.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be original and not cited from another source, so I will create a citation for it based on the authors and the title of the paper.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Chaobing Zheng, Zhengguo Li, and Shiqian Wu. *Hybrid Saturation Restoration for LDR Images of HDR Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset extracted from the paper.
