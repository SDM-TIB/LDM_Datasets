To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fault Location in Power Distribution Systems via Deep Graph Convolutional Networks" by Kunjin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the effectiveness of the proposed GCN model is validated using the **IEEE 123 bus benchmark system**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **Section II (Fault Location Based on Graph Convolutional Networks)**, particularly the subsection that describes the test case. Here, the authors introduce the **IEEE 123 bus distribution system test case** and provide details about how the dataset was generated, including the types of faults simulated and the number of data samples created.

In **Section II.D**, the authors explain that they generated a total of **13,520 data samples** for both training and testing, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's size and structure. They also mention that faults were simulated for all buses in the system, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **results** sections. However, the primary dataset appears to be the **IEEE 123 bus distribution system**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 123 bus system. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to format it correctly.

The citation for the IEEE 123 bus system is:
> W. H. Kersting, "Radial distribution test feeders," in Proc. IEEE Power Engineering Society Winter Meeting, vol. 2, 2001, pp. 908â€“912.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics, along with the full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
