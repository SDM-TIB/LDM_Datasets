To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Contrastive Learning of Multi-view Facial Expressions" by Shuvendu Roy and Ali Etemad, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on two multi-view facial expression recognition datasets, specifically naming **KDEF** and **DDCF**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, they provide descriptions of both datasets:

1. **KDEF (Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces)**: This dataset consists of images of 140 subjects displaying 7 different expressions from 5 different angles. This multi-view dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **DDCF (Dartmouth Database of Children’s Faces)**: This dataset includes images from 80 subjects, each showing 8 different expressions from 5 different angles. It is also a multi-view dataset, which aligns with the focus of the research.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **KDEF**, the citation is:
  > Lundqvist, D., Flykt, A., & Öhman, A. (1998). *The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF)*. CD ROM from Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Psychology Section, Karolinska Institutet.

- For **DDCF**, the citation is:
  > Dalrymple, K. A., Gomez, J., & Duchaine, B. (2013). *The Dartmouth Database of Children’s Faces: Acquisition and validation of a new face stimulus set*. PloS One, 8(11), e79131.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
