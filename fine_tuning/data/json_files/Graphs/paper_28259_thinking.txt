To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Based Network with Contextualized Representations of Turns in Dialogue" by Bongseok Lee and Yong Suk Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a dialogue-based relation extraction dataset and three emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) datasets. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dialogue Based Relation Extraction)**, where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **DialogRE dataset**. The paper states that DialogRE is a human-annotated dialogue-based relation extraction dataset with 36 relation types, 1,788 dialogues, and 8,119 triples. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used for their experiments.

Then, I will examine **section 4.2 (Emotion Recognition in Conversations)**, where the authors discuss three ERC benchmark datasets:

1. **MELD**: A multimodal dataset collected from the TV show "Friends," containing 2,458 dialogues and 12,708 utterances, each annotated with one of seven emotion labels.

2. **EmoryNLP**: Another dataset from "Friends," consisting of 897 dialogues and 12,606 utterances, also annotated with seven emotion labels.

3. **DailyDialog**: A dataset reflecting daily communication, containing 13,118 dialogues and 102,979 utterances, with each utterance annotated with one of seven emotion labels.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
