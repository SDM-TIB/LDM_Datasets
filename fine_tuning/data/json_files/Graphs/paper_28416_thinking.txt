To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Avoiding Forgetting and Allowing Forward Transfer in Continual Learning via Sparse Networks" by Ghada Sokar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention several benchmarks and datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for classification tasks containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This dataset is used to construct the split-CIFAR10 benchmark.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images. This dataset is used to create the sim-CIFAR100 benchmark.

3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, used in the Mix datasets benchmark.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of clothing items, structured similarly to MNIST, used in the Mix datasets benchmark.

5. **NotMNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST, containing images of letters from different fonts, also used in the Mix datasets benchmark.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer (2009).

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer (2009).

- **MNIST**: 
  > LeCun, Y. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).

- **Fashion-MNIST**: 
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., Vollgraf, R. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

- **NotMNIST**: 
  > Bulatov, Y. *NotMNIST dataset*. Technical report (2011), http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.it/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
