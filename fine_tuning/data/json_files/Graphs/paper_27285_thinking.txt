To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond the Signs: Nonparametric Tensor Completion via Sign Series" by Chanwoo Lee and Miaoyan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their approach on "two datasets, one on human brain connectivity networks and the other on topic data mining." This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will check the **methods** or **experiments** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, I will look for a section that discusses the datasets in detail, likely under a heading such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection."

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MRN-114 Human Brain Connectivity Dataset**: This dataset records the structural connectivity among 68 brain regions for 114 individuals along with their IQ scores. The authors organize this data into an order-3 tensor representing the presence or absence of fiber connections between brain regions across individuals.

2. **NIPS Word Occurrence Dataset**: This dataset consists of word occurrence counts in papers published from 1987 to 2003. The authors focus on the top 100 authors and 200 most frequent words, normalizing each word count by log transformation with a pseudo-count of 1.

Next, I will locate the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MRN-114 Human Brain Connectivity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, L., Durante, D., Jung, R. E., & Dunson, D. B. (2017). Bayesian network–response regression. *Bioinformatics*, 33(12), 1859–1866.

- For the **NIPS Word Occurrence Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Globerson, A., Chechik, G., Pereira, F., & Tishby, N. (2007). Euclidean embedding of co-occurrence data. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 8, 2265–2295.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
