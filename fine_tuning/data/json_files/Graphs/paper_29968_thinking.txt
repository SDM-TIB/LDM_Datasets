To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer-reﬁned Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommendation" by Xin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on "four public datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their characteristics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize dataset statistics, as these often contain valuable information.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe four datasets:
1. **MOOC**: This dataset records the enrollment courses of users from October 1st, 2016 to March 31st, 2018. It is noted for its typical recommendation pattern in a start-up platform.
2. **Amazon Video Games (Games)**: A subset of the Amazon review dataset from 2018, which records user-item interactions based on ratings.
3. **Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food (Food)**: Similar to the Video Games dataset but focused on food items, with a larger interaction graph.
4. **Yelp**: A check-in dataset for business recommendations, using the latest version available from Yelp.com.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MOOC** dataset:
  > J. Zhang, B. Hao, B. Chen, C. Li, H. Chen, and J. Sun. *Hierarchical reinforcement learning for course recommendation in moocs*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 33, no. 01, 2019, pp. 435–442.

- For **Amazon Video Games** and **Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food** datasets:
  > J. Ni, J. Li, and J. McAuley. *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 2019, pp. 188–197.

  > P. Lops, M. d. Gemmis, and G. Semeraro. *Content-based recommender systems: State of the art and trends*. Recommender systems handbook, pp. 73–105, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
