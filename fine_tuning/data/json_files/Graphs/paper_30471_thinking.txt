To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latency Aware Semi-synchronous Client Selection and Model Aggregation for Wireless Federated Learning" by Liangkun Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the federated learning framework, it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Simulation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their machine learning models. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is used for image classification and contains 60,000 images across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their details are explicitly stated in the simulation setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
