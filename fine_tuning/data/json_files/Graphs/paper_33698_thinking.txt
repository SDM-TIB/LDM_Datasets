To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully autonomous tuning of a spin qubit" by Miguel J. Carballido et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that describe experimental setups or data collection processes. This section is crucial as it often details the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss any datasets in the context of their findings. This section may provide additional insights into how the datasets were utilized and any specific metrics or outcomes associated with them.

I will also review the **discussion and conclusion sections** to see if the authors reflect on the datasets used, their implications, or any future datasets they plan to explore. This can help in understanding the broader context of the datasets within the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. It is essential to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets related to the tuning of semiconductor qubits, as the title suggests a focus on quantum computing and qubit operation. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named, such as those used for training machine learning models or for experimental validation.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly, and that the full citation is included for each one. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, along with their proper citations.
