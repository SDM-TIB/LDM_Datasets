To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReVoLT: Relational Reasoning and Voronoi Local Graph Planning for Target-driven Navigation" by Junjia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a hierarchical framework for target-driven navigation, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention the **Matterport3D dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They note that this dataset contains 90 houses with 40 categories of objects and 31 labels of regions, which is crucial information for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related works** section (Section II) or throughout the paper. The authors reference the **AI2-THOR dataset** in the context of previous works, indicating its relevance to the field but not necessarily as a dataset used in their own experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Matterport3D Dataset**:
   > Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, A., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. In International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV).

2. **AI2-THOR Dataset**:
   > Kolve, E., Mottaghi, R., Han, W., VanderBilt, E., Weihs, L., Herrasti, A., Gordon, D., Zhu, Y., Gupta, A., & Farhadi, A. (2017). *AI2-THOR: An interactive 3D environment for visual AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05474.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
