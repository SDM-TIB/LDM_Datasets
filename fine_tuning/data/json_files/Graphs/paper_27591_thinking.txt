To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations" by Xiao Wang and Guo-Jun Qi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **ImageNet dataset** and several downstream datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors discuss their experiments on various datasets, including:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is referenced multiple times as the primary dataset used for training and evaluation. It is a well-known large-scale dataset for image classification tasks.

2. **VOC07**: The authors mention achieving a top-1 accuracy of 93.6% on the VOC07 dataset, which is commonly used for object detection and classification tasks.

3. **COCO**: The paper discusses improvements in object detection performance on the COCO dataset, which is another widely used dataset for object detection tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **VOC07**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective." International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98–136, 2015.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. H. G. Dollár, R. Girshick, K. He, B. Hariharan, and S. R. M. A. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
