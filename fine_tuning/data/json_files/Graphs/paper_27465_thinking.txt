To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Document Embedding via Contrastive Augmentation" by Dongsheng Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method with a broad range of baseline methods on **six benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors provide a list of datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **R8**: A subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, consisting of 7,674 documents across 8 categories.
2. **R52**: Another subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, containing 9,100 documents across 52 categories.
3. **MR**: A movie review dataset for sentiment analysis, with 10,062 documents (5,331 positive and 5,331 negative).
4. **Ohsumed**: A medical literature dataset with 7,400 documents from 23 categories.
5. **20news**: A dataset containing 18,846 documents across 20 different classes.
6. **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment analysis, consisting of 100,000 movie reviews, with 50,000 labeled.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **R8 and R52**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
