To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Stacking Framework for Training Deep Graph Models with Multifaceted Node Features" by Jiuhai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for benchmarking their proposed method. Specifically, I will look for sections that describe the datasets, including their characteristics and the tasks they are used for.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **House Dataset**: This dataset consists of nodes representing properties, with edges connecting neighboring properties. The task is to predict the price of each house.

2. **County Dataset**: In this dataset, each node represents a county, and edges connect counties that share a border. The goal is to predict the unemployment rate for each county.

3. **VK Dataset**: This dataset consists of nodes representing individuals, with edges representing friendships between them. The task is to predict the age of each person.

4. **Avazu Dataset**: Here, each node represents a device, and edges connect devices that appear on the same site with the same application. The target is to predict the click-through rate of each device.

5. **OGB-Arxiv Dataset**: This is a standard dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) used for node classification tasks, where nodes have raw text features.

6. **OGB-Products Dataset**: Another dataset from the OGB, used for node classification tasks, where nodes also have raw text features.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **House Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
