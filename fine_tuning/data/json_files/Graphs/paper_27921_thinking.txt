To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ROPE: Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding for Graph-based Document Information Extraction" by Chen-Yu Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks on the **FUNSD dataset** and a **large-scale payment dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Payment Dataset**: The authors describe a large-scale payment document collection consisting of around 18,000 single-page payments from various vendors. They mention that the dataset is annotated with 13 semantic entities and includes over 3 million word-level annotations. They also specify that the dataset is split into training and test sets in an 80-20 ratio.

2. **FUNSD Dataset**: The FUNSD dataset is described as a public dataset for form understanding in noisy scanned documents, containing 199 annotated forms with 9,707 entities and 31,485 word-level annotations for four entity types: header, question, answer, and other. The authors note that they use the official 75-25 split for training and test sets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **FUNSD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guillaume Jaume, Hazim Kemal Ekenel, and Jean-Philippe Thiran. *FUNSD: A Dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents*. In ICDAR-OST, 2019.

- For the **Payment dataset**, since it is based on the work of Majumder et al. (2020), I will use the citation for that paper:
  > Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Navneet Potti, Sandeep Tata, James Bradley Wendt, Qi Zhao, and Marc Najork. *Representation Learning for Information Extraction from Form-like Documents*. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
