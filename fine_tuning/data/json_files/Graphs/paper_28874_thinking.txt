To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of the electron density of states for crystalline compounds with Atomistic Line Graph Neural Networks (ALIGNN)" by Prathik R. Kaundinya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on the **JARVIS-DFT dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **application sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting the electron density of states (DOS) and mention the use of the JARVIS-DFT dataset for training their model. This suggests that the dataset is crucial for their research.

In the **application section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, stating that it comprises approximately **56,000 crystalline materials** and their corresponding DOS spectra. They also mention that the dataset includes structural information and DFT-computed chemical properties, which further confirms its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the JARVIS-DFT dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> K. Choudhary, B. DeCost, and F. Tavazza. *npj Computational Materials*, 7, 185 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00650-1.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **JARVIS-DFT Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 56,000 crystalline materials and their corresponding electron density of states (DOS) spectra, along with structural information and DFT-computed chemical properties.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This process will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
