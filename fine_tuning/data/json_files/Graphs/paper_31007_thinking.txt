To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering disease trajectories in contrastive feature space for biomarker discovery in age-related macular degeneration" by Robbie Holland et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used. In this case, it states that the method was tested on "two large longitudinal retinal OCT datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically **section 3.1**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention:

1. **Development dataset**: This is an in-house retinal OCT dataset collected from the Southampton Eye Unit, consisting of 46,496 scans from 6,236 eyes of 3,456 patients. The dataset captures longitudinal data over an average of 1.9 years.

2. **Unseen dataset**: This dataset is independent and collected from Moorfields Eye Hospital, containing 114,062 scans from 7,253 eyes of 3,819 patients, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study, as they provide the necessary longitudinal imaging data to evaluate the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are in-house and not published in separate papers, they may not have formal citations. Instead, I will note that they are described in the paper itself.

For the **Development dataset**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Development dataset**: Holland, R., et al. "Clustering disease trajectories in contrastive feature space for biomarker discovery in age-related macular degeneration." In-house dataset, Southampton Eye Unit.

For the **Unseen dataset**, I will summarize it similarly:
- **Unseen dataset**: Holland, R., et al. "Clustering disease trajectories in contrastive feature space for biomarker discovery in age-related macular degeneration." In-house dataset, Moorfields Eye Hospital.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the context and details necessary for understanding their significance in the research, while also providing the appropriate citations as described above.
