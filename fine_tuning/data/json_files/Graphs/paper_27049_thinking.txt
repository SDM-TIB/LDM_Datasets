To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KShapeNet: Riemannian network on Kendall shape space for Skeleton based Action Recognition" by Racha Friji et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two large-scale skeleton datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for validation. Here, they state that they conducted experiments on two datasets: **NTU-RGB+D** and **NTU-RGB+D120**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of samples.

1. **NTU-RGB+D**: This dataset is described as one of the largest 3D human action recognition datasets, consisting of 56,000 action clips across 60 classes. It includes data from 40 participants performing actions in a controlled environment with three camera views. The Kinect sensors capture the 3D coordinates of 25 joints.

2. **NTU-RGB+D120**: This dataset is an extension of NTU-RGB+D, containing 114,480 skeleton sequences across 120 action classes performed by 106 distinct subjects. The authors mention that it is the largest RGB+D dataset for 3D action recognition.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **NTU-RGB+D**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2016, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU-RGB+D120**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 42(10):2684–2701, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
