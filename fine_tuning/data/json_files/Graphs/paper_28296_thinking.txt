To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Path-based Fake News Detection Leveraging Multi-level Social Context Information" by Jian Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using "two real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two datasets: **FANG** and **FakeHealth**. I will extract the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **dataset and settings subsection (5.1)**, the authors provide descriptions of both datasets:

1. **FANG Dataset**: This dataset is composed of checked news from political fact-checking websites, specifically Snopes and PolitiFact. It includes 1,054 news articles, with 448 labeled as fake and 606 as real. The dataset also contains information about user engagement on Twitter.

2. **FakeHealth Dataset**: This dataset focuses on the healthcare domain and consists of two subsets, but the authors specifically mention using the **HealthStory** subset due to its larger size. The dataset includes news articles rated by professional reviewers, with scores determining whether an article is considered fake or real.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **FANG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Van-Hoang Nguyen, Kazunari Sugiyama, Preslav Nakov, and Min-Yen Kan. *FANG: Leveraging social context for fake news detection using graph representation*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, pages 1165–1174, 2020.

- For the **FakeHealth dataset**, the citation is:
  > Enyan Dai, Yiwei Sun, and Suhang Wang. *Ginger cannot cure cancer: Battling fake health news with a comprehensive data repository*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, Vol. 14, pages 853–862, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for any required structured output or further processing.
