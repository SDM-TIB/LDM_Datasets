To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre-trained Language Models via Contrastive Learning" by Yujia Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various language understanding tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **DocRED**: This dataset is described as a large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset. It is referenced multiple times throughout the experiments, indicating its significance in the study.

2. **FIGER**: This dataset is used for entity typing and is mentioned in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

3. **WikiHop**: This dataset is utilized for multi-choice question answering and is also referenced in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2019, Florence, Italy, July 28- August 2, 2019.

- For **FIGER**, the citation is:
  > Lingpeng Kong, Cyprien de Masson d’Autume, Lei Yu, Wang Ling, Zihang Dai, and Dani Yogatama. *A mutual information maximization perspective of language representation learning*. In Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020, Virtual Conference, April 26, 2020.

- For **WikiHop**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Welbl, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Constructing datasets for multi-hop reading comprehension across documents*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6:287–302, 2018.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
