To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning Using Beta Divergence for Face Understanding" by Mehmet Can Yavuz and Berrin Yanikoglu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is validated using datasets in the face understanding domain, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Method and Experimental Evaluation sections**. In these sections, the authors mention using two datasets: **CelebA** and **YFCC-CelebA**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant information about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **Experimental Evaluation section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including the number of classes and the number of training, validation, and test samples. Specifically, they mention:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: A well-known public dataset for face attribute recognition, containing 162,770 training images and 19,867 validation images, with 40 attribute classes.

2. **YFCC-CelebA Dataset**: A subset of the web-collected YFCC dataset, containing 392,220 images, which is weakly labeled and noisy. It has 59 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **YFCC-CelebA Dataset**:
  > Mehmet Can Yavuz, Sara Atito Ali Ahmed, Mehmet Efe Kısaağa, Hasan Ocak, and Berrin Yanıkoglu. *YFCC-CelebA Face Attributes Datasets*. In 2021 29th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), pages 1–4, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
