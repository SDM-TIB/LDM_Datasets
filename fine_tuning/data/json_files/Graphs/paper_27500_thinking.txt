To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bipartite Graph Network with Adaptive Message Passing for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation" by Rongjie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves competitive performance on several challenging datasets, specifically mentioning **Visual Genome** and **Open Images V4/V6**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors highlight their validation on three scene graph generation datasets, which confirms the presence of datasets that need to be documented.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the following datasets:

1. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is referenced as a key benchmark for scene graph generation. It is known for its dense annotations and is widely used in visual understanding tasks.

2. **Open Images V4**: This dataset is noted for its large-scale image annotations and is used for various vision tasks, including scene graph generation.

3. **Open Images V6**: This is an updated version of the Open Images dataset, which includes more images and annotations, further enhancing its utility for scene graph generation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

- For **Open Images V4**, the citation is:
  > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection at scale*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2020.

- For **Open Images V6**, the citation is:
  > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The Open Images Dataset V6: Unified image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection at scale*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Visual Genome**: A dataset for visual understanding with dense annotations connecting language and vision.
2. **Open Images V4**: A large-scale dataset for image classification and object detection with visual relationship annotations.
3. **Open Images V6**: An updated version of Open Images with enhanced annotations and a larger image set.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
