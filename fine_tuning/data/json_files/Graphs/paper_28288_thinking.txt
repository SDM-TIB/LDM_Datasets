To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Bregman Divergence for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations" by Mina Rezaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple classification and object detection tasks and datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify which datasets are used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images, categorized into 10 classes. The images are of size 32x32 pixels.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but it contains 100 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images, also of size 32x32 pixels.
3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes 5,000 training images and 8,000 test images in 10 classes, with images sized at 96x96 pixels. It also contains 100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning tasks.
4. **ImageNet**: Known as ILSVRC 2012, this dataset contains 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes.
5. **ISIC-2018**: This dataset is part of a challenge on skin cancer detection, consisting of 10,015 dermatology scans of size 128x128 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Citeseer, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **ISIC-2018**, the citation is:
  > Noel Codella, Veronica Rotemberg, Philipp Tschandl, M Emre Celebi, Stephen Dusza, David Gutman, Brian Helba, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Michael Marchetti, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (isic)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
