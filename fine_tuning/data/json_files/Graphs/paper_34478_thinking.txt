To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CaseGNN++: Graph Contrastive Learning for Legal Case Retrieval with Graph Augmentation" by Yanran Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **COLIEE 2022** and **COLIEE 2023**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their purpose, size, and any unique characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets. Here, I will note the following details:

1. **COLIEE 2022**: 
   - Train set: 898 queries, 4415 candidates, average of 4.68 relevant cases, average length of 6724 tokens.
   - Test set: 300 queries, 1563 candidates, average of 4.21 relevant cases, average length of 6785 tokens.

2. **COLIEE 2023**: 
   - Train set: 959 queries, 4400 candidates, average of 4.68 relevant cases, average length of 6532 tokens.
   - Test set: 319 queries, 1335 candidates, average of 2.69 relevant cases, average length of 5566 tokens.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as part of the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE) for both years. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **COLIEE 2022**:
  > Randy Goebel, Yoshinobu Kano, Mi-Young Kim, Maria Navas Loro, Nguyen Le Minh, Juliano Rabelo, Julien Rossi, Ken Satoh, Jaromir Savelka, Yunqiu Shao, Akira Shimazu, Satoshi Tojo, Vu Tran, Josef Valvoda, Hannes Westermann, Hiroaki Yamada, Masaharu Yoshioka, and Sabine Wehnert. *Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE)*, 2022.

- For **COLIEE 2023**:
  > Randy Goebel, Yoshinobu Kano, Mi-Young Kim, Maria Navas Loro, Nguyen Le Minh, Juliano Rabelo, Julien Rossi, Ken Satoh, Jaromir Savelka, Yunqiu Shao, Akira Shimazu, Satoshi Tojo, Vu Tran, Josef Valvoda, Hannes Westermann, Hiroaki Yamada, Masaharu Yoshioka, and Sabine Wehnert. *Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE)*, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
