To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Articulated Rigid Body Dynamics with Lagrangian Graph Neural Network" by Ravinder Bhattoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **n-link systems** (where n = 4, 8, 16) for their experiments. This indicates that they have generated datasets based on these systems.

I will also look for any specific details about the datasets in the **appendices**, particularly in **Appendix A.1 (Experimental systems)** and **Appendix A.4 (Dataset generation)**. Here, the authors describe how they generated the datasets using known Lagrangian mechanics and constraints. They mention that they created training data by performing forward simulations and collected data points at specific time intervals.

The datasets mentioned include:
1. **4-link system dataset**: This dataset is generated from simulations of a 4-link articulated rigid body system. The authors specify that they collected 10,000 data points from 100 trajectories, which were used for training the model.

2. **8-link and 16-link systems**: These datasets are used to evaluate the generalizability of the model trained on the 4-link system. The authors indicate that they tested the model on these unseen systems to assess its performance.

3. **Complex systems (tensegrity structures)**: The authors also mention evaluating the model on complex structures made of chains and rods, which are described in the experimental systems section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets:

- For the **4-link system dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhattoo, R., Ranu, S., & Krishnan, N. M. A. (2022). Learning Articulated Rigid Body Dynamics with Lagrangian Graph Neural Network. In Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).

- For the **8-link and 16-link systems**, the citation remains the same as they are derived from the same research.

- For the **complex systems (tensegrity structures)**, the citation is also:
  > Bhattoo, R., Ranu, S., & Krishnan, N. M. A. (2022). Learning Articulated Rigid Body Dynamics with Lagrangian Graph Neural Network. In Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its citation for future reference or processing.
