To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimGRACE: A Simple Framework for Graph Contrastive Learning without Data Augmentation" by Jun Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly listed. In section 4.1.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **NCI1**: A dataset of biochemical molecules.
2. **PROTEINS**: Another dataset of biochemical molecules.
3. **DD**: A dataset of biochemical molecules.
4. **MUTAG**: A dataset of biochemical molecules.
5. **COLLAB**: A dataset of social networks.
6. **RDT-B**: A dataset of social networks.
7. **RDT-M5K**: A dataset of social networks.
8. **IMDB-B**: A dataset of social networks.

In section 4.1.2, the authors also mention datasets used for transfer learning, including:

1. **ZINC-2M**: A dataset of biochemical molecules used for pre-training.
2. **PPI-306K**: A dataset of protein-protein interaction networks used for pre-training.
3. **BBBP**: A dataset of biochemical molecules used for fine-tuning.
4. **ToxCast**: A dataset of biochemical molecules used for fine-tuning.
5. **SIDER**: A dataset of biochemical molecules used for fine-tuning.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, I will look for citations related to the following datasets:

- **NCI1**: The citation may refer to the original source of the dataset, which is often a journal article or a conference paper.
- **PROTEINS**: Similarly, I will find the citation that describes this dataset.
- **ZINC-2M**: I will look for the citation that provides details about this dataset as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for downstream processing or review.
