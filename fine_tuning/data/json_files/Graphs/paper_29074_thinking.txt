To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Intermediate Representations using Graph Neural Networks for NUMA and Prefetchers Optimization" by Ali TehraniJamsaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a comprehensive dataset that includes various intermediate representations and optimum configurations, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **Section III (Approach)**, where the authors describe how they create the dataset. They mention using various compiler optimization flags to produce different forms of the same program, which implies that the dataset consists of these different intermediate representations.

In **Section IV (Experimental Results)**, the authors refer to using specific benchmarks for their experiments. They mention using the **Rodinia benchmark suite** and the **NAS Parallel Benchmarks**. This is crucial as it indicates that these benchmarks are part of the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **Rodinia Benchmark Suite**: The citation is:
   > S. Che, M. Boyer, J. Meng, D. Tarjan, J. W. Sheaffer, S.-H. Lee, and K. Skadron. *Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization, pages 44–54, 2009.

2. **NAS Parallel Benchmarks**: The citation is:
   > D. H. Bailey, E. Barszcz, J. T. Barton, D. S. Browning, R. L. Carter, L. Dagum, R. A. Fatoohi, P. O. Frederickson, T. A. Lasinski, R. S. Schreiber, H. D. Simon, V. Venkatakrishnan, and S. K. Weeratunga. *The NAS Parallel Benchmarks — Summary and Preliminary Results*. In Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, pages 158–165, 1991.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
