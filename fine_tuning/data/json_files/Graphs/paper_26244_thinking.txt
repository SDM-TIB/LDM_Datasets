To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperLearn: A Distributed Approach for Representation Learning in Datasets With Many Modalities" by Devanshu Arya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges of learning representations in multimodal datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is used for a matrix completion task and consists of 100,000 ratings from 943 users for 1,682 movies. The authors refer to the MovieLens 100K dataset specifically.

2. **MIR Flickr Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for social image understanding and consists of 25,000 images from Flickr, posted by 6,386 users, with over 50,000 user-provided tags. The authors mention filtering this dataset to 15,662 images for their experiments.

3. **OmniArt Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale artistic benchmark collection containing millions of artworks along with extensive metadata. The authors specifically mention using a sub-sample of 10,000 artworks for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Miller, B. N., Albert, I., Lam, S. K., Konstan, J. A., & Riedl, J. (2003). *MovieLens unplugged: experiences with an occasionally connected recommender system*. In Proceedings of the 8th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces (pp. 263-266). ACM.

- For the **MIR Flickr Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huiskes, M. J., & Lew, M. S. (2008). *The MIR flickr retrieval evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia information retrieval (pp. 39-43). ACM.

- For the **OmniArt Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Strezoski, G., & Worring, M. (2018). *OmniArt: A Large-scale Artistic Benchmark*. ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM), 14(4), 88.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
