To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise Conscious Training of Non Local Neural Network powered by Self Attentive Spectral Normalized Markovian Patch GAN for Low Dose CT Denoising" by Sutanu Bera and Prabir Kumar Biswas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was validated on a publicly available dataset from the 2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental settings section**. Here, the authors state that they used a publicly available Low Dose CT image database by Mayo Clinic, which contains simulated quarter dose CT scans of 10 patients. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of patients and slices per scan.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as the "2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge," which is a specific challenge dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains simulated quarter dose CT scans of 10 patients, with approximately 250 slices per scan. It is publicly available and was used to validate the proposed method.

Next, I will look for the full citation for this dataset in the references. Since the dataset is associated with a challenge, it may not have a traditional citation format, but I will note the challenge name and the year it was conducted.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as accurately as possible. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who wishes to access the dataset for their own research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
