To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FSCE: Few-Shot Object Detection via Contrastive Proposal Encoding" by Bo Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **PASCAL VOC** and **COCO** benchmarks for their experiments. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they report results on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, specifically mentioning the number of categories and the nature of the splits used for evaluation. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PASCAL VOC** dataset, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For the **COCO** dataset, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
