To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Soft Contrastive Learning" by Chen Feng and Ioannis Patras, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in self-supervised learning and mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. This suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes.
3. **STL10**: Contains 100,000 unlabeled images, 5,000 labeled training images, and 8,000 test images, with a resolution of 96x96 pixels and 10 classes.
4. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 100,000 training images and 10,000 validation images, resized to 64x64 pixels and containing 200 classes.
5. **ImageNet-1k**: A large dataset with approximately 1.3 million training images and 50,000 validation images, also known as the ILSVRC-2012 dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**:
  > A subset of the ImageNet dataset, details can be found at the official website: http://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

- For **ImageNet-1k**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
