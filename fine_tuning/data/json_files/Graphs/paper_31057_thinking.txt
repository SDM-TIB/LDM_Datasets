To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Font Generation by Learning Style Difference and Similarity" by Xiao He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is trained on a dataset from FTransGAN, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that the model is trained on a dataset proposed by FTransGAN, which includes 847 gray-scale fonts, each with approximately 1000 commonly used Chinese characters and 52 Latin letters. This is a clear indication of the dataset's content and structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset from FTransGAN, which is cited as follows:

- For the FTransGAN dataset, the citation is:
  > Chenhao Li, Yuta Taniguchi, Min Lu, and Shin’ichi Konomi. *Few-shot font style transfer between different languages*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 433–442, 2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **FTransGAN Dataset**: This dataset includes 847 gray-scale fonts, each containing approximately 1000 commonly used Chinese characters and 52 Latin letters. It is used for training the proposed model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured for future reference or processing.
