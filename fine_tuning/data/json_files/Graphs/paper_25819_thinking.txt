To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Ruoyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **nine graph-structured datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **Delaney Dataset**: This dataset contains aqueous solubility data for 1,144 low molecular weight compounds. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Delaney, J. S. (2004). Esol: estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*, 44(3), 1000–1005.

2. **NCI Database**: This database includes around 20,000 compounds and 60 prediction tasks related to drug reaction experiments. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in the field.

3. **Az-logD Dataset**: This dataset offers logD measurements on permeability for 4,200 compounds. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Vugmeyster, Y., Harrold, J., & Xu, X. (2012). Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of biotherapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. *The AAPS Journal*, 14(4), 714–727.

4. **Tox21 Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,950 chemical compounds and labels for classifications on 12 essays of toxicity. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mayr, A., Klambauer, G., Unterthiner, T., & Hochreiter, S. (2016). Deeptox: toxicity prediction using deep learning. *Frontiers in Environmental Science*, 3, 80.

5. **ClinTox Dataset**: This public dataset includes 1,451 chemical compounds for clinical toxicological study with labels for 2 tasks. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided, so I will note that it is a commonly referenced dataset.

6. **Sider Database**: This database records 1,392 drugs and their 27 different side effects or adverse reactions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kuhn, M., Campillos, M., Letunic, I., Jensen, L. J., & Bork, P. (2010). A side effect resource to capture phenotypic effects of drugs. *Molecular Systems Biology*, 6(1), 343.

7. **Toxcast Database**: This toxicological research database has 8,599 SMILES along with labels for 617 predictive tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dix, D. J., Houck, K. A., Martin, M. T., Richard, A. M., Setzer, R. W., & Kavlock, R. J. (2006). The Toxcast program for prioritizing toxicity testing of environmental chemicals. *Toxicological Sciences*, 95(1), 5–12.

8. **Sydney Urban Point Cloud Dataset**: This dataset contains street objects scanned with a Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR, collected in the CBD of Sydney, Australia. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided, so I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in the field.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, especially for those that are explicitly mentioned in the paper. For datasets without explicit citations, I will note their common usage in the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
