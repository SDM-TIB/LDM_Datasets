To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMC-NCA: Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast for Semi-supervised Temporal Action Segmentation" by Feixiang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for fully labeled datasets for temporal action segmentation and refer to the use of semi-supervised approaches. This implies that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their method on three public action segmentation datasets: 

1. **50Salads**: This dataset consists of 50 videos containing 19 actions.
2. **GTEA**: This dataset includes 28 videos with 11 actions.
3. **Breakfast Actions**: This dataset comprises 1712 videos featuring 10 complex activities and 48 actions.

Additionally, the authors introduce a new dataset called the **Parkinson’s Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB)** dataset, which is specifically designed to study the behavioral patterns of mice with Parkinson’s Disease.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **50Salads**, the citation is:
  > Stein, S., & McKenna, S. J. (2013). Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (pp. 729–738).

- For **GTEA**, the citation is:
  > Fathi, A., Ren, X., & Rehg, J. M. (2011). Learning to recognize objects in egocentric activities. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 3281–3288).

- For **Breakfast Actions**, the citation is:

- For the **Parkinson’s Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Zhou, F., Jiang, Z., Liu, Z., Chen, F., Chen, L., Tong, L., Yang, Z., Wang, H., Fei, M., & Zhou, H. (2021). Structured context enhancement network for mouse pose estimation. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 32(5), 2787–2801.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
