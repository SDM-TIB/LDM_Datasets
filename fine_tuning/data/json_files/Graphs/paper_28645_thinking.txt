To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSC: Deep Scan Context Descriptor for Large-Scale Place Recognition" by Jiafeng Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **KITTI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely a key component of the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of place recognition and reference various methods, but the focus on the **KITTI dataset** is reiterated, suggesting it is the primary dataset used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they followed the experiment settings of SSC on the **KITTI odometry dataset**, which includes 11 sequences (00-10) with ground truth poses. This confirms that the **KITTI dataset** is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **KITTI dataset**. The citation for the KITTI dataset is as follows:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **KITTI dataset**, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
