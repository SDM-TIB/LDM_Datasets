To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Neighborhood Selection Guided Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks" by Hao Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the datasets used, while the introduction may elaborate on their significance in the context of the research. The methodology section typically describes how the datasets were utilized, and the experimental results section will confirm which datasets were employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on **three representative and general-purpose datasets**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experimental sections. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments as follows:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of user reviews from Yelp, specifically filtered for spam and recommended reviews. It includes various metadata such as review content, timestamps, and star ratings.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset includes consumer reviews from Amazon, focusing on the musical instrument category. It contains features such as user voting rates and review content.

3. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A publicly available dataset consisting of health records from ICU patients, which includes various medical information such as diagnoses and procedures.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**:
  > Julian John McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897–908, 2013.

- For the **Amazon Dataset**:
  > Julian John McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897–908, 2013.

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**:
  > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3, 1 (2016), 1–9.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
