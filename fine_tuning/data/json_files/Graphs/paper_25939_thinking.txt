To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GrAMME: Semi-Supervised Learning using Multi-layered Graph Attention Models" by Uday Shankar Shanthamallu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Empirical Studies)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they provide a summary table (Table II) and detailed descriptions of each dataset. I will extract the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Vickers-Chan Dataset**: This dataset represents the social structure of students from a school in Victoria, Australia, with 29 nodes representing students and labels based on gender.

2. **Congress Votes Dataset**: This dataset consists of voting records from the 1984 United States Congressional Voting Records Database, featuring 435 congressmen and 16 layers based on their votes on different bills.

3. **Leskovec-Ng Dataset**: A temporal collaboration network of professors Jure Leskovec and Andrew Ng, partitioned into 4 layers based on co-authorship over 20 years.

4. **Reinnovation Dataset**: This dataset describes the Global Innovation Index for 144 countries, with 12 layers representing similarities between countries in different sectors.

5. **Mammography Dataset (UCI)**: Contains information about mammographic mass lesions from 961 subjects, with labels indicating whether lesions are benign or malignant.

6. **CKM Dataset**: Collected from physicians in four different towns, modeling information diffusion through social networks with 3 layers based on questionnaire responses.

7. **Balance Scale Dataset**: Summarizes results from a psychological experiment with 4 attributes, classifying subjects based on balance scale outcomes.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- **Vickers-Chan Dataset**: 
  > M. Vickers and S. Chan, "Representing classroom social structure," Victoria Institute of Secondary Education, Melbourne, 1981.

- **Congress Votes Dataset**: 
  > J. C. Schlimmer, "Concept acquisition through representational adjustment," 1987.

- **Leskovec-Ng Dataset**: 
  > P.-Y. Chen and A. O. Hero, "Multilayer spectral graph clustering via convex layer aggregation: Theory and algorithms," IEEE Trans. Signal Inf. Process. Netw., vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 553–567, 2017.

- **Reinnovation Dataset**: 
  > J. Coleman, E. Katz, and H. Menzel, "The diffusion of an innovation among physicians," Sociometry, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 253–270, 1957.

- **Mammography Dataset**: 
  > D. Dua and C. Graff, "UCI machine learning repository," 2017.

- **CKM Dataset**: 
  > H. Zhang, L. Qiu, L. Yi, and Y. Song, "Scalable multiplex network embedding," in IJCAI, 2018, pp. 3082–3088.

- **Balance Scale Dataset**: 
  > D. Dua and C. Graff, "UCI machine learning repository," 2017.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
