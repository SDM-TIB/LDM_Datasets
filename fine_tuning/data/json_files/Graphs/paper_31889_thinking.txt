To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Structural Brain Network Construction by Hierarchical Prototype Embedding GCN using T1-MRI" by Yilin Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 databases**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that the data used are from two public databases: **ADNI-1** and **ADNI-2**. The authors also provide demographic information and preprocessing steps, which confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ADNI-1**, the citation is:
  > Ronald Carl Petersen, Paul S Aisen, Laurel A Beckett, Michael C Donohue, Anthony Collins Gamst, Danielle J Harvey, Clifford R Jack, William J Jagust, Leslie M Shaw, Arthur W Toga, et al. *Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI): clinical characterization*. Neurology, 74(3):201–209, 2010.

- For **ADNI-2**, the citation is:
  > Ronald Carl Petersen, Paul S Aisen, Laurel A Beckett, Michael C Donohue, Anthony Collins Gamst, Danielle J Harvey, Clifford R Jack, William J Jagust, Leslie M Shaw, Arthur W Toga, et al. *Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI): clinical characterization*. Neurology, 74(3):201–209, 2010. (Note: The citation for ADNI-2 is often the same as ADNI-1, as it is part of the same initiative.)

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ADNI-1**: A dataset used for studying Alzheimer's disease, containing MRI images and demographic information of subjects.
2. **ADNI-2**: An extension of the ADNI-1 dataset, also focused on Alzheimer's disease, with additional subjects and imaging data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
