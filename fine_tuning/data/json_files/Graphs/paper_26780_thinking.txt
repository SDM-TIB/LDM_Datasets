To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network Architecture Search for Molecular Property Prediction" by Shengli Jiang and Prasanna Balaprakash, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on molecular property prediction using datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **Section II (MoleculeNet Benchmark)**, where the authors categorize the datasets into two groups: Quantum Physics and Physical Chemistry. This section provides explicit names and descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments.

1. **Quantum Physics Datasets**:
   - **QM7**: A subset of the GDB-13 database containing 7,160 molecules and their corresponding atomization energies.
   - **QM8**: A subset of the GDB-17 database with 21,786 molecules and four excited-state properties.
   - **QM9**: Contains 133,865 molecules with twelve properties, including geometric and thermodynamic properties.

2. **Physical Chemistry Datasets**:
   - **ESOL**: Contains water solubility data for 1,128 molecules.
   - **FreeSolv**: Comprises hydration-free energy data for 642 small molecules.
   - **Lipophilicity**: Provides experimental results for the octanol/water distribution coefficient for 4,200 molecules.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **QM7**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A benchmark for molecular machine learning. *Chemical Science*, 9(2), 513-530.

- For **QM8**, the citation is:
  > Ruddigkeit, L., Van Deursen, R., Blum, L. C., & Reymond, J.-L. (2012). Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database GDB-17. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 52(11), 2864-2875.

- For **QM9**, the citation is the same as QM8 since it is part of the GDB-17 database.

- For **ESOL**, the citation is:
  > Delaney, J. S. (2004). ESOL: Estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*, 44(3), 1000-1005.

- For **FreeSolv**, the citation is:
  > Mobley, D. L., & Guthrie, J. P. (2014). FreeSolv: A database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies, with input files. *Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design*, 28(7), 711-720.

- For **Lipophilicity**, the citation is:
  > Davies, M., Nowotka, M., Papadatos, G., Dedman, N., Gaulton, A., Atkinson, F., Bellis, L., & Overington, J. P. (2015). ChEMBL web services: Streamlining access to drug discovery data and utilities. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 43(W1), W612-W620.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
