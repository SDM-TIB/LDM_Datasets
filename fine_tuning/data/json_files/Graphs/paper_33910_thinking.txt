To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DCL-NET: Dual Contrastive Learning Network for Semi-Supervised Multi-Organ Segmentation" by Lu Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **2017 ACDC dataset** and an **in-house RC-OARs dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-organ segmentation and the need for effective datasets. They mention the **ACDC dataset** and the **RC-OARs dataset** again, confirming their relevance to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They specify that the **ACDC dataset** is a public MRI dataset from the MICCAI 2017 challenge, which includes 150 patients with segmentation labels for three organs: left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium. The **RC-OARs dataset** is described as an in-house CT dataset containing 130 rectum cancer patients with segmentation labels for four organs: bladder, small intestine, right femoral head, and left femoral head.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The ACDC dataset is referenced as follows:
- **ACDC Dataset**: 
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., & Ballester, M. A. G. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514-2525.

The RC-OARs dataset is an in-house dataset, so it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ACDC dataset and a description for the RC-OARs dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the extracted dataset information in a structured format for further use or analysis.
