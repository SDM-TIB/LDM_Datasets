To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Click-Through Rate Prediction with Auto-Quantized Contrastive Learning" by Yujie Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which suggests that I should find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset is composed of product reviews from the Amazon website, specifically focusing on the Beauty category. The task involves predicting whether a user will comment on a certain item.

2. **Ta Feng Dataset**: This is a sparse grocery shopping dataset released by ACM RecSys, covering transactions from various product categories. The goal is to predict whether a user will buy a certain item.

3. **Oncold Dataset**: This dataset is described as an industrial dataset collected from real-world online cold-start recommendation feeds, characterized by extreme sparsity in user interactions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how they split the datasets for training, validation, and testing, which is useful for understanding the datasets' application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Amazon Dataset**, the citation is:
  > He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 2016.

- For the **Ta Feng Dataset**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is referenced as a sparse grocery shopping dataset released by ACM RecSys, but the specific citation is not provided in the text. I will note that it is commonly cited in the context of grocery shopping datasets.

- For the **Oncold Dataset**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is described as an industrial dataset collected from May to July 2021, but no specific citation is provided in the text. I will note that it is used in the context of cold-start recommendation feeds.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
