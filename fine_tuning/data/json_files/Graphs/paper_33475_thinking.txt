To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Detection with Contrastively-learned Prompt" by Jiaqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel framework for unsupervised continual anomaly detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges in unsupervised anomaly detection, hinting at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **MVTec AD Dataset**: This dataset is described as the most widely used dataset for industrial image anomaly detection, comprising 15 categories with a total of 1725 normal and abnormal images, along with 3629 normal images for training. The resolution of the images varies from 700×700 to 1024×1024 pixels.

2. **VisA Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the largest dataset for real-world industrial anomaly detection, containing pixel-level annotations. It consists of 10,821 images, including 9,621 normal samples and 1,200 abnormal samples, with various structural and surface anomalies.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MVTec AD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bergmann, P., Fauser, M., Sattlegger, D., & Steger, C. (2019). MVTec AD–A comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 9592–9600).

- For the **VisA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zou, Y., Jeong, J., Pemula, L., Zhang, D., & Dabeer, O. (2022). Spot-the-difference self-supervised pre-training for anomaly detection and segmentation. In Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 392–408).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
