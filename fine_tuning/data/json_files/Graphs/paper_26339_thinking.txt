To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Independence Promoted Graph Disentangled Networks" by Yanbei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental studies validate the model on "real-world graphs," which suggests that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify any dataset names, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on three standard citation network benchmark datasets. I will look for a section that lists these datasets explicitly.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the source of these datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is the same as for Cora, as both datasets are part of the same benchmark collection.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is also the same:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Cora**
   - Description: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **Citeseer**
   - Description: A citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **Pubmed**
   - Description: A citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
