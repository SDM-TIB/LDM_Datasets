To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CROSS-AGE CONTRASTIVE LEARNING FOR AGE-INVARIANT FACE RECOGNITION" by Haoyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of collecting age-oriented datasets and hints at the use of benchmarks for evaluation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their method on three commonly used AIFR benchmark datasets:

1. **FG-NET Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,002 facial images of 82 subjects, with each subject having more than 10 images taken over a long time span.

2. **MORPH II Dataset**: The largest dataset among the three, containing over 55,000 images of approximately 13,000 subjects, with ages ranging from 16 to 77.

3. **CACD-VS Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,000 positive pairs and 2,000 negative pairs, where positive pairs consist of images of the same subject, and negative pairs consist of images of different subjects.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For **FG-NET Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Cootes and A. Lanitis, “The fg-net aging database,” 2008.

- For **MORPH II Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Ricanek and Tamirat Tesafaye, “Morph: A longitudinal image database of normal adult age-progression,” in 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FGR06). IEEE, 2006, pp. 341–345.

- For **CACD-VS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bor-Chun Chen, Chu-Song Chen, and Winston H Hsu, “Cross-age reference coding for age-invariant face recognition and retrieval,” in European conference on computer vision. Springer, 2014, pp. 768–783.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
