To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation via Contrastive Motion Clustering" by Lin Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets: **DAVIS16, FBMS, and SegTrackV2**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **DAVIS16**: This dataset is described as a popular benchmark for video object segmentation, consisting of 50 high-quality video sequences with pixel-wise ground truth annotations. The authors mention using the validation set for their experiments.

2. **FBMS**: This dataset contains videos of multiple moving objects and has 59 sparsely annotated video sequences, with 30 sequences designated for validation.

3. **SegTrackV2**: This dataset includes 14 densely annotated videos and 976 annotated frames, featuring various challenges such as motion blur and occlusion.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DAVIS16**, the citation is:
  > F. Perazzi, J. Pont-Tuset, B. McWilliams, L. Van Gool, M. Gross, and A. Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2016, pp. 724–732.

- For **FBMS**, the citation is:
  > P. Ochs, J. Malik, and T. Brox. *Segmentation of moving objects by long term video analysis*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 36, no. 6, pp. 1187–1200, 2014.

- For **SegTrackV2**, the citation is:
  > F. Li, T. Kim, A. Humayun, D. Tsai, and J. M. Rehg. *Video segmentation by tracking many figure-ground segments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2013, pp. 2192–2199.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
