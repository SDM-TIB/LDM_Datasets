To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Picture of the Space of Typical Learnable Tasks" by Rahul Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention using classification tasks constructed from the **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **Methods** section, where the authors typically elaborate on the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors specifically mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 10 classes of images, each with RGB images of size 32x32.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1000 classes, each containing approximately 1000 RGB images of size 224x224.

I will also check the **Results** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about how they were utilized.

After confirming the datasets in the **Results** section, I will then refer to the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. PhD thesis, Computer Science, University of Toronto.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
