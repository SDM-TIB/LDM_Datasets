To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semi-supervised Gaussian Mixture Models for Generalized Category Discovery" by Bingchen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on both generic image classification datasets and fine-grained object recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, which is widely used for image classification tasks.

4. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200 dataset, which contains images of 200 bird species, often used for fine-grained classification.

5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing images of cars, used for fine-grained classification tasks.

6. **FGVC-Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained visual classification of aircraft, containing images of various aircraft models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:

  > Subhransu Maji, Esa Rahtu, Juho Kannala, Matthew Blaschko, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Fine-grained visual classification of aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
