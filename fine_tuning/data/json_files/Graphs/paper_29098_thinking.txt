To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Pay Attention to Relations: Multi-embeddings for Attributed Multiplex Networks" by Joshua Melton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on four real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note the names of these datasets as I encounter them.

Next, I will look into **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their properties and specific characteristics.

In **subsection V-A (Datasets)**, the authors list the four datasets used:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset consists of product metadata from the Electronics category on Amazon.com, including attributes like price, sales rank, brand, and category.

2. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset contains tweets and user interactions related to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, specifically focusing on the reply, retweet, and mention networks among users.

3. **YouTube Dataset**: This dataset describes the co-occurrence of friends, subscriptions, favorited videos, and contacts between users on YouTube.

4. **Tissue-PPI Dataset**: This dataset consists of protein interactions across 107 tissue types in the human body, focusing on the ten largest network layers.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Amazon Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
