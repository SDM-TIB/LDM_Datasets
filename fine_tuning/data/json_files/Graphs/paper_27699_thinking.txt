To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Home Action Genome: Cooperative Compositional Action Understanding" by Nishant Rai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract introduces the **Home Action Genome (HOMAGE)** dataset, which is a multi-view action dataset with hierarchical activity and atomic action labels. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for more details about the HOMAGE dataset. The authors describe it as a benchmark for action recognition that includes multi-modal synchronized videos from multiple viewpoints, along with hierarchical action and atomic-action labels. This reinforces the significance of the HOMAGE dataset.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference several other datasets that are relevant to their research. I will take note of these datasets as they may provide context or comparisons for the HOMAGE dataset. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Kinetics**: A large-scale dataset for action recognition.
2. **Charades**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.
3. **ActivityNet**: A benchmark for human activity understanding.
4. **UCF101**: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild.
5. **EPIC Kitchens**: A dataset for ego-centric action recognition.
6. **Action Genome**: A dataset focusing on using scene information in action recognition.
7. **MMAct**: A large-scale action recognition benchmark with multimodal data.

Next, I will look for the **datasets section** or any part of the paper that discusses the specifics of the HOMAGE dataset. In the **data collection section**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of participants, activities, and the types of sensors used. They mention that the dataset includes 1,752 synchronized sequences and 5,700 videos in total, annotated with 75 activities and 453 atomic actions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations for the datasets referenced in the related work section are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper.
