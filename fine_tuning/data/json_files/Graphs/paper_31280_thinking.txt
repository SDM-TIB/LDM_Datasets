To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning for Urban Imagery-based Socioeconomic Prediction" by Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets related to urban imagery and socioeconomic indicators, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Beijing Dataset**: This dataset includes urban imagery and socioeconomic indicators such as population, economic activity, restaurant business, and consumption data. The authors specify that the population data is sourced from WorldPop, economic activity data from a specific reference, and consumption data from a life service platform.

2. **Shanghai Dataset**: Similar to the Beijing dataset, this dataset contains urban imagery and socioeconomic indicators, specifically population and economic activity data from the same sources as the Beijing dataset.

3. **New York Dataset**: This dataset includes urban imagery and socioeconomic indicators such as population, education data from SafeGraph, and crime data from NYC Open Data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the sources of the socioeconomic data mentioned for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Beijing Dataset**:
  > Population data from WorldPop. (2022). WorldPop. Retrieved from https://www.worldpop.org/

- For the **Shanghai Dataset**:
  > Population and economic activity data from WorldPop. (2022). WorldPop. Retrieved from https://www.worldpop.org/

- For the **New York Dataset**:
  > Population data from SafeGraph. (2022). SafeGraph. Retrieved from https://www.safegraph.com/
  > Crime data from NYC Open Data. (2022). NYC Open Data. Retrieved from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
