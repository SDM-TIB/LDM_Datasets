To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph-Based Multimodal Brain Network Learning" by Gen Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 224 subjects, including 147 patients with orthostatic hypotension and 77 healthy controls. The authors describe the data augmentation strategy used to balance the dataset, resulting in a total of 1470 brain networks for patients and 1540 for healthy controls.

2. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Dataset**: This well-known dataset includes 512 subjects, categorized into cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) groups. The authors note that for their experiments, all MCI and AD subjects were treated as patients.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) Dataset**, since it is a private dataset, there may not be a formal citation available. However, I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for their specific study.

- For the **ADNI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weiner, M. W., Veitch, D. P., Aisen, P. S., Beckett, L. A., Cairns, N. J., Green, R. C., Harvey, D., Jack, C. R., Jagust, W., Morris, J. C., et al. (2017). The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3: Continued innovation for clinical trial improvement. *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, 13(5), 561–571.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
