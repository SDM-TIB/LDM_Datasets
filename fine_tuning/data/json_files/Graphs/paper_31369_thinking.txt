To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Soundness of XAI in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)" by David Solís-Martín et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a DCNN model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an aircraft engine, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly in **subsection 3.1 (Dataset and black-box model)**. Here, the authors discuss the **CMAPSS dataset** and the **N-CMAPSS dataset**. I will extract the details provided about these datasets:

1. **CMAPSS Dataset**: This dataset was developed at NASA and is well-known in the field of predictive maintenance. It is used for modeling and simulating the RUL of aircraft engines.

2. **N-CMAPSS Dataset**: This dataset is a more recent creation that provides the full history of trajectories from a healthy condition until failure occurs. It includes various failure modes and is structured to support RUL predictions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CMAPSS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saxena, A., Goebel, K., Simon, D., & Eklund, N. (2008). Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation. In *2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management* (pp. 1-9). IEEE.

- For the **N-CMAPSS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arias Chao, M., Kulkarni, C., Goebel, K., & Fink, O. (2021). Aircraft engine run-to-failure dataset under real flight conditions for prognostics and diagnostics. *Data*, 6(1), 5.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
