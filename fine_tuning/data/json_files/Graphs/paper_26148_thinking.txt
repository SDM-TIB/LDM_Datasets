To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Popularity Prediction on Social Platforms with Coupled Graph Neural Networks" by Qi Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data Set**: This dataset is generated using a Kronecker generator, which creates networks with properties similar to real networks. The authors provide details about the number of nodes and edges, as well as the method used to generate information cascades.

2. **Sina Weibo Data Set**: This is a real-world dataset sourced from Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. The authors specify that this dataset includes 1.78 million users and 308 million following relationships, along with 300,000 popular microblog retweet information cascades.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the following works related to the datasets:

- For the **synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec, Deepayan Chakrabarti, Jon Kleinberg, Christos Faloutsos, and Zoubin Ghahramani. *Kronecker Graphs: An Approach to Modeling Networks*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11, 985–1042, 2010.

- For the **Sina Weibo dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jing Zhang, Biao Liu, Jie Tang, Ting Chen, and Juanzi Li. *Social Influence Locality for Modeling Retweeting Behaviors*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI ’13), 2761–2767, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
