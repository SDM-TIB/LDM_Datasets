To extract datasets from the research paper titled "People Still Care About Facts: Twitter Users Engage More with Factual Discourse than Misinformationâ€”A Comparison Between COVID and General Narratives on Twitter" by Mirela Silva et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze a curated dataset of **2.1 million tweets** related to COVID-19 misinformation and factual claims, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (COVID Misinformation and Factual Datasets: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering)**, where the authors detail the datasets they used. They mention several datasets that were combined to create their own datasets for analysis. 

The datasets mentioned include:

1. **COVID-19 Misinformation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from multiple sources, including:
   - **Dataset 1**: Released by Shashi et al., containing 1,736 tweets fact-checked by professional organizations.
   - **Dataset 2**: Tweets related to COVID-19 conspiracy theories linked to 5G networks, collected by Schroeder et al.
   - **Dataset 3**: The CoAID dataset by Cui and Lee, which includes tweets labeled as fake or factual.
   - **Dataset 4**: The COVID-19 Twitter fake news dataset by Paka et al., which includes labeled tweets.
   - **Dataset 5**: Tweets related to anti-vaccine narratives collected by Muric et al.

2. **General Topics Misinformation Dataset**: This dataset is also composed of multiple sources, including:
   - **Dataset 6**: CREDBANK dataset by Mitra and Gilbert, which includes tweets rated for credibility.
   - **Dataset 7**: Russian Troll Tweets dataset, which contains tweets from malicious accounts.
   - **Dataset 8**: A dataset of fact-checked tweets by Vo and Lee.
   - **Dataset 9**: User comments dataset collected by Jiang et al.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution:

- **Dataset 1**: 
  > Shashi, G., et al. (2020). *Misinformation_COVID-19*. GitHub repository. https://github.com/Gautamshahi/Misinformation_COVID-19

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
