To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Revise References for Faithful Summarization" by Griffin Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a critical component of their research. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of summarizing clinical notes and mention the MIMIC-III dataset as a source of noisy references. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their study.

In the **data section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MIMIC-III dataset, including its purpose and the context in which it is used. They describe it as containing de-identified clinical records from patients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any specific details about how the MIMIC-III dataset is utilized in their experiments. The authors confirm that they use the Brief Hospital Course section of the discharge summaries as references for summarization tasks, which is a crucial detail for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: 
  > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MIMIC-III dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the MIMIC-III dataset as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have located its full citation. I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
