To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks with Parallel Neighborhood Aggregations for Graph Classification" by Siddhant Doshi and Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the specific tasks they were used for.

In section 5, the authors mention that they evaluated their model on **twelve benchmark datasets** for graph classification, which include:

1. **D&D Dataset**: A dataset for graph classification tasks.
2. **NCI1 Dataset**: A dataset used for chemical compound classification.
3. **PROTEINS Dataset**: A dataset for protein classification.
4. **ENZYMES Dataset**: A dataset for enzyme classification.
5. **OGBG-MOLHIV Dataset**: A large-scale molecular graph dataset.
6. **IMDB-BINARY Dataset**: A dataset for binary classification of movie graphs.
7. **IMDB-MULTI Dataset**: A dataset for multi-class classification of movie graphs.
8. **REDDIT-BINARY Dataset**: A dataset for binary classification of Reddit posts.
9. **REDDIT-MULTI Dataset**: A dataset for multi-class classification of Reddit posts.
10. **COLLAB Dataset**: A dataset for collaboration networks.
11. **OHSU Dataset**: A dataset related to brain networks.
12. **PEKING-1 Dataset**: Another dataset related to brain networks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
