To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning Linguistic Words and Visual Semantic Units for Image Captioning" by Longteng Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **MS-COCO image captioning dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely a key component of their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, particularly the **Experiments** section. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on the **MS-COCO dataset** and also utilized the **Visual Genome (VG) dataset** for training their object detector, attribute classifier, and relationship detector.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as the most popular benchmark for image captioning, containing 113,287 training images with five captions each, and 5,000 images for validation and test splits. The authors follow the 'Karpathy' splits for their experiments.

2. **Visual Genome (VG) Dataset**: This dataset is used to train the object detector, attribute classifier, and relationship detector. It includes vocabularies of 305 objects, 103 attributes, and 64 relationships.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsungyi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
