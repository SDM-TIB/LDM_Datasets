To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brain Tissue Segmentation Across the Human Lifespan via Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Xiaoyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "large-scale dataset of 2,464 MR images," which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of T1- and T2-weighted image pairs from five Lifespan Human Connectome Projects. I will list these projects as they are crucial for understanding the dataset's composition:

1. **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**: This project includes images from infants with a gestational age of 37 – 44 weeks.
2. **Baby Connectome Project (BCP)**: This dataset covers ages from 0 to 5 years.
3. **HCP Development (HCP-D)**: This dataset includes subjects aged 6 to 22 years.
4. **HCP Young Adult (HCP-YA)**: This dataset covers ages from 22 to 37 years.
5. **HCP Aging (HCP-A)**: This dataset includes subjects aged 36 to 100 years.

The authors specify that out of the total 2,462 image pairs, 682 were used for training, 113 for validation, and the rest for testing. They also mention that 62 images were manually annotated, which is important for understanding the dataset's quality.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of the Lifespan Human Connectome Projects mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**:

- **HCP Young Adult (HCP-YA)**:

- **HCP Aging (HCP-A)**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
