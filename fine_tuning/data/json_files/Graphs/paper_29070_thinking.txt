To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Impact of Negative Samples of Contrastive Learning: A Case Study of Sentence Embedding" by Rui Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their proposed model, MoCoSE, on the semantic text similarity (STS) task. This indicates that there may be datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors state that they conduct experiments on **seven standard semantic text similarity (STS) tasks**, including STS 2012—2016, STSBenchmark, and SICK-Relatedness. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. **STS 2012**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
