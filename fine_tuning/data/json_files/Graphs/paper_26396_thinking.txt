To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Get Rid of Suspended Animation Problem: Deep Diffusive Neural Network on Graph Semi-Supervised Classification" by Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed model, DIFNET, and mentions that extensive experiments will be conducted on benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the author states that the effectiveness of DIFNET will be tested on several commonly used graph benchmark datasets, specifically mentioning **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used for evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references other works that likely describe them. I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   - The citation is:
     > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *CoRR*, abs/1609.02907.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   - The citation is:
     > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *CoRR*, abs/1609.02907.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   - The citation is:
     > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *CoRR*, abs/1609.02907.

Since the paper uses these datasets for semi-supervised node classification, I will ensure to include the original citation for the GCN paper as it is the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
