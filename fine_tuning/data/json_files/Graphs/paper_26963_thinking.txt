To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strongly Incremental Constituency Parsing with Graph Neural Networks" by Kaiyu Yang and Jia Deng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their parser on **Penn Treebank (PTB)** and **Chinese Treebank (CTB)**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors confirm that they evaluate their method on PTB and CTB, providing some context about the datasets. They mention that PTB consists of 39,832 training examples, 1,700 validation examples, and 2,416 testing examples, while CTB consists of 17,544 training examples, 352 validation examples, and 348 testing examples.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P Marcus and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

- For **Chinese Treebank (CTB)**, the citation is:
  > Naiwen Xue, Fei Xia, Fu-Dong Chiou, and Marta Palmer. *The Penn Chinese Treebank: Phrase structure annotation of a large corpus*. Natural Language Engineering, 11(2):207–219, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
