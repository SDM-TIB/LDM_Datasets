To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sym-parameterized Dynamic Inference for Mixed-Domain Image Translation" by Simyung Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss their method and its application to image translation, which may involve specific datasets.

I will also check the **related work section** for any references to datasets that are commonly used in the field of image-to-image translation. This section often cites foundational datasets that may be relevant to the authors' work.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsections that explicitly list the datasets used. If such a section exists, it will likely provide detailed descriptions, including the number of images, types of images, and any specific characteristics of the datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Van Gogh dataset** for training, I will look for the citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the context in which it was mentioned and search for the original source if necessary.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, and include the full citation for each dataset as found in the references section.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
