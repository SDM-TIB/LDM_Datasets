To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Causal Bandits for Linear Models" by Zirui Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is crucial as it often details the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their results. They may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized, any preprocessing steps taken, and the outcomes of their experiments based on these datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "Penn Action Dataset" and the "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will note the details provided in the paper, such as the number of samples, types of annotations, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for further processing or review.
