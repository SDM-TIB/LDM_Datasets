To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dual-Perception Graph Neural Network with Multi-hop Graph Generator" by Li Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "five datasets with different topological structures," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are likely described in the **Experiments** section, where the authors evaluate their proposed model.

Upon reviewing the **Experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention five datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Flickr, BlogCatalog, and ACM**. Each dataset is described in terms of its characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, average degree, and features.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, an average degree of 4.01, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, an average degree of 2.84, and 3,703 features.
3. **Flickr**: A social network with 7,575 nodes, 239,738 edges, 9 classes, an average degree of 63.30, and 12,047 features.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network with 5,196 nodes, 171,743 edges, 6 classes, an average degree of 66.11, and 8,189 features.
5. **ACM**: A co-authorship network with 3,025 nodes, 13,128 edges, 3 classes, an average degree of 8.68, and 1,870 features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references of the papers that introduced or used them.

- For **Cora** and **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Meng, Z., Liang, S., Bao, H., & Zhang, X. (2019). Co-embedding attributed networks. In *Proceedings of the twelfth ACM international conference on web search and data mining*, 393–401.

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > Meng, Z., Liang, S., Bao, H., & Zhang, X. (2019). Co-embedding attributed networks. In *Proceedings of the twelfth ACM international conference on web search and data mining*, 393–401.

- For **ACM**, the citation is:
  > Wang, D., Cui, P., & Zhu, W. (2019). Structural deep network embedding. In *Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining*, 1225–1234.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its characteristics and full citation.
