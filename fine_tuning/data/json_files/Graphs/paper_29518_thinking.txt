To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Moments of Change from Longitudinal User Text" by Adam Tsakalidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a **corpus of 500 manually annotated user timelines** consisting of **18.7K posts**. This suggests that there is a dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Dataset creation)**, where the authors detail how they created the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **500 user timelines** extracted from **Talklife**, a peer-to-peer network for mental health support. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's content and context.

In **section 3.1 (Data Acquisition)**, the authors explain that they collected a complete dataset from Talklife, which includes **12.3 million posts from 1.1 million users**. However, they specifically focus on the **500 user timelines** for their analysis. This indicates that the dataset is not only large but also specifically curated for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Talklife dataset. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that it was anonymized and provided under a license agreement. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from Talklife, and I will include a citation for the Talklife platform itself, which is accessible at https://www.talklife.com/.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Moments of Change Dataset
   - **Description**: A longitudinal dataset of 500 user timelines containing 18,702 posts, annotated for moments of change in mood (Switches and Escalations).
   - **Source**: Talklife, a peer-to-peer mental health support platform.
   - **Citation**: Talklife. Available at: https://www.talklife.com/

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
