To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESGCN: Edge Squeeze Attention Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting" by Sangrok Lee and Ha Young Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on **four real-world datasets (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08)**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they mention that the framework is validated on the four datasets, and they provide a table (Table 2) that summarizes the dataset descriptions and statistics. This table includes important details such as the number of nodes, missing ratio, and the date ranges for each dataset.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **PEMS03**: Contains traffic flow data with a missing ratio of 0.672% and data collected from 9/1/2018 to 11/30/2018.
2. **PEMS04**: Contains traffic flow data with a missing ratio of 3.182% and data collected from 1/1/2018 to 2/28/2018.
3. **PEMS07**: Contains traffic flow data with a missing ratio of 0.452% and data collected from 5/1/2017 to 8/31/2017.
4. **PEMS08**: Contains traffic flow data with a missing ratio of 0.696% and data collected from 7/1/2016 to 8/31/2016.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as being used in their experiments, and they cite the original source of these datasets, which is:

- **PEMS datasets**: 
  > Song, C., Lin, Y., Guo, S., & Wan, H. (2020). Spatial-temporal synchronous graph convolutional networks: A new framework for spatial-temporal network data forecasting. In AAAI, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its key attributes, including the name, description, and citation.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
