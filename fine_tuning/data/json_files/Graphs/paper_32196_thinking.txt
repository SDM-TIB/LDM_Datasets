To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Internal Contrastive Learning for Generalized Out-of-distribution Fault Diagnosis (GOOFD) Framework" by Xingyue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a simulated benchmark dataset and two practical process datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Tennessee Eastman (TE) process dataset**, the **Semi-Conductor Manufacturing (SECOM) dataset**, and the **Multi-phase Flow Facility (MFF) dataset**. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how each dataset is used:
1. **Tennessee Eastman (TE) process dataset**: This dataset is used for both process monitoring and open-set fault diagnosis (OSFD). It contains 21 faults and is generated from a chemical model simulation platform.
2. **Semi-Conductor Manufacturing (SECOM) dataset**: This dataset consists of 1567 examples with 591 features, used for process monitoring with binary labels (pass/fail).
3. **Multi-phase Flow Facility (MFF) dataset**: This dataset includes normal data and six fault cases, used for OSFD.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For the **Tennessee Eastman (TE) process dataset**:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2017.
  
- For the **Semi-Conductor Manufacturing (SECOM) dataset**:
  > C. Ruiz-Cárcel, Y. Cao, D. Mba, L. Lao, and R.T. Samuel. *Statistical process monitoring of a multiphase flow facility*. Control Engineering Practice, 42:74–88, 2015.

- For the **Multi-phase Flow Facility (MFF) dataset**:
  > C. Ruiz-Cárcel, Y. Cao, D. Mba, L. Lao, and R.T. Samuel. *Statistical process monitoring of a multiphase flow facility*. Control Engineering Practice, 42:74–88, 2015.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.
