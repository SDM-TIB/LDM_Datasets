To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KSG: Knowledge and Skill Graph" by Feng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of a Knowledge and Skill Graph (KSG) and mentions the use of CN-DBpedia as a foundational dataset. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Knowledge and Skill Graph)**, where the authors describe the construction of KSG based on CN-DBpedia. They mention that KSG incorporates dynamic behavioral information and includes various nodes related to agents, environments, and skills. I will look for any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section 2.1 (Training Skills for Data Preparation)**, the authors mention that they trained skills using agents from Mujoco. This suggests that Mujoco is a dataset or framework used in their experiments. I will note this down.

In **section 2.2 (Knowledge Fusion)**, they discuss the integration of CN-DBpedia into the KSG. This section confirms that CN-DBpedia is a key dataset for their work.

In **section 3 (Experiments and Applications of KSG)**, the authors describe the applications of KSG and how it can be used for skill retrieval and learning. They mention the environments used for training, such as "plane," "obstacle," and "stair," but these are not datasets in the traditional sense. Instead, they are experimental setups.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CN-DBpedia**: The citation is:
   > Bo Xu, Yong Xu, Jiaqing Liang, Chenhao Xie, Bin Liang, Wanyun Cui, and Yanghua Xiao. *CN-DBpedia: A Never-Ending Chinese Knowledge Extraction System*. In International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems. Springer, 428–438, 2017.

2. **Mujoco**: The citation is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. IEEE, 5026–5033, 2012.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **CN-DBpedia**: A dataset used as the foundational knowledge base for constructing the KSG.
- **Mujoco**: A physics engine used for training various agents in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
