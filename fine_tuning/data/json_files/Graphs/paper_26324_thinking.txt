To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer-Dependent Importance Sampling for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks" by Difan Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on benchmark datasets for node classification, specifically **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, and **Reddit**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **Cora Dataset**: A widely used dataset for citation networks, consisting of 2,708 documents classified into one of seven classes.
   - Citation: 
     > M. Sen, G. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Galligher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–93, 2008.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 documents classified into six classes.
   - Citation:
     > M. Sen, G. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Galligher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–93, 2008.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: A dataset containing 19,717 scientific publications classified into three classes.
   - Citation:
     > M. Sen, G. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Galligher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–93, 2008.

4. **Reddit Dataset**: A large dataset consisting of 232,965 posts classified into multiple classes.
   - Citation:
     > W. Hamilton, R. Ying, and J. Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30, pages 1025–1035, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
