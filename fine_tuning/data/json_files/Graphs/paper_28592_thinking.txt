To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blind VQA on 360째 Video via Progressively Learning from Pixels, Frames and Video" by Li Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments validate the proposed method on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **VQA-ODV dataset**: This dataset consists of 540 impaired 360째 videos derived from 60 reference 360째 videos, with various types of impairments applied. The authors provide details about the resolution and the subjective quality scoring process.

2. **BIT360 dataset**: This dataset includes 16 reference 360째 videos and 384 impaired videos produced by applying different distortions. The authors also describe the subjective quality scoring for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **VQA-ODV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, M., Li, C., Du, X., & Wang, Z. (2018). Bridge the gap between VQA and human behavior on omnidirectional video: A large-scale dataset and a deep learning model. In *Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia* (pp. 1-9).

- For the **BIT360 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, B., & et al. (2017). Subjective and objective quality assessment of panoramic videos in virtual reality environments. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo* (ICME), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
