To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Language Pre-Training for Boosting Scene Text Detectors" by Sibo Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of vision-language joint representation learning for scene text detection, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of scene text detection and the importance of pre-training techniques, hinting at the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **SynthText**: A large-scale dataset containing about 800,000 synthetic images used for pre-training. The authors specify that they only use text labels without bounding box annotations.

2. **Total-Text**: This dataset focuses on curved text and contains 1,255 training images and 300 test images, labeled with polygon-shaped bounding boxes.

3. **CTW1500**: Another dataset primarily consisting of curved text, with 1,000 training images and 500 test images, where text instances are labeled with polygons annotated by 14 vertices.

4. **ICDAR2015**: Composed of 1,000 training images and 500 test images, with text annotations provided in word level with rectangular bounding boxes.

5. **ICDAR2017**: A multilingual dataset that includes 7,200 training images, 1,800 validation images, and 9,000 test images.

6. **MSRA-TD500**: This dataset includes 300 training images and 200 test images with line-level annotations.

7. **TextOCR**: A large and diverse OCR dataset consisting of 28,134 images and 903,000 annotated words.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
