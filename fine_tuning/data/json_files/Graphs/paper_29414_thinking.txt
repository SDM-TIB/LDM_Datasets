To extract datasets from the research paper titled "All-optical graph representation learning using integrated diffractive photonic computing units" by Tao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is demonstrated using benchmark databases for node and graph-level classification tasks. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results** or **methods** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention three benchmark datasets used for evaluation: **Cora-ML**, **Citeseer**, and **Amazon Photo**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, which further confirms their relevance. I will also check the **methods section** to see if there are any additional details about how these datasets were processed or utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **Cora-ML Dataset**: The citation is:
   > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Inform. Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sen, P., et al. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Mag.*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **Amazon Photo Dataset**: The citation is:
   > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proc. 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, 43-52.

After collecting all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
