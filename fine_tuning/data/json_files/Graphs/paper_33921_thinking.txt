To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Robust RF Device Fingerprinting Under Time-Domain Shift" by Jun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of RF device fingerprinting and mentions experiments conducted on wireless and wired RF datasets, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific dataset names or descriptions. The introduction discusses the challenges of domain shift in RF fingerprinting but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **Methodology** section, particularly the **Dataset Construction** subsection. Here, the authors describe the dataset collection process in detail. They mention using real RF datasets collected from an experimental testbed with 15+ PyCom/IoT transmitting devices. They also describe the data collection scenarios (Wireless-WiFi and Wired-WiFi) and how the datasets are structured into Capture Sets.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Wireless-WiFi Dataset**: This dataset consists of RF signals captured wirelessly from devices located 1 meter away from the receiver. It includes multiple Capture Sets created from the transmissions of the devices.

2. **Wired-WiFi Dataset**: This dataset consists of RF signals captured from devices connected directly to the receiver via an SMA cable, allowing for a controlled environment to mask the impact of the wireless channel. Similar to the Wireless-WiFi dataset, it includes multiple Capture Sets.

The authors also mention that they created S datasets (Capture Sets) from the transmissions of the devices, which consist of portions of the tested devicesâ€™ transmissions captured at the same offset in time.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (Wireless-WiFi and Wired-WiFi) do not have specific citations as they are original datasets created by the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names and descriptions, along with any relevant citations for the methodologies or related works that support the dataset creation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details and citations as required.
