To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-Granularity Contrastive Learning for Post-Training in Few-Shot Scene" by Ruikun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their approach and empirical results, which may include specific datasets they used for training and evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their model on the **GLUE benchmark**. This is a well-known dataset in the NLP community, specifically designed for evaluating natural language understanding tasks. I will note this as a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GLUE benchmark. The citation for the GLUE benchmark is as follows:
> Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP, pages 353â€“355, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to compile the information in a clear and structured manner, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or references in the methodology/experiments sections.
3. Identify the GLUE benchmark as a primary dataset used in the experiments.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the GLUE benchmark from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information clearly, ensuring to include full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
