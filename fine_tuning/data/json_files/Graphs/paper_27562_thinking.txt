To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pyramidal Reservoir Graph Neural Network" by Filippo Maria Bianchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide information about the datasets used in the research. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on a "large set of graph datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention two new datasets introduced for graph classification, referred to as **B-easy** and **B-hard**. The authors describe these datasets as consisting of graphs constructed from random clusters of points, with specific characteristics that make them suitable for testing graph classification algorithms.

In addition to the new datasets, the authors also reference several well-known benchmark datasets for graph classification in **section 6.2**. These include:

1. **Mutagenicity Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the mutagenic effect of chemical compounds.
2. **Proteins Dataset**: A dataset containing protein structures represented as graphs.
3. **Enzymes Dataset**: A dataset of enzyme structures for classification tasks.
4. **NCI1 Dataset**: A dataset from the National Cancer Institute for chemical compound classification.
5. **D&D Dataset**: A dataset representing protein-protein interactions.
6. **IMDB-BINARY Dataset**: A dataset of social networks for binary classification.
7. **IMDB-MULTI Dataset**: A dataset of social networks for multi-class classification.
8. **COLLAB Dataset**: A dataset representing collaboration networks.
9. **Reddit-2K Dataset**: A dataset of Reddit posts for classification tasks.
10. **Reddit-5K Dataset**: A larger version of the Reddit dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the new datasets (B-easy and B-hard) may not be available in the references since they are introduced in this paper, but I will ensure to note that they are available online as indicated in the text.

For the benchmark datasets, I will look for their respective citations, which are likely to be included in the references. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset, especially for the benchmark datasets, as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
