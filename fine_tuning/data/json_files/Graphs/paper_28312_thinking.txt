To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VPN: Video Provenance Network for Robust Content Attribution" by Alexander Black et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it hints at the use of a dataset for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **VGGSound**: This dataset is characterized as a large audio dataset containing 160,000 training videos and 14,000 test videos, with each video being 10 seconds long and covering 310 audio classes. The authors note that they used the public VGGSound train set for training without class annotations and created a test set for retrieval from the 14,000 test videos.

2. **DFDC-Preview**: This dataset consists of 5,000 original and manipulated videos, all 15 seconds long, with a public train/test split. The authors used this dataset to evaluate their model's generalization to new domains and unseen transformations.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VGGSound**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H., Xie, W., Vedaldi, A., & Zisserman, A. (2020). VGG-Sound: A large scale audio-visual dataset. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

- For **DFDC-Preview**, the citation is:
  > Dolhansky, B., Bitton, J., Pflaum, B., Lu, J., Howes, R., Wang, M., & Ferrer, C. C. (2020). The DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) Dataset. CoRR abs/2006.07397.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
