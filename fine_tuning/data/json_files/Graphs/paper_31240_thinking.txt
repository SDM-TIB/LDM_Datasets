To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-Augmented (cid:96)0 Regularization of Tensor Regression with Tucker Decomposition" by Tian Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of the NA0CT2 method and mentions its application in both simulation studies and real data applications, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Numerical Examples)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they mention using simulated data for three different types of responses (Gaussian, binary, and count) and a real dataset for their analysis.

In **subsection 4.1 (Simulation Studies)**, the authors describe the simulated datasets used for their experiments. They mention generating data from specific distributions for each response type, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation since these are synthetic datasets created for the study.

In **subsection 4.2 (Real Data Application)**, the authors refer to the **FG-NET dataset**, which is a real dataset used for age prediction based on human face images. They provide a brief description of the dataset, including the number of images and the annotations available.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the FG-NET dataset from the references section of the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Yanwei Fu, Timothy M. Hospedales, Tao Xiang, Yuan Yao, and Shaogang Gong. *Interestingness prediction by robust learning to rank*. In ECCV, 2014.

Since the simulated datasets do not have formal citations, I will only document the FG-NET dataset with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly identifies the datasets used in the research, ensuring that the citation for the FG-NET dataset is included.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the numerical examples section for details on datasets used.
3. Identify the FG-NET dataset and retrieve its citation from the references.
4. Document the findings clearly, focusing on the FG-NET dataset citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the relevant datasets from the research paper.
