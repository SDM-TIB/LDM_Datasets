To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Big Self-Supervised Models Advance Medical Image Classifications" by Shekoofeh Azizi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions two distinct tasks: dermatology condition classification and multi-label chest X-ray classification, which suggests that there are specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Tasks and datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Dermatology Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a tele-dermatology service and includes images of skin conditions from 12,306 unique patients. The final dataset used for training and testing consists of 15,340 cases, with a total of 27 unique classes for skin conditions.

2. **CheXpert Dataset**: This is a large open-source dataset containing 224,316 chest radiographs from 65,240 unique patients. The dataset includes labels for 14 radiological observations, and the authors mention using a custom split for training and validation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Dermatology Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Jain, A., Eng, C., Way, D. H., Lee, K., Bui, P., Kanada, K., Marinho, G. O., Gallegos, J., Gabriele, S., et al. (2020). A deep learning system for differential diagnosis of skin diseases. *Nature Medicine*, 26(6), 900-908.

- For the **CheXpert Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., Haghgoo, B., Ball, R., Shpanskaya, K., et al. (2019). CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, 33, 590-597.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
