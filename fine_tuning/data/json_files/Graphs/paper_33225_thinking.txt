To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaptSSR: Pre-training User Model with Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Ranking" by Yang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on both public and industrial datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss user modeling and the challenges related to data sparsity, hinting at the need for datasets but not naming any specific ones yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Tencent Transfer Learning (TTL) dataset**: This dataset contains users' recent 100 interactions on the QQ Browser platform and is used for various user profiling tasks. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of behavior sequences and different behaviors.

2. **App dataset**: This dataset consists of users' app installation behaviors collected by OPPO from December 2022 to March 2023. It also includes downstream labeled data for tasks such as gender prediction and CVR prediction.

In this section, the authors provide detailed statistics about each dataset, which confirms their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The TTL dataset citation is attributed to Yuan et al. (2020), and the App dataset is mentioned as being collected by OPPO, but it may not have a formal citation since it is proprietary data.

The full citation for the **TTL dataset** is:
> Yuan, F., He, X., Karatzoglou, A., & Zhang, L. (2020). Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation. In Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 1469â€“1478.

For the **App dataset**, since it is proprietary and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is collected by OPPO and provide the context in which it is mentioned.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation where applicable.
