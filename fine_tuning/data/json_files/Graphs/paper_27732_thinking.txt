To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Integrated Deep Learning and Dynamic Programming Method for Predicting Tumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Fusion from PDB Structures" by N. Anandanadarajah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validated their method using the **COSMIC online database**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. In the data preprocessing section, the authors describe how they extracted annotated cancer genes from the **COSMIC v88** database, which includes 141 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), 80 oncogenes (OGs), and 94 fusion genes. This provides a clear indication of the datasets used in their study.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for training and testing. The authors mention that they used a total of **2108 PDB files** belonging to **138 genes** for their experiments, with a breakdown of **1574 PDB files** for training and **545 PDB files** for testing.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **COSMIC Database**: The citation for the COSMIC database is:
   > S. Bamford et al., "The COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database and website," *Br. J. Cancer*, vol. 91, no. 2, pp. 355–358, Jul. 2004, doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601894.

2. **PDB Files**: The citation for the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is:
   > H. M. Berman et al., "The Protein Data Bank," *Nucleic Acids Res.*, vol. 28, no. 1, pp. 235–242, Jan. 2000, doi: 10.1093/nar/28.1.235.

3. **COSMIC v88**: The specific version of the COSMIC database used is:
   > Z. Sondka et al., "The COSMIC Cancer Gene Census: describing genetic dysfunction across all human cancers," *Nat. Rev. Cancer*, vol. 18, no. 11, pp. 696–705, Nov. 2018, doi: 10.1038/s41568-018-0060-1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the research, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited for reference. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the study and their significance in the context of the research.
