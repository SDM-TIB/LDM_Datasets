To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIOSCAN-5M: A Multimodal Dataset for Insect Biodiversity" by Zahra Gharaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper presents the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, which is a comprehensive dataset containing multimodal information for over 5 million insect specimens. This indicates that the BIOSCAN-5M dataset is the primary focus.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **Methods** or **Dataset** section. In this case, the paper provides a detailed description of the BIOSCAN-5M dataset in **section 3 (Dataset)**. Here, I will note the key features of the dataset, such as the number of specimens, types of data included (e.g., images, DNA barcodes, taxonomic labels), and any relevant statistics.

The paper mentions that the BIOSCAN-5M dataset is derived from the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for both the BIOSCAN-5M dataset and the BIOSCAN-1M dataset.

The full citation for the BIOSCAN-5M dataset is:
> Gharaee, Z., Lowe, S. C., Gong, Z., Millan Arias, P., Pellegrino, N., Wang, A. T., Haurum, J. B., Zarubiieva, I., Kari, L., Steinke, D., Taylor, G. W., & Fieguth, P. (2024). BIOSCAN-5M: A Multimodal Dataset for Insect Biodiversity. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.17537*.

The full citation for the BIOSCAN-1M dataset is:
> Gharaee, Z., Gong, Z., Pellegrino, N., Zarubiieva, I., Haurum, J. B., Lowe, S. C., McKeown, J. T. A., Ho, C. C. Y., McLeod, J., Wei, Y.-Y. C., Agda, J., Ratnasingham, S., Steinke, D., Chang, A. X., Taylor, G. W., & Fieguth, P. (2023). A step towards worldwide biodiversity assessment: The BIOSCAN-1M insect dataset. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (Vol. 36, pp. 43593â€“43619).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the number of specimens, types of data, and any unique features that may be relevant for future research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
