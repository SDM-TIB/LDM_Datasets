To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Similarity among Users for Personalized Session-Based Recommendation from hierarchical structure of User-Session-Item" by Haemin Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for validation. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **TV Watching Dataset**: This dataset consists of data from 300 viewers over a six-month period based on TV viewing records. It includes user interactions defined as watching a program, with sessions being sequences of program viewing records. The authors note that sessions were divided based on a 180-second interval, and they filtered out TV programs that appeared less than five times.

2. **AppUsage Dataset**: This dataset contains application usage history data for iPhone users. Similar to the TV Watching dataset, user interactions are defined as app usage, and sessions are sequences of app usage records. The authors mention that system default apps were removed from the training or testing steps.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper indicates that the TV Watching dataset is private and will not be publicly released, which means I will not be able to provide a citation for it. For the AppUsage dataset, the authors reference a specific study:

- For the **AppUsage Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clayton Shepard, Ahmad Rahmati, Chad Tossell, Lin Zhong, and Phillip Kortum. *LiveLab: measuring wireless networks and smartphone users in the field*. ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review 38, 3 (2011), 15â€“20.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the AppUsage dataset while noting the private status of the TV Watching dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the descriptions.
