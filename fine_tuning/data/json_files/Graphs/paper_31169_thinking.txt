To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShapeWordNet: An Interpretable Shapelet Neural Network for Physiological Signal Classification" by Wenqiang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions the datasets used for experiments. In this case, it states that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on three public datasets from PhysioNet, specifically for physiological signal classification tasks. 

I will look for a **table or a list** that summarizes the datasets, as this is a common way to present such information. In this case, the paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, including the training and testing sizes, dimensions, and categories.

The three datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **CPSC (China Physiological Signal Challenge)**: 
   - Training Size: 5,123
   - Test Size: 1,268
   - Dimensions/Length: 12/5,000
   - Category: ECG

2. **Georgia**: 
   - Training Size: 2,676
   - Test Size: 668
   - Dimensions/Length: 12/5,000
   - Category: ECG

3. **Sleep**: 
   - Training Size: 12,787
   - Test Size: 1,421
   - Dimensions/Length: 2/3,000
   - Category: EEG

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following references related to the datasets:

- For the **CPSC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alday, E.A.P., Gu, A., Shah, A.J., Robichaux, C., Wong, A.K.I., Liu, C., Liu, F., Rad, A.B., Elola, A., Seyedi, S., et al. "Classification of 12-lead ecgs: the physionet/computing in cardiology challenge 2020." *Physiological Measurement* 41(12), 124003, 2020.

- For the **Georgia dataset**, it is part of the same reference as CPSC, as both datasets are used in the same challenge.

- For the **Sleep dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kemp, B., Zwinderman, A., Tuk, B., Kamphuisen, H., Oberye, J. "Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG." *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering* 47(9), 1185â€“1194, 2000.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
