To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward high-performance online HCCR: a CNN approach with DropDistortion, path signature and spatial stochastic max-pooling" by Songxuan Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they conducted experiments on three publicly available datasets: **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.0**, **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.1**, and the **ICDAR2013 online HCCR competition dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** section for more details about these datasets. The introduction emphasizes the importance of large-scale datasets for improving performance in online handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR). It also mentions that the experiments were carried out on the aforementioned datasets, confirming their relevance.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.0**: This dataset contains 3740 Chinese character classes from the standard level-1 set of GB2312-80, obtained from 420 writers. It includes 336 samples for training and 84 samples for testing per character class.

2. **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.1**: Similar to the previous dataset, this one contains 3755 classes in GB1, obtained from 300 writers, with 240 samples for training and 60 samples for testing per character class.

3. **ICDAR2013 online HCCR competition dataset**: This dataset consists of three datasets containing isolated Chinese characters, specifically designed for the ICDAR2013 competition.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.0** and **CASIA-OLHWDB 1.1**, the citation is:
  > Liu, C.L., Yin, F., Wang, D.H., Wang, Q.F. (2011). *CASIA online and offline Chinese handwriting databases*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 37–41.

- For **ICDAR2013 online HCCR competition dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yin, F., Wang, Q.F., Zhang, X.Y., Liu, C.L. (2013). *ICDAR 2013 Chinese handwriting recognition competition*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 1464–1470.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
