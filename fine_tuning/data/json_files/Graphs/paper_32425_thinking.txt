To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Contrastive Learning with Multiple Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation" by Dongjun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four real-world datasets: **Beauty, Sports, Toys, and Yelp**. I will take note of the statistics provided for each dataset, such as the number of users, items, interactions, average length, and sparsity.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets were collected from real-world platforms, specifically Amazon for Beauty, Sports, and Toys, and Yelp for the Yelp dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, so I will need to look for authoritative sources or original papers that describe these datasets.

For the **Beauty dataset**, I will reference:
> McAuley, J., & Leskovec, J. (2013). *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems (RecSys '13), 165-172. https://doi.org/10.1145/2507157.2507160.

For the **Yelp dataset**, I will reference:
> Yelp Dataset Challenge. (2020). *Yelp Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

For the **Sports and Toys datasets**, since they are also from Amazon, I will use the same reference as for the Beauty dataset, as they are part of the same collection of datasets used for recommendation systems.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
