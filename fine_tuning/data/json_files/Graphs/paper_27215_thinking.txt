To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Node2Seq: Towards Trainable Convolutions in Graph Neural Networks" by Hao Yuan and Shuiwang Ji, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not list datasets explicitly. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Studies)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset where nodes represent academic papers and edges denote citation relationships.
2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset also consists of academic papers and their citation links.
3. **Amazon Photo**: A co-purchase dataset where nodes represent products and edges indicate products frequently bought together.
4. **Actor**: A co-occurrence dataset where nodes represent actors and edges indicate co-occurrences on Wikipedia pages.
5. **Chameleon** and **Squirrel**: Wikipedia network datasets where nodes represent Wikipedia pages and edges represent mutual links between them.

In this section, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset, including the types of nodes and edges, which is crucial for understanding their application in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Amazon Photo**:

- **Actor**:

- **Chameleon**:

- **Squirrel**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
