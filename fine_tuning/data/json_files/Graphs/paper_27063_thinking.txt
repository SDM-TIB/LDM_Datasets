To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-range medical image registration through generalized mutual information (GMI): toward a fully automatic volumetric alignment" by Vinicius Pavanelli Vianna and Luiz Otavio Murta Jr., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using T1 and T2 MRI images, which suggests that these images may be part of a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. The introduction mentions the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the NAMIC Registration Library, indicating that these may be the sources of the datasets used in the study.

In the **Materials and Methods** section, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors specify that they selected MRI images from two databases: the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the NAMIC Registration Library. They provide specific details about the images used, including the subjects and the types of images (T1 and T2).

I will also check the **Results** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments and to gather any additional context about their application.

Finally, I will consult the **References** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution.

The datasets identified are:

1. **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**: The authors used pre-processed structural MRI images from the HCP, specifically from subjects numbered 172635 and 211821.

2. **NAMIC Registration Library**: The authors also used images from the NAMIC Registration Library, specifically Case 192, which includes T1 and T2 images from healthy volunteers.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
