Each image is annotated with oriented bounding boxes for five categories (car, bus, truck, van, and freight car), totaling 953,087 instances. The scenes range from daytime to nighttime, including roads, urban areas, and parking lots. The dataset is officially divided into training, validation, and test sets with 17,990, 1,469, and 8,980 image pairs, respectively.",
