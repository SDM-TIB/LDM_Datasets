To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compound Figure Separation of Biomedical Images: Mining Large Datasets for Self-supervised Learning" by Tianyuan Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large-scale images for training AI models in medical image analysis. They mention the need for compound figure separation and refer to the **ImageCLEF 2016 dataset** as a widely used testbed for such tasks.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention two in-house datasets: 

1. **Glomeruli-2000 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 917 training and 917 testing real figure plots from the American Journal of Kidney Diseases (AJKD), annotated with four classes of glomeruli images.

2. **Web-mined Glomerular Dataset**: This dataset includes 20,000 images obtained from various online resources, which were used for training the SimCFS model.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database** as a publicly available dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database**, the citation is:
  > Alba Garc´ıa Seco de Herrera, Roger Schaer, Stefano Bromuri, and Henning M¨uller. *Overview of the ImageCLEF 2016 medical task*. In Working Notes of CLEF 2016 (Cross Language Evaluation Forum), September 2016.

- For the **Glomeruli-2000 Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note it as part of the paper's contributions.

- For the **Web-mined Glomerular Dataset**, it is also an in-house dataset and may not have a formal citation, but I will document it as well.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I provide accurate references for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will help in maintaining the integrity of the research and facilitate further studies that may rely on these datasets.
