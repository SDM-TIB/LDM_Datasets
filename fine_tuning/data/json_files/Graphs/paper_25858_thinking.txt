To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Cross-lingual Knowledge Alignment" by Muhao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a model (MTransE) for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to knowledge graphs may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they are used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two primary datasets used in their experiments:

1. **WK3l-15k**: This dataset consists of English, French, and German knowledge graphs under the DBpedia’s dbo: Person domain. It contains 203,502 English triples, 170,605 French triples, and 145,616 German triples, with a total of 16,470 aligned triples between English and French, and 37,170 aligned triples between English and German.

2. **WK3l-120k**: This is a larger version of the WK3l dataset, containing 1,376,011 English triples, 767,750 French triples, and 391,108 German triples, with 124,433 aligned triples between English and French, and 69,413 aligned triples between English and German.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset, **CN3l**, derived from ConceptNet, which is also used for evaluation. This dataset has its own statistics, including the number of triples and inter-lingual links.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **WK3l**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Muhao, Yingtao Tian, Mohan Yang, and Carlo Zaniolo. "Multilingual Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Cross-lingual Knowledge Alignment." arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03954, 2017.

- For **ConceptNet**, the citation is:
  > Speer, Robert, and Catherine Havasi. "ConceptNet 5: A large semantic network for relational knowledge." In The People’s Web Meets NLP, pages 161–176, 2013.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted information effectively for further use.
