To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree based Progressive Regression Model for Watch-Time Prediction in Short-video Recommendation" by Xiaokai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive offline evaluations have been conducted in public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Kuaishou Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the Kuaishou App and includes 7,176 users, 10,728 items, and 12,530,806 impressions. This dataset is crucial for the offline experiments.

2. **CIKM16 Dataset**: This dataset is from the CIKM16 Cup and aims to predict the dwell time for each session in online search results. It contains 310,302 sessions and 122,991 items, with an average session length of 3.981.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Kuaishou Dataset**, since it is collected from the Kuaishou App, I will note that it may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as:
  > Kuaishou Dataset. Collected from Kuaishou App. Available at: https://kuairec.com/

- For the **CIKM16 Dataset**, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset. The citation is:
  > CIKM16 Cup. *CIKM 2016 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management*. Available at: [CIKM16 website or proceedings link].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations to ensure clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
