To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Covariance Descriptors for Facial Expression Recognition" by Naima Otberdout et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to:

1. **Oulu-CASIA dataset**: This dataset includes 480 image sequences of 80 subjects, with each subject providing six sequences corresponding to six basic emotions. The authors mention that they used the last three peak frames for training and testing, resulting in 1440 images.

2. **Static Facial Expression in the Wild (SFEW) dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,322 static images labeled with seven facial expressions. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with the authors using the training and validation data for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Oulu-CASIA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guoying Zhao, Xiaohua Huang, Matti Taini, Stan Z Li, and Matti Pietikäinen. *Facial expression recognition from near-infrared videos*. Image and Vision Computing, 29(9):607–619, 2011.

- For the **SFEW dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abhinav Dhall, OV Ramana Murthy, Roland Goecke, Jyoti Joshi, and Tom Gedeon. *Video and image based emotion recognition challenges in the wild: Emotiw 2015*. In ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pages 423–426. ACM, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
