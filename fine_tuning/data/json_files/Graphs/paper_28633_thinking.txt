To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimCLAD: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Acronym Disambiguation" by Bin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the acronym disambiguation task and its importance in scientific document understanding, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to look for more detailed information in the later sections.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** of the paper, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used. Here, the authors mention a dataset for acronym disambiguation in the scientific English domain, providing statistical information about the dataset's composition:

- **Scientific English Dataset**: This dataset is divided into three parts: a training set with 7,532 samples, a development set with 894 samples, and a test set with 574 samples, totaling 9,000 samples. The authors indicate that the training and validation sets have been manually labeled.

The authors also reference the dataset in the context of their experiments, confirming its use for evaluating their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is attributed to the work of Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh et al. (2022a), which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh, S. Y. R. J. F. D. T. H. N., Nicole Meister. 2022a. MACRONYM: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multilingual and Multi-Domain Acronym Extraction. In arXiv.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
