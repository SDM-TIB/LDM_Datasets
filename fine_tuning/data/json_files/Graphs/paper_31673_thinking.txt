To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Attention Network for Sequential Recommendation" by Huanhuan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **four widely used benchmark datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some statistics about each:

1. **Beauty Dataset**: A subset of the Amazon Product dataset with 22,363 users, 12,101 items, and 198,502 actions.
2. **Clothing Dataset**: Another subset of the Amazon Product dataset with 39,387 users, 23,033 items, and 278,677 actions.
3. **Sports Dataset**: A third subset of the Amazon Product dataset with 35,598 users, 18,357 items, and 296,337 actions.
4. **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: A well-known dataset with 6,041 users, 3,417 items, and 999,611 actions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Amazon Product dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Growth of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897–908, 2013.

- For the **MovieLens-1M dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1–19, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
