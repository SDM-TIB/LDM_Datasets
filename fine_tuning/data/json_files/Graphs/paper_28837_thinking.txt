To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Informative Graph Augmentation via A Meta Learning Approach" by Hang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on twelve benchmark datasets categorized into two groups: Social Networks and Molecules. The specific datasets listed are:

1. **RDT-M5K**: A social network dataset.
2. **IMDB-B**: Another social network dataset.
3. **IMDB-M**: A third social network dataset.
4. **PROTEINS**: A molecular dataset.
5. **MUTAG**: A molecular dataset.
6. **COLLAB**: A molecular dataset.
7. **DD**: A molecular dataset.
8. **molesol**: A molecular dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).
9. **mollipo**: Another molecular dataset from OGB.
10. **molbbbp**: A molecular dataset from OGB.
11. **moltox21**: A molecular dataset from OGB.
12. **molsider**: A molecular dataset from OGB.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide accurate citations. The authors reference the following sources for the datasets:

- For **RDT-M5K**, **IMDB-B**, **IMDB-M**, **PROTEINS**, **MUTAG**, **COLLAB**, and **DD**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Morris, Nils M Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *Tudataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond.

- For the datasets from the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and ready for further use or analysis.
