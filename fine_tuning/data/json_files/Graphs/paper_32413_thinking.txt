To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep Lead Optimization Enveloped in Protein Pocket through Unified Deleting Strategies and a Structure-aware Network" by Haotian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce their model, Delete, and mention that it has been trained on two datasets, which is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, specifically the **Dataset Construction** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention:

1. **CrossDock**: This dataset is described as a recognized benchmark for existing pocket-aware 3D de novo design models, curated from molecular cross-docking results. It contains 100,000 training pocket-ligand pairs.

2. **BindingMoad**: This dataset consists of all crystal structures and is used as an evaluation choice for the model. It contains 35,516 training pairs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CrossDock**, the citation is:
  > Francoeur, P. G. et al. *Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 60, 4200-4215, 2020.

- For **BindingMoad**, the citation is:
  > Hu, L., Benson, M. L., Smith, R. D., Lerner, M. G. & Carlson, H. A. *Binding MOAD (mother of all databases)*. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 60, 333-340, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
