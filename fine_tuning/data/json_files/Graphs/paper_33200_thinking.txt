To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning force-field models for metallic spin glass" by Menglin Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the machine learning models.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments and the data generation process. In this section, they mention that they generated datasets through exact diagonalization (ED) and ED-LLG simulations on a system consisting of 100 atoms with various configurations. This indicates that there are datasets related to the atomic configurations and the corresponding spin states.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific details about the datasets used for training their machine learning models. They mention that the size of the effective datasets is 250 * 100 = 25,000 data points, which is crucial information for understanding the scale of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or models that are referenced in the paper. This may include citations for the original models or datasets used in their experiments.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Dataset from Exact Diagonalization (ED)**: This dataset is generated from the exact diagonalization of the random s-d model for various spin configurations. The authors mention that they used 10 different realizations of random atomic configurations, leading to a total of 250 different spin configurations.

2. **Dataset from ED-LLG Simulations**: This dataset is used to benchmark the machine learning model against the exact diagonalization results. It includes the local fields and energies computed from the simulations.

Now, I will write down the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Exact Diagonalization (ED)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Menglin Shi, Sheng Zhang, and Gia-Wei Chern. *Machine learning force-field models for metallic spin glass*. arXiv:2311.00001 [cond-mat.stat-mech], 2023.

- For the **ED-LLG Simulations** dataset, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same study.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented each dataset clearly, including their descriptions and citations, to facilitate further analysis or use in future research.
