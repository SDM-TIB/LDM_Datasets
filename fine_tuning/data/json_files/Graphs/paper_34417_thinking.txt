To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing E-commerce Search: Toward a Generalizable and Rank-Consistent Pre-Ranking Model" by Enqiang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their training dataset. They mention that it is compiled from **15 days of search logs**, amounting to approximately **one billion records**. Each record is annotated with multiple binary encoded labels indicating whether an item is clicked and ordered. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used for their experiments.

Since the dataset is derived from internal search logs, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document it as it is crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any datasets mentioned that are publicly available or widely recognized. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and models rather than specific datasets. 

In this case, I will summarize the dataset extracted from the paper as follows:

1. **Search Logs Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately one billion records compiled from 15 days of search logs, with each record annotated for click and conversion labels.

Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset from JD.com and does not have a publicly available reference.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the details of the dataset and its context within the research.

After completing this process, I will have a clear understanding of the datasets used in the paper and their significance in the research findings.
