To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COV19IR: COVID-19 Domain Literature Information Retrieval" by Arusarka Bose et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **CORD-19 dataset** for implementing their solutions, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **preliminary** section where the authors discuss the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)** in detail. They describe it as a resource containing over 200,000 scholarly articles related to COVID-19, which confirms its significance in their work.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the CORD-19 dataset's application in their experiments. However, it appears that the focus remains on the CORD-19 dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CORD-19 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Lucy Lu Wang, Kyle Lo, Yoganand Chandrasekhar, Russell Reas, Jiangjiang Yang, Doug Burdick, Darrin Eide, Kathryn Funk, Yannis Katsis, Rodney Kinney, Yunyao Li, Ziyang Liu, William Merrill, Paul Mooney, Dewey Murdick, Devvret Rishi, Jerry Sheehan, Zhihong Shen, Brandon Stilson, Alex Wade, Kuansan Wang, Nancy Xin Ru Wang, Chris Wilhelm, Boya Xie, Douglas Raymond, Daniel S. Weld, Oren Etzioni, and Sebastian Kohlmeier. *CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset*. In: (2020). arXiv: 2004.10706 [cs.DL].

Since the CORD-19 dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will create an entry for it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
