To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Radio technologies for environment-aware wireless communications" by TomaÅ¾ Javornik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss wireless technologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on channel state information (CSI) and its applications, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses various wireless communication systems and their capabilities but does not mention specific datasets.

I will then look into the **subsequent sections** that detail different wireless technologies, such as GSM, UMTS, LTE, and NR. These sections may contain references to datasets used for evaluating the performance of these technologies. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and does not explicitly mention datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. This could include datasets used in previous studies that the authors reference.

If I find any datasets mentioned in the text or references, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if a dataset is referenced in the context of a specific wireless technology, I will note the details and provide the citation as follows:

- If a dataset related to the GSM system is mentioned, I would look for its citation in the references, such as:
  > Redl, S., Weber, M., & Oliphant, M. (1995). *An Introduction to GSM*. Artech House.

- Similarly, for datasets related to IEEE standards or other technologies, I will extract the relevant citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

In summary, my approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and relevant sections for dataset mentions.
2. Checking the references for any datasets cited indirectly.
3. Documenting any identified datasets with their full citations.
4. Compiling the information for clarity and future use.
