To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mew: Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Image Analysis through an Efficient Multiplex Network" by Sukwon Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on a "real-world patient dataset from various institutions," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, particularly focusing on **section 4.1 (Patient-level Phenotype Prediction)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **UPMC-HNC Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples from patients diagnosed with head-and-neck cancer, specifically mentioning that it includes 658 sample images from 139 patients.

2. **Stanford-CRC Dataset**: This dataset includes samples from patients with colorectal cancer, with a total of 292 images.

3. **DFCI-HNC Dataset**: This dataset is used for generalization tasks and includes images from patients diagnosed with head-and-neck cancer.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they split the datasets for training, validation, and testing, which further confirms the datasets' relevance and usage in their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or institutional datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are derived from institutions like the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Stanford University, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI).

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **UPMC-HNC Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset containing 658 sample images from 139 patients diagnosed with head-and-neck cancer.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; derived from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

2. **Stanford-CRC Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 292 images from patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; derived from Stanford University.

3. **DFCI-HNC Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset used for generalization tasks, including images from patients diagnosed with head-and-neck cancer.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; derived from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or documentation needs.
