To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating writing style as a contributor to gender gaps in science and technology" by Ekaterina Levitskaya, Kara Kedrick, and Russell J. Funk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on writing styles and gender gaps, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will check the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their data sources. They mention using two distinct corpora: **Web of Science (WoS) data** and **PatentsView data**. This indicates that these are the primary datasets utilized in their research.

In the **data and methods section**, the authors provide details about how they constructed their samples from these datasets. They specifically mention that they focused on solo-authored papers and patents, which helps clarify the nature of the data they are working with.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are databases rather than standalone publications. However, I can cite the databases as follows:

1. **Web of Science (WoS)**: 
   > Clarivate Analytics. *Web of Science*. Available at: https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/

2. **PatentsView**: 
   > United States Patent and Trademark Office. *PatentsView*. Available at: http://www.patentsview.org/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
