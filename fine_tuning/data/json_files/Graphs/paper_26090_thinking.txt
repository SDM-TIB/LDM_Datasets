To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inferring JavaScript Types Using Graph Neural Networks" by Kai Wohlfahrt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors implemented a model using a dataset of JavaScript source files gathered from GitHub, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Data and Code Representation)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of JavaScript source files collected from GitHub, with specific details about the number of files and repositories:

1. **Training Set**: Includes 10,268 files from 660 repositories and 578 organizations.
2. **Testing Set**: Includes 3,539 files from 136 repositories and 127 organizations.

This section provides a clear description of the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from GitHub and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that the dataset is based on JavaScript source files from GitHub without a specific publication reference.

To summarize the dataset extraction:

- **Dataset Name**: JavaScript Source Files Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of JavaScript source files gathered from GitHub, with a training set of 10,268 files from 660 repositories and a testing set of 3,539 files from 136 repositories.
- **Citation**: No formal citation available; dataset derived from GitHub.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and any relevant citations.
