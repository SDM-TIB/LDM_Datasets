To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAIT: Benchmarking (Embedding) Architectures for Interactive Theorem-Proving" by Sean Lamont et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework BAIT and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks and datasets related to Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP). 

I will specifically look for sections that detail the datasets, such as "Benchmarks and Approaches in AI-ITP" and "Supervised Setting." Here, I find references to multiple datasets:

1. **HOLStep**: A dataset for premise selection in higher-order logic theorem proving.
2. **MIZAR40**: Another dataset used for premise selection, specifically for the Mizar formal proof assistant.
3. **LeanStep**: A dataset that includes various tasks for the Lean theorem prover.
4. **HOList**: A dataset that contains premise and tactic selection data in HOL Light.

In the **conclusion and future work sections**, the authors mention the need for more datasets, which reinforces the importance of the datasets already discussed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **HOLStep**, the citation is:
  > Kaliszyk, C., Chollet, F., & Szegedy, C. (2017). HolStep: A Machine Learning Dataset for Higher-order Logic Theorem Proving. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- For **MIZAR40**, the citation is:
  > Kaliszyk, C., & Urban, J. (2015). MizAR 40 for Mizar 40. Journal of Automated Reasoning, 55(3), 245–256.

- For **LeanStep**, the citation is:
  > Han, J. M., Rute, J., Wu, Y., Ayers, E., & Polu, S. (2022). Proof Artifact Co-Training for Theorem Proving with Language Models. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- For **HOList**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
