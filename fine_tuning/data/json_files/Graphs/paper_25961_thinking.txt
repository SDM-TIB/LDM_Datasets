To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Structure-Aware Convolutional Networks for Knowledge Base Completion" by Chao Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed model on standard datasets, specifically **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly the **benchmark datasets** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is derived from Freebase and contains knowledge base relation triples and textual mentions of Freebase entity pairs. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is created from WN18, which is a subset of WordNet. The authors explain that WN18RR was designed to avoid inverse relation test leakage, and they provide a citation for the original WN18 dataset.

3. **FB15k-237-Attr**: This dataset is constructed by extracting attribute triples from the FB24k dataset. The authors describe how they derived this dataset and mention the original FB24k dataset, which is also important for citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., and Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, 57–66.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., and Riedel, S. (2017). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01476.

- For **FB24k**, the citation is:
  > Lin, Y., Liu, Z., and Sun, M. (2016). Knowledge representation learning with entities, attributes and relations. In Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, 41–52.

- For **FB15k-237-Attr**, since it is derived from FB15k-237 and FB24k, I will reference it as a combination of the two datasets, but I will note that it is a new dataset created for this study.

After collecting all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
