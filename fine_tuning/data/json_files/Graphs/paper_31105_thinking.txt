To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GaitSADA: Self-Aligned Domain Adaptation for mmWave Gait Recognition" by Ekkasit Pinyoanuntapong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a non-synthetic dataset was collected for mmWave gait recognition, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (mmWave Gait Biometric Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of gait data collected from 10 volunteers across four different locations, with a total of 2500 samples. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and the data collection process.

In this section, the authors also discuss the specifics of the data collection setup, including the number of samples per participant and the different environments in which the data was collected. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references previous work that may be relevant. However, since the dataset is described as a novel collection for this study, I will note that it is not formally published elsewhere.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **mmWave Gait Biometric Dataset**: This dataset includes gait biometric data collected from 10 volunteers in various environments, totaling 2500 samples.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is part of the research conducted by the authors of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I emphasize the dataset's significance and the context in which it was collected.
