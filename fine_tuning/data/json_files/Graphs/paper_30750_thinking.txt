To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MECCH: Metapath Context Convolution-based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks" by Xinyu Fu and Irwin King, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that "Experiments on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification and link prediction show that MECCH achieves superior prediction accuracy." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but specific names are not provided here.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of heterogeneous graphs but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using five datasets for their experiments: **IMDB**, **ACM**, **DBLP**, **LastFM**, and **PubMed**. This section provides a brief overview of each dataset, including their characteristics and the tasks they are used for.

In **Table 3**, the authors summarize the statistics of these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and the target variable for each dataset. This table will be crucial for extracting detailed information about each dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: 
   > "IMDB is a movie information network for node classification. The preprocessed subset contains three types of nodes: movies, actors, and directors."

2. **ACM Dataset**: 
   > "ACM is an academic network for node classification, with three types of nodes: papers, authors, and subjects."

3. **DBLP Dataset**: 
   > "DBLP is also an academic network for node classification. It contains three types of nodes: papers, authors, and conferences."

4. **LastFM Dataset**: 
   > "LastFM is a music listening information network for link prediction. The preprocessed subset contains three types of nodes: users, artists, and tags."

5. **PubMed Dataset**: 
   > "PubMed is a biomedical knowledge graph for link prediction, with four types of nodes: genes, diseases, chemicals, and species."

Next, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
