To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Similarity Mining for Multimodal Dataset Distillation" by Yue Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of dataset distillation for multimodal data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on **Flickr30k** and **COCO** datasets. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about them.

In **Section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, the authors provide more context about the datasets:
1. **Flickr30k**: This dataset consists of 31,000 images, each paired with five captions. It is commonly used for image captioning tasks.
2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset contains 123,000 images, also paired with five captions per image, and is widely used for various computer vision tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations I find are:
- For **Flickr30k**:
  > Plummer, B. A., Wang, L., Cervantes, C. M., Caicedo, J. C., Hockenmaier, J., & Lazebnik, S. (2015). Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2641–2649.

- For **COCO**:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations accurately.
