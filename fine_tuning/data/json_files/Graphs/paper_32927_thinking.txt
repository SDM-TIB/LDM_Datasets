To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building a Graph-based Deep Learning network model from captured traffic traces" by Carlos GÃ¼emes Palau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions a dataset introduced in the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023, which indicates that there is a specific dataset related to captured traffic traces.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe a dataset formed from 8604 samples, each representing one traffic scenario in the testbed. This is a crucial detail that confirms the existence of a dataset.

I will also check the **evaluation** section to see if there are any additional datasets used for validation or testing. The paper specifies the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing, which provides further context about the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Captured Traffic Traces Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8604 samples, each representing a unique traffic scenario generated in a testbed environment. The dataset is specifically designed for the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023, allowing participants to build models based on real captured data rather than simulated data.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in the context of the challenge, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is associated with the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023.

The citation for the challenge can be referenced as:
> Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023. Available at: [Challenge Website or Repository Link].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset's name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will help in understanding the dataset's relevance and usage in the context of the research presented in the paper.
