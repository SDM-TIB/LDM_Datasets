To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Neural Network Approach for Scalable and Dynamic IP Similarity in Enterprise Networks" by Hazem M. Soliman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of data from an enterprise network, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data. The introduction discusses the challenges of measuring IP similarity and mentions the use of network logs, but does not specify any datasets yet.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training or testing the proposed model. In this section, the authors state that they use a private dataset from a medium-sized enterprise network, which includes network logs from the Bro/Zeek monitoring tool. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, as it is proprietary.

In the **results section**, the authors describe experiments conducted using the private dataset, but again, they do not provide a formal citation. They mention specific IP addresses used in their experiments, such as local DNS servers and root DNS servers, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense.

Since the paper primarily discusses a proprietary dataset without formal citations, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Bro/Zeek monitoring tool, but I cannot provide a full citation as it is not publicly available.

Finally, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper utilizes a **private dataset** from a medium-sized enterprise network, specifically network logs from the Bro/Zeek monitoring tool. However, no formal citation is provided for this dataset.

In conclusion, while I have identified the dataset used in the research, it is important to note that it is proprietary and lacks a formal citation. This is a common scenario in research involving proprietary data, and I will document this accordingly.
