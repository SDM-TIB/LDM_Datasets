To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MGN-Net: a multi-view graph normalizer for integrating heterogeneous biological network populations" by Mustafa Burak Gürbüz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** database, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and materials section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe their evaluation datasets. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **AD/LMCI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 77 subjects, with 41 diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and 36 with Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI). Each subject is represented by 4 cortical morphological brain graphs derived from various measurements.

2. **NC/ASD Dataset**: This dataset includes 310 subjects, with 155 normal controls (NC) and 155 subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It contains 6 cortical morphological brain networks extracted from multiple measurements.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the following:

- For the **ADNI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mueller, S., Weiner, M., Thal, L., Petersen, R., Jack, C., Jagust, W., Trojanowski, J., Toga, A., Beckett, L. (2005). The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. *Neuroimaging Clinics of North America*, 15, 869–877.

- For the **ABIDE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Di Martino, A., Yan, C., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F., Alaerts, K., et al. (2014). The autism brain imaging data exchange: Towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism. *Molecular Psychiatry*, 19, 659–667.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.
