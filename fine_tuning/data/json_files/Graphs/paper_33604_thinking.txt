To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Truck Parking Usage Prediction with Decomposed Graph Neural Networks" by Rei Tamaru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of truck parking and mentions the use of historical parking data, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodological approach** and **experiments** sections. In the **Methodological Approach**, the authors describe the Truck Parking Information Management System (TPIMS) and the TPIMS data archiving system (TPIMS-DAS), which is crucial for understanding the dataset used in their research.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors mention that TPIMS-DAS has archived over 100 million records of truck parking information, which indicates that this dataset is central to their analysis. They also specify that the dataset includes data from 144 parking sites across eight states in the Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials (MAASTO).

Now, I will gather the full citation for the TPIMS dataset. The relevant reference in the **References section** provides the necessary details:

- For the **TPIMS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Cheng, S. Rau, A. Srivastave, S. Li, S. T. Parker, E. Perry, S. S. Ahn, and D. A. Noyce. *Data Archiving and Performance Measurement for a Multi-State Truck Parking Information Management System (TPIMS)*. In Proceedings of the 2023 ASCE International Conference on Transportation and Development, pages 251â€“260, 2023. Available: https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/9780784484876.043

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of records, the states involved, and the types of data collected (e.g., occupancy rates, amenities, etc.).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details and its citation, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
