To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accounting for Work Zone Disruptions in Traffic Flow Forecasting" by Yuanjie Lu, Amarda Shehu, and David Lattanzi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on two datasets capturing traffic flows in the presence of work zones, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Richmond Dataset**: This dataset is derived from in-roadway speed sensor data combined with work zone data provided by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). It includes 95 road segments with data collected from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, at a 15-minute sampling interval, and contains 1896 work zone events.

2. **Tyson’s Dataset**: This dataset is aggregated from the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS) for 131 road segments, with data collected over the same time period but at a 5-minute sampling interval. It includes 1537 construction work zones during the specified time.

The authors also mention that the Richmond dataset is openly available, while the Tyson’s dataset is proprietary and available by direct request.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from specific sources (VDOT for Richmond and RITIS for Tyson’s), I will note that the Richmond dataset is available at a specific URL provided in the paper, while the Tyson’s dataset does not have a formal citation due to its proprietary nature.

The full citation for the Richmond dataset is:
> Richmond area dataset is available from: lrg.gmu.edu/GCNRWZ.

For the Tyson’s dataset, since it is proprietary, I will note:
> Tyson’s Corner dataset is proprietary to the Virginia Department of Transportation and is only available by direct request.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
