To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRCL: Probabilistic Representation Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Haoyu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our PRCL framework." This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention the datasets used for validation. In the paper, they specifically refer to two datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset is noted for containing 1464 well-annotated images in the training set and 1449 images in the validation set. The authors also mention including additional images from the SBD dataset for training.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of 2975 images in the training set and 500 images in the validation set, which is used for semantic urban scene understanding.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
