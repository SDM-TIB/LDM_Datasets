To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards an Interpretable Latent Space in Structured Models for Video Prediction" by Rushil Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain more specific information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of future frame prediction in videos and mention various existing works, but they do not explicitly name any datasets here. I will need to look further into the experiments section for concrete details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two main types of datasets:

1. **Bouncing Shapes**: This dataset includes two variations:
   - **2-BouncingShapes (2-BS)**: A grid environment with two objects (Red Circle and Blue Triangle) moving independently. The dataset consists of 1000 training episodes, 100 validation episodes, and 100 test episodes.
   - **3-BouncingShapes (3-BS)**: Similar to the 2-BS dataset but with three objects (Red Circle, Green Cube, and Blue Triangle). It also includes 1000 training episodes, 100 validation episodes, and 100 test episodes.

2. **Bouncing Shapes with Collision**: This dataset includes:
   - **3-Bouncing Shapes with Collision (3-BSC)**: A variation where objects can collide with each other. It consists of 1000 training episodes, 100 validation episodes, and 100 test episodes.
   - **3-body Physics (3-BP)**: This dataset consists of three balls moving under the effect of gravity and colliding with each other, with 5000 training episodes, 100 validation episodes, and 1000 test episodes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets described (Bouncing Shapes, Bouncing Shapes with Collision, and 3-body Physics) appear to be original datasets created by the authors for their experiments, and thus they may not have formal citations in the literature. 

Instead, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Bouncing Shapes (2-BS and 3-BS)**: Original datasets created for this research, consisting of simulated environments with specific configurations of objects.
- **Bouncing Shapes with Collision (3-BSC)**: Another original dataset created for this research, focusing on object interactions.
- **3-body Physics (3-BP)**: An original dataset used in the context of physics-based simulations.

Since these datasets are not derived from previously published works, they do not have formal citations. I will note that they are described in detail within the paper itself.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring that I highlight the original nature of these datasets as part of the research contributions.
