To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Registration for Unsupervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Lihao Liu, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, and Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their technique on "two major medical image datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40)**: This dataset consists of 40 T1-weighted 3D brain images from healthy volunteers, with manual segmentation for 56 structures. The paper states that the images are of size 181×217×181 mm³.

2. **MindBoggle101**: This dataset includes 101 T1-weighted 3D brain MRIs from various public datasets, with 62 images used for evaluation. The images are skull-stripped and have a size of 182×218×182 mm³.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LPBA40 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shattuck, D. W., Mirza, M., Adisetiyo, V., Hojatkashani, G., Salamon, G., Narr, K. L., Poldrack, R. A., Bilder, R. M., & Toga, A. W. (2008). Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures. *Neuroimage*, 39(3), 1064-1080.

- For the **MindBoggle101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klein, A., & Tourville, J. (2012). 101 labeled brain images and a consistent human cortical labeling protocol. *Frontiers in neuroscience*, 6, 171.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
