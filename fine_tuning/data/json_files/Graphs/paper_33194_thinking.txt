To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Neural Network-Based QUBO-Formulated Hamiltonian-Inspired Loss Function for Combinatorial Optimization using Reinforcement Learning" by Redwan Ahmed Rizvee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on various graph datasets, which is a good indicator that specific datasets will be listed.

I will also check the **background section** for any references to datasets used in previous works that the authors may have built upon. This could provide additional context or even lead to the identification of datasets that are foundational to their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "Max-Cut Graph Dataset," I will look for the original source or paper where this dataset was introduced or described. If they mention using a dataset from another study, I will ensure to cite that study correctly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are accurate and formatted correctly.
