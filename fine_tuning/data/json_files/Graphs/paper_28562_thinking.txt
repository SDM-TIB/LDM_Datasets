To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-attribute Controllable Generative Model for Histopathology Image Synthesis" by Jiarong Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on a histopathology dataset containing stained H&E images of urothelial carcinoma, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and results section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing 4,253 histopathology image patches with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. Each patch is accompanied by a paragraph of pathology report descriptions that detail five key morphological visual cellular features.

The authors also reference a previous work for the dataset collection, specifically citing Zhang et al. (2019) in the context of the dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary citation for the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Histopathology Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,253 histopathology image patches of urothelial carcinoma, with each patch having a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. The dataset includes annotations based on pathology reports that describe various cellular attributes.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset as mentioned in the references section of the paper:

- For the **histopathology dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Z., Chen, P., McGough, M., Xing, F., Wang, C., Bui, M., Xie, Y., Sapkota, M., Cui, L., Dhillon, J., et al. *Pathologist-level interpretable whole-slide cancer diagnosis with deep learning*. Nature Machine Intelligence, 1(5), 236–245, 2019.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach allows me to extract relevant datasets effectively while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
