To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles in an epidemic model with two levels of awareness" by David Juher et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss simulations or data collection. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **stochastic simulations** to assess the model's behavior. I will look for specific datasets or parameters used in these simulations. For instance, they mention running simulations with a population size \(N\) and various initial conditions for the states of individuals (susceptible, aware, infected, and unwilling). 

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. The authors may discuss the outcomes of their simulations and any datasets that were used to validate their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or models referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in their simulations, I will ensure to capture the full citation, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes a clear description and the full citation. This will facilitate further analysis or use by other researchers.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
