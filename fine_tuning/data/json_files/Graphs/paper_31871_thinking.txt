To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Assumptions with Respect to Occlusions in Urban Environments for Automated Vehicle Speed Decisions" by Robert Graubohm et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **background and related work sections** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets that inform their research. This could include datasets used for simulations or evaluations of automated vehicle systems.

I will then focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections** to find specific datasets that were utilized in their simulations. The authors may describe the parameters and scenarios they tested, which could indicate the datasets they relied on.

In the **conclusion and discussion sections**, I will look for any mentions of datasets that were critical to their findings or that they recommend for future research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset like the Euro NCAP tests or a simulation environment like CarMaker, I will ensure to find the original sources or papers that describe these datasets and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for any further processing or review.
