To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wireless Transmission of Images with the Assistance of Multi-level Semantic Information" by Zhenguo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **numerical results section (Section IV)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their proposed system using the **MSCOCO** and **ADE20K** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the text. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset contains 123,287 images, with 82,783 for training and 40,504 for validation. Each image is associated with five different captions, which is important for understanding the semantic features extracted during the study.

2. **ADE20K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 27,574 images annotated with 150 semantic labels, ensuring that each image has at least 512 pixels in height and width. The authors note that images are cropped to a fixed size of 128x128 for training purposes.

Additionally, the authors mention testing their proposed system with the **Kodak dataset**, which contains 24 images of a fixed size of 768x512. This dataset is also relevant for the evaluation of their model.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, Springer, 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene Parsing through ADE20K Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

- For the **Kodak dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Kodak. *Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite (PhotoCD PCD0992)*. URL http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak, 1993.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted information for further processing or review.
