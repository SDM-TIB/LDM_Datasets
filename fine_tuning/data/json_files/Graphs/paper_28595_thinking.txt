To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M2A: Motion Aware Attention for Accurate Video Action Recognition" by Brennan Gebotys et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **Something-Something V1 video action recognition benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to confirm the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **Something-Something V1 (SSv1)** dataset. This is a clear identification of the dataset utilized for their evaluations.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Something-Something V1 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Something-Something V1 Dataset**:
  > R. Goyal, S. E. Kahou, V. Michalski, J. Materzynska, S. Westphal, H. Kim, V. Haenel, I. Fruend, P. Yianilos, M. Mueller-Freitag, F. Hoppe, C. Thurau, I. Bax, and R. Memisevic. *The ‘Something Something’ Video Database for Learning and Evaluating Visual Common Sense*. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017-Octob:5843–5851, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset for its experiments, I will not need to search for additional datasets in this case.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Something-Something V1 dataset** as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
