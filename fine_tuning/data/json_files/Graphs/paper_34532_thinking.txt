To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLIDE: A Framework Integrating Small and Large Language Models for Open-Domain Dialogues Evaluation" by Kun Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on dialogue evaluation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **DailyDialog++ Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,259 contexts in the training set, 1,028 in the validation set, and 1,142 in the test set. Each context is accompanied by five positive responses, five random negative responses, and five adversarial negative responses.

2. **TopicalChat Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset lacks multiple positive and adversarial negative responses, which they address by generating additional responses using GPT-4.

3. **PersonaChat Dataset**: Similar to TopicalChat, this dataset also requires augmentation with responses generated by GPT-4 to include multiple positive and adversarial negative responses.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
