To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FaceLit: Neural 3D Relightable Faces" by Anurag Ranjan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on multiple datasets, specifically naming **FFHQ**, **CelebA-HQ**, and **MetFaces**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they confirm the use of the following datasets:

1. **FFHQ**: This dataset contains 70,000 samples of real human faces and is commonly used to evaluate GAN methods.
2. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset consists of 30,000 samples of high-quality human faces, also used for GAN evaluations.
3. **MetFaces**: This dataset includes 1,336 samples of faces taken from museum art images, demonstrating the method's applicability beyond real face photos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Janne Hellsten, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen, and Timo Aila. *Training generative adversarial networks with limited data*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33:12104–12114, 2020.

- For **MetFaces**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Janne Hellsten, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen, and Timo Aila. *Training generative adversarial networks with limited data*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33:12104–12114, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
