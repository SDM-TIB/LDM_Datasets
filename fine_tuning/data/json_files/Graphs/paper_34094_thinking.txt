To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Content Recommendation: Knowledge Graph-Based Semantic Contrastive Learning for Diversity and Cold-Start Users" by Yejin Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on two widely used datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **MovieLens-20M**: This dataset consists of approximately 20 million explicit ratings (ranging from 1 to 5) contributed by users on the MovieLens website. The authors reference the original source of this dataset.

2. **Book-Crossing**: This dataset contains 1 million ratings (ranging from 1 to 10) for books. The authors also provide a link to the dataset's source.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **MovieLens-20M**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens datasets: History and context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

- For **Book-Crossing**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. (n.d.). Book-Crossing dataset. Retrieved from https://grouplens.org/datasets/book-crossing/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
