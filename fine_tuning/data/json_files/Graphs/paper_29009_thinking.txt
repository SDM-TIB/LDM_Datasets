To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CenGCN: Centralized Convolutional Networks with Vertex Imbalance for Scale-Free Graphs" by Feng Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on **five datasets**. I will focus on this section to gather detailed information about each dataset used in their experiments.

The paper lists the datasets as follows:

1. **Facebook**: This dataset was collected from survey participants using the Facebook app, where vertices represent users and edges represent friendships.

2. **Twitter**: This dataset was crawled from public sources, with vertices indicating users and edges denoting following relationships.

3. **Gplus**: This dataset was collected from Google+, where vertices indicate users and edges denote following relationships.

4. **Youtube**: This dataset was collected from a video-sharing website that includes a social network, with users represented as vertices and friendships as edges.

5. **LiveJournal**: This dataset was collected from an online blogging community where users declare friendships with each other, with vertices representing users and edges representing friendships.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites other works that describe these datasets, which will help me provide accurate citations.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations based on the references provided in the paper:

- **Facebook Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & McAuley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 539-547).

- **Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Yang, J., & Leskovec, J. (2015). Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth. Knowledge and Information Systems, 42(1), 181-213.

- **Gplus Dataset**: 
  > Yang, J., & Leskovec, J. (2015). Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth. Knowledge and Information Systems, 42(1), 181-213.

- **Youtube Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & McAuley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 539-547).

- **LiveJournal Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & McAuley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 539-547).

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
