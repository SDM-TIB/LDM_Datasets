To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Advances in Graph-based Machine Learning for Applications in Smart Urban Transportation Systems" by Hongde Wu, Sen Yan, and Mingming Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss specific applications or case studies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and subsequent sections are likely to contain more detailed references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by urban transportation systems and the role of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They mention the use of graph-based machine learning methods, which suggests that datasets related to traffic data or urban mobility might be referenced later.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.3 (GNNs for Emerging ITS Applications)**, where the authors present two case studies: **bike availability prediction** and **lane change intention prediction**. These sections are likely to contain specific datasets used for these applications.

1. **Bike Availability Prediction**: The authors mention that the proposed attention-based STGCN model was applied to predict bike availability using two real-world datasets. I will look for the names of these datasets in this section.

2. **Lane Change Intention Prediction**: In this case study, the authors describe how they monitored traffic flow data to predict lane change intentions. I will check for any specific datasets mentioned in this context.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to bike-sharing systems, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, for the lane change intention prediction, I will find the relevant studies or datasets referenced.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper citations for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and informative for anyone interested in the datasets discussed in the paper.
