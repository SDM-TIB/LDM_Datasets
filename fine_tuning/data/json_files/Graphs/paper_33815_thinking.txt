To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLCE: An Approach to Refining Cross-Entropy and Contrastive Learning for Optimized Learning Fusion" by Zijun Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed CLCE approach is evaluated across **twelve benchmarks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Few-shot Learning)**, they explicitly mention four datasets used for evaluation: 

1. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning benchmark derived from CIFAR-100, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images each.
2. **FC100**: A few-shot learning dataset that contains 100 classes, each with 600 images, but with a more challenging class distribution.
3. **miniImageNet**: A widely used few-shot learning dataset that consists of 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **tieredImageNet**: A dataset designed for few-shot learning, containing 608 classes and a total of 779,165 images.

In **section 4.2 (Transfer Learning)**, the authors mention eight datasets used for transfer learning:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
2. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset for fine-grained image classification, containing 200 bird species with 11,788 images.
3. **Caltech-256**: A dataset containing 256 object categories with a total of 30,607 images.
4. **Oxford 102 Flowers**: A dataset with 102 flower categories, containing 8,189 images.
5. **Oxford Pets**: A dataset with 37 categories of pets, containing 7,349 images.
6. **iNaturalist 2017**: A large dataset with 5,089 species, containing over 800,000 images.
7. **Places365**: A dataset for scene recognition, containing 365 scene categories with over 1.8 million images.
8. **ImageNet-1k**: A large-scale dataset with 1,000 classes and over 1.2 million images used for image classification.

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
