To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pansharpening via Frequency-Aware Fusion Network with Explicit Similarity Constraints" by Yinghui Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on three datasets acquired from different satellites, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the paper includes a **Table I** that lists the details of the datasets used, which is a crucial source of information.

From **Table I**, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **QuickBird (QB) Dataset**: This dataset includes multispectral (MS) images with a spatial resolution of 2.4m and panchromatic (PAN) images with a spatial resolution of 0.6m. The training data consists of 6943 samples of size 64 × 64 × 4 for MS and 256 × 256 for PAN.

2. **WorldView-4 (WV-4) Dataset**: This dataset features MS images with a spatial resolution of 1.2m and PAN images with a spatial resolution of 0.3m. The training data includes 7938 samples of size 64 × 64 × 4 for MS and 256 × 256 for PAN.

3. **WorldView-2 (WV-2) Dataset**: This dataset has MS images with a spatial resolution of 2.0m and PAN images with a spatial resolution of 0.5m. The training data consists of 9641 samples of size 64 × 64 × 8 for MS and 256 × 256 for PAN.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically found in the context of the original papers or reports that describe the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For **QuickBird**, the citation is:
  > DigitalGlobe. *QuickBird Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.digitalglobe.com/

- For **WorldView-4**, the citation is:
  > DigitalGlobe. *WorldView-4 Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.digitalglobe.com/

- For **WorldView-2**, the citation is:
  > DigitalGlobe. *WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.digitalglobe.com/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
