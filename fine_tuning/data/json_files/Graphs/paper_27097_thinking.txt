To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Abstract Visual Reasoning" by Mikołaj Małkiński and Jacek Mańdziuk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluating their approach on **two major benchmark datasets**: Balanced-RAVEN and PGM. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPMs) and mention the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically state that their approach is evaluated on **Balanced-RAVEN** and **PGM**, confirming that these are the datasets of interest.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **Balanced-RAVEN dataset** as a modification of the original RAVEN dataset, which contains visually diverse RPMs with a highly compositional structure. They mention that it includes 10,000 problem instances divided into seven distinct visual configurations. The **PGM dataset** is described as containing 1.42 million RPM problems per regime, designed to test the generalization skills of machine learning models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Balanced-RAVEN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chi Zhang, Feng Gao, Baoxiong Jia, Yixin Zhu, and Song-Chun Zhu. *Raven: A dataset for relational and analogical visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2019.

2. For the **PGM dataset**, the citation is:
   > Adam Santoro, David Raposo, David G Barrett, Mateusz Malinowski, Razvan Pascanu, Peter Battaglia, and Timothy Lillicrap. *A simple neural network module for relational reasoning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4967–4976, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Balanced-RAVEN**: A dataset containing visually diverse RPMs with a highly compositional structure, consisting of 10,000 problem instances divided into seven distinct visual configurations.
- **PGM**: A dataset containing 1.42 million RPM problems per regime, designed to test the generalization skills of machine learning models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing.
