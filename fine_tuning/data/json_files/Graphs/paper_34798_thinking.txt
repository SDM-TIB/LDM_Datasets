To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmT: A Novel Transformer for Generalized Cross-subject EEG Emotion Recognition" by Yi Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on **four publicly available datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets used for classification and regression tasks:

1. **Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED)**: This dataset includes data from 15 subjects and is used to elicit various emotional responses through film clips. The EEG signals were recorded using a 62-channel setup.

2. **TsingHua University emotional profile dataset (THU-EP)**: This dataset consists of data from 80 subjects and involves 28 video clips to elicit emotional responses. EEG data was recorded using a 32-channel system.

3. **Finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset (FACED)**: An extension of the THU-EP dataset, this dataset includes data from 123 subjects and follows the same experimental protocol.

4. **Multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging dataset (MAHNOB-HCI)**: This dataset involves 30 subjects who viewed film clips while various data streams were recorded. A subset of this dataset is used for regression tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SEED**, the citation is:
  > W.-L. Zheng and B.-L. Lu. "Investigating critical frequency bands and channels for EEG-based emotion recognition with deep neural networks." *IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development*, vol. 7, no. 3, pp. 162–175, 2015.

- For **THU-EP**, the citation is:
  > X. Hu, F. Wang, and D. Zhang. "Similar brains blend emotion in similar ways: Neural representations of individual difference in emotion profiles." *Neuroimage*, vol. 247, p. 118819, 2022.

- For **FACED**, the citation is:
  > J. Chen, X. Wang, C. Huang, X. Hu, X. Shen, and D. Zhang. "A large finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset." *Scientific Data*, vol. 10, p. 740, 2023. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02650-w

- For **MAHNOB-HCI**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
