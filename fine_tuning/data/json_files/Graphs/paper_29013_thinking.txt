To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining On Alzheimerâ€™s Diseases Related Knowledge Graph to Identity Potential AD-related Semantic Triples for Drug Repurposing" by Yi Nian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the construction of a knowledge graph from literature, which suggests that they utilized a specific dataset for extracting biomedical annotations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or databases.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where they describe how they constructed the knowledge graph. The authors mention that they obtained triples from **SemMedDB**, a database of biomedical semantic predications extracted from PubMed literature. This indicates that SemMedDB is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the number of triples and entities obtained from SemMedDB, which reinforces its importance as a dataset in their study. They also mention the filtering process that resulted in a specific number of triples, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for SemMedDB, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the research.

The citation for SemMedDB is:
> Kilicoglu, H., Shin, D., Fiszman, M., Rosemblat, G., Rindflesch, T. (2012). SemMedDB: A PubMed-scale repository of biomedical semantic predications. *Bioinformatics*, 28(23), 3158-3160.

Now, I will summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **SemMedDB**: A database of biomedical semantic predications extracted from PubMed literature, containing a large number of triples that were filtered and used to construct the knowledge graph.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
