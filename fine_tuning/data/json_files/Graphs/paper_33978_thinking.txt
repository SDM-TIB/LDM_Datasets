To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP-BEVFormer: Enhancing Multi-View Image-Based BEV Detector with Ground Truth Flow" by Chenbin Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **nuScenes dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly state that their experiments were conducted on the **nuScenes dataset**. They describe it as containing 1000 scenes, each with a duration of approximately 20 seconds, and annotated at 2Hz with 1.4 million 3D bounding boxes across 10 object categories. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential information for citation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is used for 3D object detection tasks in autonomous driving. It consists of 1000 scenes, each lasting around 20 seconds, with annotations at 2Hz and a total of 1.4 million 3D bounding boxes across 10 object categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the nuScenes dataset.
