To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lottery Aware Sparsity Hunting: Enabling Federated Learning on Resource-Limited Edge" by Sara Babakniya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions experimental evaluations with multiple models on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **MNIST**, **FEMNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific configurations or variations mentioned.

I will also check the **tables** within the experiments section, particularly Table 1, which outlines the training settings, including the datasets, models, and data partitioning methods. This table confirms the use of the three datasets and provides additional details about the models and parameters used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

2. **FEMNIST Dataset**:
   > Sebastian Caldas, Sai Meher Karthik Duddu, Peter Wu, Tian Li, Jakub Konečný, H Brendan McMahan, Virginia Smith, and Ameet Talwalkar. *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01097, 2018a.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
