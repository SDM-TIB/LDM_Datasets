To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Graph Representation Learning in Emergent Communication" by Agnieszka SÅ‚owik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of graph convolutional networks in a graph referential game, which may imply the existence of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Environment and Graph Referential Game sections**. Here, the authors describe the game setup and the data used. They mention that the dataset consists of samples where each sample includes a target graph and a set of distractors. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

I will also check the **Results & Analysis section** to see if there are any references to specific datasets or benchmarks used for comparison. The authors discuss the performance of their models but do not mention any external datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. However, it appears that the paper primarily focuses on the proposed game and does not reference any established datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the dataset used in their experiments is a custom dataset created for the graph referential game, consisting of target graphs and distractors. I will document this as follows:

- **Custom Dataset for Graph Referential Game**: This dataset is created by the authors and consists of samples where each sample includes a target graph and a set of distractors. The dataset is not publicly available, and no formal citation can be provided.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in the paper, noting the absence of formal dataset names and citations, and highlight the custom nature of the dataset used in their experiments.
