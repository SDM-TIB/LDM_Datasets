To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Large Language Model" by Chaoya Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and mention the use of benchmarks to evaluate their method. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to locate their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **LAION**: A large-scale dataset with 115 million image-text pairs, used for pre-training the MiniGPT-4 model.
2. **Conceptual Captions**: Specifically, the subsets CC3M and CC12M, which are also used for training.
3. **MMHal-Bench**: A benchmark dataset used to evaluate hallucination in models.
4. **POPE**: Another benchmark dataset focused on hallucination evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LAION**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu, Cade Gordon, Ross Wightman, Mehdi Cherti, Theo Coombes, Aarush Katta, Clayton Mullis, Mitchell Wortsman, et al. *LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:25278–25294, 2022.

- For **Conceptual Captions**, the citation is:
  > Soravit Changpinyo, Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual 12m: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3558–3568, 2021.

- For **MMHal-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Zhiqing Sun, Sheng Shen, Shengcao Cao, Haotian Liu, Chunyan Li, Yikang Shen, Chuang Gan, Liangyan Gui, Yuxiong Wang, Yiming Yang, Kurt Keutzer, and Trevor Darrell. *Aligning large multimodal models with factually augmented RLHF*. ArXiv, abs/2309.14525, 2023.

- For **POPE**, the citation is:
  > Yifan Li, Yifan Du, Kun Zhou, Jinpeng Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, and Jirong Wen. *Evaluating object hallucination in large vision-language models*. ArXiv, abs/2305.10355, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
