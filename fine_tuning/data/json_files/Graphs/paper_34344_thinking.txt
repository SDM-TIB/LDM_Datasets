To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEMIPL: A Semi-Supervised Method for Event Sound Source Localization" by Yue Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of their method to a more complex dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of analyzing human behaviors and sounds in chaotic events, hinting at the use of specific datasets for these analyses.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention the **Chaotic World dataset** in section 3. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its purpose and the number of annotated instances it contains. 

The Chaotic World dataset is described as consisting of 378,093 annotated instances for triangulating the source of sound for Event Sound Source Localization. The authors also specify that they used 456 videos from this dataset, with a breakdown of training and testing videos.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Chaotic World dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kian Eng Ong, Xun Long Ng, Yanchao Li, Wenjie Ai, Kuangyi Zhao, Si Yong Yeo, and Jun Liu. *Chaotic World: A Large and Challenging Benchmark for Human Behavior Understanding in Chaotic Events*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 20156â€“20166, 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the Chaotic World dataset is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
