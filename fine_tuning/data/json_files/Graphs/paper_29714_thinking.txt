To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Slingshot Mechanism: An Empirical Study of Adaptive Optimizers and the Grokking Phenomenon" by Vimal Thilak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a **modular division dataset** for training their models, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention several algorithmic datasets related to mathematical operations, which are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Modular Division Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of sequences representing a mathematical operation of the form a รท b = c, where a, b, and c are discrete symbols. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

2. **Algorithmic Datasets**: The authors mention multiple datasets generated from various mathematical operations, including:
   - Addition: c = a + b (mod p)
   - Subtraction: c = a - b (mod p)
   - Multiplication: c = a * b (mod p)
   - Other operations involving combinations of these basic operations.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The paper cites the original work by Power et al. [17] for the concept of grokking, which is relevant to the datasets they used.

The citation for the original dataset reference is:
> Alethea Power, Yuri Burda, Harri Edwards, Igor Babuschkin, and Vedant Misra. *Grokking: Generalization beyond overfitting on small algorithmic datasets*. In ICLR MATH-AI Workshop, 2021.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details accurately.
