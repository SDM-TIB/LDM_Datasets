To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Causal Knowledge Distillation in Neural Networks" by Nikolaos Giakoumoglou and Tania Stathaki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images with 500 images per class and 10,000 test images. It is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

2. **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012**: This dataset includes 1.2 million images from 1,000 classes for training and 50,000 for validation. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset consists of a training set of 5,000 labeled images from 10 classes and 100,000 unlabeled images, along with a test set of 8,000 images. It is often used for unsupervised learning tasks.

4. **Tiny ImageNet (TIN-200)**: This dataset comprises 200 classes, each with 500 training images and 50 validation images. It is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, designed for more manageable experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, K. Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates and Andrew Y. Ng. *The importance of encoding versus training with sparse coding and vector quantization*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML’11, page 921–928, Madison, WI, USA, 2011.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
