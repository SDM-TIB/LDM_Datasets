To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Representation Learning Network via Adaptive Sampling" by Anderson de Andrade and Chen Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several graph benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset where each node corresponds to a publication and edges represent citations. The training set contains 20 nodes per class, with validation and test sets having 500 and 1000 unseen nodes, respectively.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset also consists of publications as nodes and citations as edges, with a specified training, validation, and test set structure.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with the same structure as Cora and Citeseer.

4. **PPI Dataset**: A protein-protein interaction dataset with multiple graphs, where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

5. **Twitter Dataset**: A heterogeneous dataset consisting of directional relationships between Twitter users.

6. **YouTube Dataset**: A multiplex bidirectional network dataset with various types of interactions among YouTube users.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
