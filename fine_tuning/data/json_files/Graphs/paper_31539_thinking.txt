To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Conceptional Contrastive Learning for Generalized Category Discovery" by Nan Pu, Zhun Zhong, and Nicu Sebe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six generic and fine-grained visual recognition datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on three generic datasets and three fine-grained datasets. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

Upon reviewing the tables in Section 4.1, I find the following datasets listed:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, containing 20,000 images across 100 classes.
4. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, which includes 11,788 images of birds across 200 categories.
5. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset contains 16,185 images of cars across 196 classes.
6. **Oxford-IIIT Pet**: A dataset with 7,349 images of 37 different breeds of pets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet-100**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **CUB-200**:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- For **Stanford Cars**:
  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In ICCVW, 2013.

- For **Oxford-IIIT Pet**:
  > Omkar M Parkhi, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman, and CV Jawahar. *Cats and dogs*. In CVPR, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further analysis.
