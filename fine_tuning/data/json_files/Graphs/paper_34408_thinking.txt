To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Margin Loss: Proposal and Application in Recommender Systems" by Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on two well-known datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Results)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In this section, the author clearly identifies two datasets:

1. **Yelp2018**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed Multi-Margin Loss (MML). The paper provides a link to the dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/reczoo/Yelp18_m1.

2. **Gowalla**: Another dataset used for the experiments, with a link provided: https://huggingface.co/datasets/reczoo/Gowalla_m1.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are publicly available and the paper provides direct links, I will note that the citations are not traditional academic references but rather URLs to the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset:

- For **Yelp2018**, I will note:
  - Dataset Name: Yelp2018
  - Description: A dataset used for recommender systems, containing user-item interactions.
  - Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/reczoo/Yelp18_m1

- For **Gowalla**, I will note:
  - Dataset Name: Gowalla
  - Description: A dataset used for recommender systems, containing user-item interactions.
  - Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/reczoo/Gowalla_m1

Finally, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details and prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset names, descriptions, and links are clearly articulated for each dataset extracted from the paper.
