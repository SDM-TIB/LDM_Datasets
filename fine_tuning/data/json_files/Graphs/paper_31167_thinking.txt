To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Certification Paradox: Certifications Admit Better Attacks" by Andrew C. Cullen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the concept of certification mechanisms and their implications but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of adversarial examples and certifications without naming datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific configurations or modifications mentioned.

In the results section, the authors provide performance metrics for their proposed method across these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in the context of the research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A Large-scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
