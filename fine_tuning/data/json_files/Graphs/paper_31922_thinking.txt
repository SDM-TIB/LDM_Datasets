To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crosslingual Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Languages Based on Multilingual Colexification Graphs" by Yihong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **CLICS**, a dataset of crosslingual colexifications, and the **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**, which is used to identify colexification patterns. This indicates that both of these are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for further details about these datasets. The introduction mentions that the authors use the **PBC** to identify colexification patterns across 1,335 languages, confirming its significance in their methodology.

In the **methodology section**, specifically in **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)** (Mayer and Cysouw, 2014) for their experiments. They also mention that they evaluate their method on **CLICS** (List, 2018; List et al., 2018; Rzymski et al., 2020), which serves as a benchmark for colexification patterns.

I will also look at the **experiments section** to confirm the use of these datasets in their evaluations. The authors refer to the **PBC** and **CLICS** when discussing their experimental setup, further solidifying their importance in the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **CLICS**:
   - Citation:
     > Johann-Mattis List. *Data underlying CLICS version 1.0*. Zenodo, 2018.

2. **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**:
   - Citation:
     > Thomas Mayer and Michael Cysouw. *Creating a Massively Parallel Bible Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3158–3163, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: CLICS
  - Description: A dataset of crosslingual colexifications used as a benchmark for evaluating colexification patterns.
  - Citation: Johann-Mattis List. *Data underlying CLICS version 1.0*. Zenodo, 2018.

- **Dataset 2**: Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)
  - Description: A corpus containing verse-level aligned translations of the Bible in 1,335 languages, used to identify colexification patterns.
  - Citation: Thomas Mayer and Michael Cysouw. *Creating a Massively Parallel Bible Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3158–3163, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.

With this structured approach, I have successfully extracted the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
