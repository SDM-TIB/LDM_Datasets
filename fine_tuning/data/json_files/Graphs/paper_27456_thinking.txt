To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VLGrammar: Grounded Grammar Induction of Vision and Language" by Yining Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention the collection of a large-scale dataset called **PARTIT**, which contains human-written sentences describing part-level semantics for 3D objects. This indicates that PARTIT is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The PARTIT Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe PARTIT as containing **10,613 manually annotated descriptive sentences** paired with images of objects and parts. The sentences are collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and describe detailed object and part semantics for 3D objects. This section confirms that PARTIT is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if PARTIT is the only one utilized. The authors focus on experiments conducted using the PARTIT dataset, reinforcing its significance in their study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the PARTIT dataset. However, since PARTIT is a dataset created by the authors themselves, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The citation for the PARTIT dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **PARTIT Dataset**: Yining Hong, Qing Li, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Huang. *VLGrammar: Grounded Grammar Induction of Vision and Language*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for PARTIT, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the number of sentences, the method of collection, and the purpose of the dataset in the context of the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
