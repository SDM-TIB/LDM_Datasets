To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Assisted Recursive QAOA" by Yash J. Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in sections that discuss the experiments or results. For instance, the authors may describe the types of graphs or instances they used for their simulations, which could include specific datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset of weighted random d-regular graphs, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is a well-known benchmark, I will ensure to include its citation as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information according to the specified requirements, ready for further processing or review.
