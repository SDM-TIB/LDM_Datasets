To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LowFER: Low-rank Bilinear Pooling for Link Prediction" by Saadullah Amin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on "real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on four benchmark datasets: **WN18**, **WN18RR**, **FB15k**, and **FB15k-237**. I will note down these names and any details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table A.1) that summarizes the datasets used, including the number of entities, relations, and the entities-to-relations ratio. This information is crucial for understanding the context of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **WN18 Dataset**:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

2. **WN18RR Dataset**:
   > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

3. **FB15k Dataset**:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

4. **FB15k-237 Dataset**:
   > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., & Gamon, M. (2015). Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge Bases. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
