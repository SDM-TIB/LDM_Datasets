To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-referencing using Fine-grained Topic Modeling" by Jeffrey Lund et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a system for producing candidate cross-references, which suggests that datasets are involved in the validation of this system.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of creating cross-reference resources and hint at the need for datasets that can facilitate this process. However, I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the methodology.

In **section 2.1 (Cross-reference Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used as ground truth for cross-references:

1. **Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced (TSKE)**: This dataset includes 670,796 cross-references between the 31,085 verses of the Bible. It is noted as the most exhaustive resource of human-curated cross-references for the Bible.

2. **OpenBible.info Dataset**: This dataset is derived from user-generated votes on cross-references, containing 344,441 cross-references with non-negative vote totals, and a more selective subset, **OpenBible+5**, which has 50,098 cross-references that received at least five helpful votes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced**, the citation is:
  > Timothy Morton. *Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced*. BibleAnalyzer.com, 2010.

- For **OpenBible.info**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference the website as follows:
  > OpenBible.info. *OpenBible Cross-reference Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openbible.info.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
