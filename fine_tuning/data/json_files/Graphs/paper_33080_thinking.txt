To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unifying Structure and Language Semantic for Efficient Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Structured Entity Anchors" by Sang-Hyun Je et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on standard benchmarks for link prediction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide a table with statistics for the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the names and details of the datasets.

The datasets listed in the table are:

1. **FB15K-237**: This dataset contains 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and has 272,115 training samples, 17,535 validation samples, and 20,466 test samples.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset consists of 40,943 entities, 11 relations, with 86,835 training samples, 3,034 validation samples, and 3,134 test samples.

3. **Wikidata5M (Transductive)**: This dataset has 4,594,485 entities, 822 relations, with 20,614,279 training samples, 5,163 validation samples, and 5,163 test samples.

4. **Wikidata5M (Inductive)**: Similar to the transductive setting, this dataset also has 4,579,609 entities, 822 relations, with 20,496,514 training samples, 6,699 validation samples, and 6,894 test samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that FB15K-237 and WN18RR are subsets of FB15K and WN18, respectively, and provide citations for these original datasets:

- For **FB15K**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd workshop on continuous vector space models and their compositionality (pp. 57–66).

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. Advances in neural information processing systems, 26.

For **Wikidata5M**, the authors cite:
- Wang, B., et al. (2021). Structure-augmented text representation learning for efficient knowledge graph completion. In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021 (pp. 1737–1748).

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
