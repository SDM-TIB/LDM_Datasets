To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Probabilistic Generative Models Harnessing Graph Neural Networks for Disease-Gene Prediction" by Vikash Singh and Pietro Lio’, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the disease-gene prediction (DGP) problem and mention the use of a disease-gene association network. This indicates that there is likely a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their evaluation. They mention the **disease-gene association network from the Stanford Biomedical Network Dataset Collection**, which contains 7,813 nodes (7,294 genes and 519 diseases). This section also references the sources from which the associations were collected, including the OMIM database, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, the DisGeNET dataset, and MINER.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OMIM Database**:
   > Amberger, J. S., Bocchini, C. A., Schiettecatte, F., Scott, A. F., and Hamosh, A. "OMIM.org: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®), an online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders." Nucleic Acids Research, 43(D1): D789–D798, 2014.

2. **Comparative Toxicogenomics Database**:
   > Davis, A. P., Grondin, C. J., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., King, B. L., McMorran, R., Wiegers, J., Wiegers, T. C., and Mattingly, C. J. "The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database: Update 2017." Nucleic Acids Research, 45(D1): D972–D978, 2016.

3. **DisGeNET Dataset**:
   > Piñero, J., Bravo, A., Queralt-Rosinach, N., Gutiérrez-Sacristán, A., Deu-Pons, J., Centeno, E., García-García, J., Sanz, F., and Furlong, L. I. "DisGeNET: A comprehensive platform integrating information on human disease-associated genes and variants." Nucleic Acids Research, pp. gkw943, 2016.

4. **MINER**:
   > This dataset is mentioned but does not have a specific citation in the provided text. I will note that it is developed by the Stanford SNAP group.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Disease-Gene Association Network**: Contains 7,813 nodes (7,294 genes and 519 diseases).
   - Citation: Derived from multiple sources including OMIM, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, DisGeNET, and MINER.

Next, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
