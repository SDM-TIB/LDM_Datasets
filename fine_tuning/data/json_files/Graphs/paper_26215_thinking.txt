To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Accurate Network Embeddings via Very Sparse Random Projection" by Haochen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several real-world networks, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used. In this section, they list the following datasets:

1. **WWW-200K**: This dataset is derived from the web graph provided by Common Crawl, consisting of 200,000 nodes and 32,822,166 edges. The authors mention that it is treated as an undirected graph and is used for K-Nearest Neighbors tasks.

2. **WWW-10K**: Similar to WWW-200K, this dataset is also derived from the Common Crawl web graph, consisting of 10,000 nodes and 3,904,610 edges. It is used for node classification tasks.

3. **Blogcatalog**: This dataset represents a network of bloggers on the Blogcatalog website, containing 10,312 nodes and 333,983 edges. The labels correspond to the categories that bloggers publish in, and it is used for node classification tasks.

4. **Flickr**: This dataset consists of a network of users on the photo-sharing website Flickr, with 80,513 nodes and 5,899,882 edges. The labels represent the interest groups that users join, and it is also used for node classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WWW-200K** and **WWW-10K**, the citation is:
  > Paolo Boldi and Sebastiano Vigna. *Axioms for centrality*. Internet Mathematics, 10(3-4):222–262, 2014. 

- For **Blogcatalog**, the citation is:
  > Lei Tang and Huan Liu. *Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions*. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management, pages 1107–1116, 2009.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Lei Tang and Huan Liu. *Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions*. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management, pages 1107–1116, 2009.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
