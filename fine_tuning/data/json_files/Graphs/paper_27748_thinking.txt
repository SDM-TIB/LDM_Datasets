To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning" by Seungyeon Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both vision and NLP datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention using the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for sentiment analysis. They describe how they utilize both sentence-level and per-token annotations for their experiments.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors introduce a **synthetic MNIST dataset** that they created by modifying the standard MNIST dataset. They explain how they synthesized new images by adding a scaled-down version of a random digit to a corner of the original images, thus creating new classes.

In **Section 4.3**, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which are standard datasets in the field of computer vision. They also refer to the **ImageNet** dataset for larger-scale experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**:

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:

4. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:

5. **ImageNet Dataset**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
