To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SimCGNN: Simple Contrastive Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation" by Yuan Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Yoochoose 1/64**: This dataset is derived from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and consists of six months of interaction sessions from an e-commerce website. The authors specify that they only use the most recent fraction (1/64) of the training sequences.

2. **Diginetica**: This dataset comes from the CIKM Cup 2016 and includes transaction data. The authors clarify that they only utilize the transaction data for their experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for both datasets, including the number of clicks, training sessions, test sessions, items, and average length. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Yoochoose 1/64**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2015. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html.

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > CIKM Cup 2016. *Diginetica Dataset*. Available at: http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
