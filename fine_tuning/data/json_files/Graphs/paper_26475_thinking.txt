To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReLaText: Exploiting Visual Relationships for Arbitrary-Shaped Scene Text Detection with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Chixiang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public text detection benchmarks, which suggests that these benchmarks are datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **RCTW-17**: This dataset contains 8,034 training images and 4,229 testing images with scene texts in either Chinese or English. Text instances are labeled by quadrangles at the text-line level.

2. **MSRA-TD500**: This dataset includes 300 training images and 200 testing images, featuring multi-oriented text instances labeled by rotated rectangles at the text-line level.

3. **Total-Text**: Comprising 1,255 training images and 300 testing images, this dataset contains 11,459 text instances, with 4,907 being curved texts, labeled in word-level with polygons.

4. **CTW1500**: This dataset has 1,000 training images and 500 testing images, with 10,751 text instances, including 3,530 curved texts, annotated in text-line level with 14-point polygons.

5. **DAST1500**: A dense and arbitrary-shaped text detection dataset, it includes 1,038 training images and 500 testing images, with polygon annotations given in text-line level.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
