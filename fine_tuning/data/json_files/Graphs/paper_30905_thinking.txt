To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Graph Position Encodings for Transformers with Weighted Graph-Walking Automata" by Patrick Soga and David Chiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.2.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains the names and characteristics of the datasets.

The paper mentions several datasets, including:

1. **ZINC**: A graph regression dataset for predicting the solubility of various molecules. The authors specify that they used the 12K subset of the full 500K dataset.

2. **CSL**: A graph classification dataset of circular skip link graphs, with specific parameters for the graphs used in the experiments.

3. **CYCLES**: A cycle detection dataset designed to test the theoretical power of graph neural networks.

4. **CYCLES-V**: A variant of the CYCLES dataset with varying cycle lengths.

5. **PATTERN**: A node classification dataset generated using the Stochastic Block Model.

6. **CLUSTER**: Another node classification dataset generated using the Stochastic Block Model, but with a different number of classes.

7. **PLANAR**: A new dataset generated to test the abilities of the proposed position encodings.

8. **PCQM4Mv2**: A graph regression dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge, focused on predicting the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **ZINC**, the citation is:
  > John J. Irwin, Teague Sterling, Michael M. Mysinger, Erin S. Bolstad, and Ryan G. Coleman. *Zinc: A free tool to discover chemistry for biology*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(7):1757–1768, 2012. doi: 10.1021/ci3001277.

- For **CSL**, the citation is:
  > Ryan Murphy, Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Vinayak Rao, and Bruno Ribeiro. *Relational pooling for graph representations*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 97, pp. 4663–4673, 2019.

- For **CYCLES**, the citation is:
  > Ryan Murphy, Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Vinayak Rao, and Bruno Ribeiro. *Relational pooling for graph representations*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 97, pp. 4663–4673, 2019.

- For **CYCLES-V**, the citation is similar to that of CYCLES.

- For **PATTERN** and **CLUSTER**, the citation is:
  > Emmanuel Abbe. *Community detection and stochastic block models: Recent developments*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18(177):1–86, 2018.

- For **PLANAR**, there may not be a specific citation as it is a new dataset generated by the authors.

- For **PCQM4Mv2**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Hongyu Ren, Maho Nakata, Yuxiao Dong, and Jure Leskovec. *OGB-LSC: A large-scale challenge for machine learning on graphs*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
