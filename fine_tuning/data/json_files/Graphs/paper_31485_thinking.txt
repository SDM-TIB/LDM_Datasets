To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision-aid or Controller? Steering Human Decision Makers with Algorithms" by Ruqing Xu and Sarah Dean, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets they used to evaluate their decision-aid algorithms. I will pay close attention to any specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check there as well, as authors often summarize the datasets used for their experiments in that section. I will note any quantitative details provided, such as the number of samples, features, or any specific characteristics that define the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the paper, I will search for authoritative sources or papers that describe the dataset to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
