To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Graph Representation Learning via Predictive Coding" by Billy Byiringiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their experiments utilize standard citation graph benchmark datasets. This indicates that specific datasets are likely detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **CORA**: A citation dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **PubMed**: A larger citation dataset with 19,717 nodes and 3 classes.
4. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)**: A dataset with 56,944 nodes across 24 graphs, used for multilabel classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CORA dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Wang, J., & Yang, J. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM).

For the **CiteSeer dataset**, the citation is:
> G. K. (2007). *CiteSeer: An autonomous citation indexing system*. In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval.

For the **PubMed dataset**, the citation is:
> Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

For the **PPI dataset**, the citation is:
> Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
