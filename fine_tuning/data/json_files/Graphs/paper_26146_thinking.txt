To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks for Reasoning" by Meng Qu and Jian Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "multiple knowledge graphs," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four benchmark datasets: **FB15k**, **FB15k-237**, **WN18**, and **WN18RR**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them.

I will then check the **appendix** for any additional information regarding the datasets, such as statistics or specific characteristics. The appendix provides a summary of the datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and training/testing splits, which is useful for understanding the context of each dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Based on the information provided in the paper, I can compile the following citations:

1. **FB15k**:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In *NeurIPS*.

2. **FB15k-237**:
   > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In *Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality*.

3. **WN18**:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In *NeurIPS*.

4. **WN18RR**:
   > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In *AAAI*.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset, including any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its citation included.
