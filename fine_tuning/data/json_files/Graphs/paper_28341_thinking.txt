To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Mitochondria Segmentation" by Zhili Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on the **MitoEM dataset** and the **FIB-SEM dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section III (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MitoEM dataset**: This dataset consists of two 30 µm³ volumes with a resolution of 30 × 8 × 8 nm³, acquired from rat and human tissues. The authors note that only the labels for the first 500 slices have been published, and they used the first 400 slices for training.

2. **FIB-SEM dataset**: This dataset is obtained from mouse hippocampus and consists of a training volume and a testing volume, each with a resolution of 5 × 5 × 5 nm³/voxel and composed of 165 slices.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MitoEM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei, D., Lin, Z., Barranco, D., Wendt, N., Liu, X., Yin, W., Huang, X., Gupta, A., Jang, W., Wang, X., Arganda-Carreras, I., Lichtman, J., & Pfister, H. (2020). *MitoEM dataset: Large-scale 3D mitochondria instance segmentation from EM images*. In MICCAI.

- For the **FIB-SEM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Knott, G., Marchman, H., Wall, D., & Lich, B. (2008). *Serial section scanning electron microscopy of adult brain tissue using focused ion beam milling*. Journal of Neuroscience, 28(12), 2959–2964.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset clearly, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
