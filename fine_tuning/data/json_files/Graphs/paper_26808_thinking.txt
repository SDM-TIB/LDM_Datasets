To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network based Service Function Chaining for Automatic Network Control" by DongNyeong Heo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the abstract mentions the use of a dataset created from the Internet2 topology and dynamic SFC requests, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they created a dataset from the Internet2 topology and dynamic SFC requests, which consists of 14,735 lists for active requests, with each list containing an average of 26.08 requests. They also provide information about how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors reference a previous work ([16]) that details the data generation and structure, which is crucial for providing a full citation for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> S. Lange, H. Kim, S. Jeong, H. Choi, J. Yoo, and J. W. Hong. *Predicting VNF Deployment Decisions under Dynamically Changing Network Conditions*. In 15th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM), 2019, pp. 1–9.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. The dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **Dataset Name**: Internet2 SFC Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset created from the Internet2 topology and dynamic SFC requests, consisting of 14,735 lists for active requests, with each list containing an average of 26.08 requests. The dataset is split into training (13,135), validation (100), and testing (1,500) sets.
   - **Citation**: S. Lange, H. Kim, S. Jeong, H. Choi, J. Yoo, and J. W. Hong. *Predicting VNF Deployment Decisions under Dynamically Changing Network Conditions*. In 15th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM), 2019, pp. 1–9.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for downstream processing or review, ensuring that the dataset entries are clear and complete.
