To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Consistency in Cross-Lingual Cross-Modal Retrieval with 1-to-K Contrastive Learning" by Richong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **four CCR datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation. I will note this down as it suggests that the datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluated their method on four popular CCR datasets: **xFlickr&CO**, **WIT**, **Multi30K**, and **COCO**. This is a crucial finding as it directly lists the datasets used.

I will then check the **background** and **evaluation datasets** sections for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. The paper provides specific information about each dataset:

1. **xFlickr&CO**: A dataset combining images from Flickr30K and COCO, with multilingual captions.
2. **WIT**: A Wikipedia-based image-text dataset collected in 108 languages.
3. **Multi30K**: An extension of Flickr30K with multilingual captions in English, German, French, and Czech.
4. **COCO**: A dataset that includes translated captions into Japanese and Chinese.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **xFlickr&CO**, the citation is:
  > Emanuele Bugliarello, Fangyu Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Siva Reddy, Desmond Elliott, Edoardo Maria Ponti, and Ivan Vulić. *IGLUE: A benchmark for transfer learning across modalities, tasks, and languages*. In International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2370–2392, 2022.

- For **WIT**, the citation is:
  > Yabing Wang, Jianfeng Dong, Tianxiang Liang, Minsong Zhang, Rui Cai, and Xun Wang. *Cross-Lingual Cross-Modal Retrieval with Noise-Robust Learning*. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 422–433, 2022.

- For **Multi30K**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67–78, 2014.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
