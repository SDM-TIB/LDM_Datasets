To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable and Equitable Math Problem Solving Strategy" by Anup Shakya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "real world large-scale student interaction datasets from MATHia," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Bridge-to-Algebra 2008-09 (BA08)**: This dataset consists of approximately 20 million interactions from about 6000 students and 52,000 unique algebra problems, with around 1.6 million data instances.

2. **Carnegie Learning MATHia 2019-20 (CL19)**: This dataset is larger, containing about 47 million interactions from 5000 students and 32,000 unique math problems, totaling approximately 1.9 million data instances.

Both datasets are publicly available through the PSLC datashop, which is an important detail to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely considered part of the PSLC datashop resources. Instead, I will note that the datasets can be accessed through the following reference:

- PSLC Datashop: 
  > Stamper, J. C., Koedinger, K. R., de Baker, R. S. J., Skogsholm, A., Leber, B., Demi, S., Yu, S., & Spencer, D. (2011). Datashop: A data repository and analysis service for the learning science community. In AIED, volume 6738, page 628.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Bridge-to-Algebra 2008-09 (BA08)**: A dataset with approximately 20 million interactions from 6000 students and 52,000 unique algebra problems, containing around 1.6 million data instances.

2. **Carnegie Learning MATHia 2019-20 (CL19)**: A larger dataset with about 47 million interactions from 5000 students and 32,000 unique math problems, totaling approximately 1.9 million data instances.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations for future reference or processing.
