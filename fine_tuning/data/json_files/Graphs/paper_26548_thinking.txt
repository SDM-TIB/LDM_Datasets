To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph2Plan: Learning Floorplan Generation from Layout Graphs" by Ruizhen Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors utilize a dataset called **RPLAN**, which is a large-scale dataset consisting of 80K annotated floorplans. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for more details about the **RPLAN dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe how the dataset is used for training their deep learning framework, Graph2Plan. They mention that RPLAN provides floorplans represented as raster images with semantic annotations at the pixel level. This section confirms that RPLAN is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work and results sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or compared. However, the focus remains on RPLAN throughout the paper, and no additional datasets are mentioned.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the RPLAN dataset. The authors cite the original work that introduced the RPLAN dataset as follows:

- For **RPLAN**, the citation is:
  > Wu, W., Fan, L., Liu, L., & Wonka, P. (2019). Data-driven Interior Plan Generation for Residential Buildings. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH Asia), 38(6), 234:1â€“234:12.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **RPLAN Dataset**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 80,000 annotated floorplans, used for training the Graph2Plan framework.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
