To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "G2L: Semantically Aligned and Uniform Video Grounding via Geodesic and Game Theory" by Hongxiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of video grounding and mention that their method was evaluated on three benchmarks. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ActivityNet-Captions**: This dataset contains 20,000 untrimmed videos and 100,000 descriptions, covering a wide range of complex human behavior. The authors mention using 37,417, 17,505, and 17,031 sentence-video pairs for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

2. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is adapted from the Charades dataset for the video grounding task and contains 6,672 videos with 16,128 video-query pairs. The authors specify that 12,408 pairs are used for training and 3,720 for testing.

3. **TACoS**: This dataset consists of 127 videos from cooking scenarios, with a standard split of 10,146, 4,589, and 4,083 video-query pairs for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ActivityNet-Captions**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 961–970, 2015.

- For **Charades-STA**, the citation is:
  > Jiyang Gao, Chen Sun, Zhenheng Yang, and Ram Nevatia. *Tall: Temporal activity localization via language query*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5267–5275, 2017.

- For **TACoS**, the citation is:
  > Michaela Regneri, Marcus Rohrbach, Dominikus Wetzel, Stefan Thater, Bernt Schiele, and Manfred Pinkal. *Grounding action descriptions in videos*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1:25–36, 2013.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
