To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Context-aware Neural Machine Translation Using Coreference Information" by Yongkeun Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors experimented with their method on "two document-level translation tasks," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four specific datasets:

1. **WMT Document-Level News Translation**: This dataset is part of the WMT’19 news translation task and includes parallel corpora annotated with document boundaries. The authors specify that they combined several sources to create a training set containing 3.7 million examples.

2. **IWSLT TED Talk**: This dataset consists of transcriptions of TED talks in various languages. The authors used the 2017 version of the training set, which includes 232,000 examples, with a subset containing cross-sentential coreferences.

3. **OpenSubtitles 2018**: This dataset contains parallel sentences from movie subtitles. The authors filtered the raw corpus to create a training set of 3.9 million examples, with a portion containing cross-sentential coreferences.

4. **Web-Crawled English-Korean Subtitles**: This dataset was created by crawling bilingual subtitle files from various websites. The final dataset contains 1.6 million examples for training, along with validation and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Web-Crawled English-Korean Subtitles**: Since this dataset is created by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will note it as an internal dataset without a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
