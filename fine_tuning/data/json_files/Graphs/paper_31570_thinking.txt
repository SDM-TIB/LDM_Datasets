To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GlueStick: Robust Image Matching by Sticking Points and Lines Together" by RÃ©mi Pautrat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a wide variety of datasets and tasks, which indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments. I will look for specific names or references to datasets in these sections.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors typically provide the names of the datasets, the number of samples, and any relevant characteristics that define how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will specifically look for subsections that might be titled "Datasets" or similar. Here, the authors often provide a comprehensive list of datasets, including their purpose, size, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for proper attribution. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MegaDepth dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Zhengqi Li and Noah Snavely. *Megadepth: Learning single-view depth prediction from internet photos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all necessary information is documented accurately and comprehensively.
