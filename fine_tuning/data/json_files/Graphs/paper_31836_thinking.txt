To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrudeBERT: Applying Economic Theory towards fine-tuning Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Models to the Crude Oil Market" by Himmet Kaplan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a new sentiment analysis model (CrudeBERT) and its evaluation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, specifically **subsections 3.1.1 (News Data)** and **3.1.2 (Price Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **News Data**: The dataset consists of approximately 46,000 news headlines relevant to the crude oil market, collected from the RavenPack Realtime news Discovery platform. The headlines span from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2021, and originate from 1,034 unique news sources, primarily from Dow Jones, Reuters, and Bloomberg.

2. **Price Data**: This dataset includes historical WTI crude oil prices obtained from investing.com, covering the same period as the news headlines. The authors emphasize that WTI prices are particularly relevant for their research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets themselves do not have formal citations like traditional datasets, as they are derived from proprietary sources (RavenPack for news data and investing.com for price data). Therefore, I will note the sources as follows:

- For **News Data**:
  > RavenPack. *Realtime News Discovery Platform*. [Link to RavenPack](https://www.ravenpack.com)

- For **Price Data**:
  > Investing.com. *Historical WTI Crude Oil Prices*. [Link to Investing.com](https://www.investing.com)

Now, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
