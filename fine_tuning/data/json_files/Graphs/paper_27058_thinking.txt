To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Networks for Pulmonary Disease Diagnosis using Auditory and Demographic Information" by Morteza Hosseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a "publicly released pulmonary auditory dataset," which suggests that there is a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, I will find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Respiratory Sound Database**: This dataset includes 920 recordings from 126 participants, annotated with 8 types of respiratory conditions. The authors describe the types of medical equipment used for recording and the duration of each recording, which ranges from 10 to 90 seconds.

2. **UTKFace Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 20,000 face images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity. The authors mention that they used this dataset to train a ResNet-34 model for demographic classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Respiratory Sound Database**, the citation is:
  > Bruno M Rocha, Dimitris Filos, Luís Mendes, Gorkem Serbes, Sezer Ulukaya, Yasemin P Kahya, Nikša Jakovljevic, Tatjana L Turukalo, Ioannis M Vogiatzis, Eleni Perantoni, et al. *An open access database for the evaluation of respiratory sound classification algorithms*. Physiological Measurement 40, 3 (2019), 035001.

- For the **UTKFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhifei Zhang, Yang Song, and Hairong Qi. *Age progression/regression by conditional adversarial autoencoder*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 5810–5818, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
