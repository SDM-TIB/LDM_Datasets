To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Knowledge Graph Embedding Methods from a Multi-Embedding Interaction Perspective" by Hung Nghiep Tran and Atsuhiro Takasu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that knowledge graphs are used in various applications, but they do not specify datasets at this point. I will then move to the **experimental settings section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their empirical analysis.

In **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors state that they used the **WN18 dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as the most popular benchmark dataset built on WordNet, which includes 40,943 entities, 18 relations, and a total of 141,442 training triples, along with validation and test triples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WN18 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-Relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2787â€“2795, 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WN18 Dataset**: A benchmark dataset built on WordNet, containing 40,943 entities, 18 relations, 141,442 training triples, 5,000 validation triples, and 5,000 test triples.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
