To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SETCSE: Set Operations Using Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings" by Kang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its applications, but it may not list specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections** for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in sentence embedding models and their applications in various tasks. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here. I will then move to the **evaluation section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In **section 5 (Evaluation)**, the authors mention four datasets used to cover a diverse range of semantics:
1. **AG News Title and Description (AGT and AGD)**: This dataset is used for news categorization tasks.
2. **Financial PhraseBank (FPB)**: This dataset contains financial phrases and is used for sentiment analysis.
3. **Banking77**: A dataset used for intent classification in banking-related queries.
4. **Facebook Multilingual Task Oriented Dataset (FMTOD)**: This dataset is used for multilingual task-oriented dialogue systems.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **AG News**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., & Le, Q. (2015). *Text Understanding from Scratch*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.01710.

- For **Financial PhraseBank**, the citation is:
  > Malo, P., Grivas, D., & Kallia, M. (2014). *Good Debt or Bad Debt: Detecting Semantic Orientations in Economic Texts*. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 65(4), 782-796.

- For **Banking77**, the citation is:
  > Casanueva, I., Temcinas, T., Gerz, D., Henderson, M., & Vulic, I. (2020). *Efficient Intent Detection with Dual Sentence Encoders*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on NLP for ConvAI.

- For **FMTOD**, the citation is:
  > Schuster, S., Gupta, S., Shah, R., & Lewis, M. (2018). *Cross-lingual Transfer Learning for Multilingual Task Oriented Dialog*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.13327.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
