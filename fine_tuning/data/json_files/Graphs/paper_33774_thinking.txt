To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Left and Right Brains Together: Towards Vision and Language Planning" by Jun Cen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework across various vision-language tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **STAR Dataset**: This dataset comprises 60,000 situated reasoning questions, 24,000 candidate choices, and 22,000 trimmed situation video clips. It covers various question types, including interaction, sequence, prediction, and feasibility.

2. **NExT-QA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5440 videos, each with an average duration of 44 seconds, and includes approximately 52,000 manually annotated question-answer pairs categorized into causal, temporal, and descriptive questions.

3. **BDD-X Dataset**: This is a textual autonomous driving dataset that annotates descriptions and actions of 77 hours of video from the BDD dataset, with a focus on video captioning performance.

4. **BAIR Dataset**: This dataset records 30,000 videos of a robot pushing multiple objects, providing the X, Y, and Z location of the robot gripper for each frame.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, B., Yu, S., Chen, Z., Tenenbaum, J. B., & Gan, C. (2021). STAR: A benchmark for situated reasoning in real-world videos. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2).

- For **NExT-QA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Shang, X., Yao, A., & Chua, T.-S. (2021). NExT-QA: Next phase of question-answering to explaining temporal actions. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **BDD-X Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kim, J., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Canny, J., & Akata, Z. (2018). Textual explanations for self-driving vehicles. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **BAIR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ebert, F., Finn, C., Lee, A. X., & Levine, S. (2017). Self-supervised visual planning with temporal skip connections. CoRL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
