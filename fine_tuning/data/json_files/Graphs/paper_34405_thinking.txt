To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Gait-based Emotion Representation Learning from Selective Strongly Augmented Skeleton Sequences" by Cheng Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on the **Emotion-Gait (E-Gait)** and **Emilya datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Emotion-Gait (E-Gait)**: This dataset includes 2,177 real gaits, each labeled with one of four emotion classes (angry, neutral, happy, or sad). It consists of two parts, with the first part containing 342 gaits from diverse sources and the second part derived from ELMD, comprising 1,835 real gait sequences.

2. **Emilya**: This dataset contains emotional body expressions related to seven daily actions performed by twelve actors, with eight emotions represented. The authors specifically mention using motion capture data of simple walking with four emotions (anger, neutral, joy, and sadness).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Emotion-Gait (E-Gait)**, the citation is:
  > U. Bhattacharya, T. Mittal, R. Chandra, T. Randhavane, A. Bera, and D. Manocha. *Step: Spatial temporal graph convolutional networks for emotion perception from gaits*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), vol. 34, no. 02, 2020, pp. 1342–1350.

- For **Emilya**, the citation is:
  > N. Fourati and C. Pelachaud. *Perception of emotions and body movement in the emilya database*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 90–101, 2016.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
