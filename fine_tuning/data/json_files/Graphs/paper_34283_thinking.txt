To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArtNeRF: A Stylized Neural Field for 3D-Aware Cartoonized Face Synthesis" by Zichen Tang and Hongyu Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's ability to generate 3D-aware cartoon faces, but they do not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they utilize **CelebA** and **AAHQ** datasets. 

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing approximately 200,000 faces, which serves as the source domain dataset for their model. 

2. **AAHQ Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as an artistic dataset comprising around 24,000 high-quality stylized faces, used for the style domain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730–3738.

- For **AAHQ**, the citation is:
  > Liu, M., Li, Q., Qin, Z., Zhang, G., Wan, P., Zheng, W. (2021). *Blendgan: Implicitly GAN blending for arbitrary stylized face generation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 29710–29722.

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the paper along with their full citations. 

Now, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
