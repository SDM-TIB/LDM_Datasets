To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PolyGNN: Polyhedron-based Graph Neural Network for 3D Building Reconstruction from Point Clouds" by Zhaiyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a large-scale synthetic dataset covering over 500,000 buildings with well-defined ground truths of polyhedral class labels. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created. They mention that the dataset consists of simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds and their corresponding building mesh models, which allows for reliable mapping between the two sources. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides details about its purpose and composition.

The authors state that the dataset includes **281,000+ buildings in Munich, Germany**, with an additional **10,000 buildings reserved for evaluation**. They also mention that they synthesized data from **220,000+ buildings in Nuremberg, Germany** to assess the transferability of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is synthetic and created by the authors themselves, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available through the authors' GitHub repository, as mentioned in the abstract.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Synthetic LiDAR Dataset**: A large-scale synthetic dataset created by the authors, consisting of simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds and corresponding building models, available at: [https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/polygnn](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/polygnn).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation details, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
