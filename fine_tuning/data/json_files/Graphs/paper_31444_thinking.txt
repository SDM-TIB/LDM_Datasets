To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Topological Order using Recurrent Neural Networks" by Mohamed Hibat-Allah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections discussing the toric code and the Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice. These sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

In the results section, I find that the authors mention two specific models:

1. **Toric Code**: The authors describe the Hamiltonian and the setup used for the simulations. They mention that the model is defined on a square lattice with a specific configuration of spins. However, they do not provide a separate dataset name but rather describe the model parameters and configurations used in their simulations.

2. **Bose-Hubbard Model on Kagome Lattice**: Similarly, the authors describe the Hamiltonian and the configurations used for this model. Again, there is no explicit dataset name provided, but the authors detail the parameters and the lattice structure.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets in a conventional sense (like a publicly available dataset), I will note that the datasets are essentially the configurations and parameters derived from the models described. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that correspond to datasets or models used in the experiments. The references may provide additional context or sources for the models discussed.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers related to the toric code and Bose-Hubbard models, which may serve as the basis for the datasets they used in their simulations. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses models and configurations extensively, it does not provide explicit dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **Toric Code**: The dataset is derived from the Hamiltonian defined on a square lattice with specific spin configurations, but no formal dataset citation is provided.
- **Bose-Hubbard Model on Kagome Lattice**: Similar to the toric code, the dataset is based on the Hamiltonian and configurations described, with no formal dataset citation.

Since there are no explicit datasets to cite, I will document the models and their descriptions instead of traditional dataset citations. This approach reflects the nature of the research, which focuses on theoretical models rather than publicly available datasets.
