To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Modelling Approaches for Forecasting Energy Spot Prices" by Tahir Miriyev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The introduction provides context about the forecasting of electricity spot prices, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Our approaches)**, where the authors discuss various models for forecasting. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing these models. If the authors mention using historical electricity spot prices, I will note the time period and source of this data.

In the **conclusions section**, the authors may summarize their findings and possibly mention the datasets again, confirming their usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to specific datasets or studies that provided the data, I will ensure to capture those citations accurately.

For example, if the authors mention using historical electricity spot prices from a specific market or organization, I will look for the original source of that data and provide the full citation.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
