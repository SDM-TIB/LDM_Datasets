To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PolyWorld: Polygonal Building Extraction with Graph Neural Networks in Satellite Images" by Stefano Zorzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated using a specific dataset, which is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset** for training and testing their model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset in the **methodology or implementation sections**. The authors provide information about the dataset's size and format, stating that it consists of over 280,000 satellite images for training and 60,000 images for testing, with polygon annotations in MS COCO format.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> S. P. Mohanty. *CrowdAI mapping challenge 2018 dataset*, 2019 (accessed November 10, 2019). https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/mapping-challenge.

This citation is essential for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset entry.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset**: This dataset is composed of over 280,000 satellite images for training and 60,000 images for testing, with polygon annotations provided in MS COCO format.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
