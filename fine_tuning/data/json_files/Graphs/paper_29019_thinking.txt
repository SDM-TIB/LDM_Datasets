To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Phase Retrieval with Structured Tensor Models" by Soo Min Kwon, Xin Li, and Anand D. Sarwate, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on real video datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors specifically mention two datasets used for their experiments: the **Mouse Dataset** and the **Plane Dataset**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **Mouse Dataset**: This dataset consists of a video of a mouse moving towards a camera, containing 90 frames, each downsized to dimensions of 40 × 80. The measurements for this dataset are generated using real and complex Gaussian distributions.

2. **Plane Dataset**: This dataset features a video of a plane landing on a runway, also comprising 90 frames, with each frame downsized to dimensions of 40 × 55. The measurements are generated according to a coded diffraction pattern (CDP) model.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the original source of the datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For the **Mouse Dataset**, the citation is:
> Nayer, S., Narayanamurthy, P., & Vaswani, N. (2020). Provable low rank phase retrieval. *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*, 66(9), 5875–5903.

For the **Plane Dataset**, the citation is:
> Nayer, S., Narayanamurthy, P., & Vaswani, N. (2020). Low rank Fourier ptychography. *IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)*, 6538–6542.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
