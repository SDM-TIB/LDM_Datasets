To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building-GAN: Graph-Conditioned Architectural Volumetric Design Generation" by Kai-Hung Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a synthetic dataset containing 120,000 volumetric designs based on realistic building requirements, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Representation and Data Collection)**, where the authors discuss the dataset in detail. They mention that they created a synthetic dataset with 120,000 volumetric designs for commercial buildings using parametric models. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and purpose.

In this section, the authors describe how the dataset is generated, including the site conditions and the parameters used for creating the volumetric designs. They also mention that the dataset is represented in voxel graph format and can be converted into conventional voxels, meshes, or solid geometries. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and usability.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is synthetic and created by the authors, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is part of the authors' contributions and will reference the paper itself.

The relevant dataset information I will extract includes:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Contains 120,000 volumetric designs based on realistic building requirements, generated using parametric models. The dataset is structured in voxel graph format.

Since the dataset is created by the authors and does not have an external citation, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset will be:
> Kai-Hung Chang, Chin-Yi Cheng, Jieliang Luo, Shingo Murata, Mehdi Nourbakhsh, and Yoshito Tsuji. *Building-GAN: Graph-Conditioned Architectural Volumetric Design Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the extracted information, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing.
