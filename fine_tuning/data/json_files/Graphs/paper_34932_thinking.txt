To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiasScanner: Automatic Detection and Classification of News Bias to Strengthen Democracy" by Tim Menzner and Jochen L. Leidner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the BiasScanner application and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction and related work sections may provide more context.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference several datasets used for media bias detection. Specifically, they mention:

1. **BABE Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training their model. It is noted that the BiasScanner uses a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model on articles constructed from the BABE dataset.

2. **Media Bias Datasets**: The authors refer to various datasets released by other researchers, including those labeled for political partisanship bias and other quality dimensions. They mention datasets from Arapakis et al. [2], Horne et al. [17], and others, but do not provide specific names or details in this section.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **BABE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Spinde, T., et al. "Neural media bias detection using distant supervision with BABE - bias annotations by experts." In: Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021. pp. 1166–1177. Association for Computational Linguistics, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (2021).

- For the dataset by **Arapakis et al.**, the citation is:
  > Arapakis, I., et al. "Linguistic benchmarks of online news article quality." In: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. pp. 1893–1902. ACL, Berlin, Germany (2016).

- For the dataset by **Horne et al.**, the citation is:
  > Horne, B.D., et al. "Sampling the news producers: A large news and feature data set for the study of the complex media landscape." (2018).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **BABE Dataset**: Used for training the BiasScanner model, focusing on bias annotations.
2. **Media Bias Datasets**: Various datasets referenced for media bias detection, including those by Arapakis et al. and Horne et al.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited.
