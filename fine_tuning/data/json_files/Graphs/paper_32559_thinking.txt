To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Drivers’ Situation Awareness in Semi-Autonomous Vehicles" by Jakob Suchan and Jan-Patrick Osterloh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **technical setup and data section** (Section 2.3) where the authors describe the integration of their system with simulators and real vehicles. Here, they mention two types of data: **Scene Data** and **Eye-Tracking Data**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the study.

1. **Scene Data**: This dataset includes telemetry information from the ego vehicle and environmental data, which is published as ROS messages. It contains various attributes such as vehicle ID, type, position, orientation, velocities, and more.

2. **Eye-Tracking Data**: This dataset consists of gaze coordinates and fixations within the ego view of the scene, captured by a mobile eye-tracker. The data is translated into a 3D vector format for integration into the system.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not derived from external sources but are generated from the authors' own system and experimental setup.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the datasets described.

The citation for the paper is:
> Suchan, J., & Osterloh, J.-P. (2023). Assessing Drivers’ Situation Awareness in Semi-Autonomous Vehicles. In S. Costantini et al. (Eds.), *ICLP 2023* (pp. 300–313). EPTCS 385. doi:10.4204/EPTCS.385.29

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
