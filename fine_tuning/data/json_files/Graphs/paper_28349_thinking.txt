To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Contrastive Learning Approach to Auroral Identification and Classification" by Jeremiah W. Johnson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a "recently released auroral image dataset constructed using image data from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imagers." This suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will look closely at the **Methodology section**, particularly the **Data subsection**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the dataset they are using, which is referred to as the **Oslo Auroral THEMIS (OATH) dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images (5,824) and the categories into which these images are classified (Arc, Discrete, Diffuse, Cloudy, Moon, Clear/No aurora).

In this section, the authors also provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. The dataset is publicly available at the URL: http://tid.uio.no/plasma/oath/oath_v1.1_20181026.tgz.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Clausen et al. (2018) that describes the dataset. The citation for this work is:

> L. B. Clausen and H. Nickisch. "Automatic classification of auroral images from the Oslo Auroral THEMIS (OATH) data set using machine learning." *Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics*, vol. 123, no. 7, pp. 5640â€“5647, 2018.

This citation will be important for properly attributing the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear documentation of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology section, focusing on the data subsection for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references for proper attribution.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and completeness.
