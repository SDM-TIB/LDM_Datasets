To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehend DeepWalk as Matrix Factorization" by Cheng Yang and Zhiyuan Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the DeepWalk algorithm and its application to social networks, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Notation)** and **section 2 (Proof)**, where the authors describe the DeepWalk algorithm and its mathematical foundations. These sections focus more on the theoretical aspects rather than specific datasets. 

I will then check **section 3 (Discussion)**, which may provide insights into the datasets used for the experiments or examples that illustrate the application of the DeepWalk algorithm. However, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for empirical validation.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the DeepWalk algorithm. The references include several foundational papers on word embeddings and matrix factorization, but they do not specify datasets either.

Given that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries or citations as there are none to report.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper "Comprehend DeepWalk as Matrix Factorization" by Cheng Yang and Zhiyuan Liu, and thus no citations can be provided.
