To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker Representation Learning via Contrastive Loss with Maximal Speaker Separability" by Zhe Li and Man-Wai Mak, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **CN-Celeb** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the CN-Celeb dataset, which is composed of CN-Celeb1 and CN-Celeb2. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of speakers, recordings, and evaluation trials. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

In the **A. Dataset subsection**, the authors provide a detailed description of CN-Celeb, including its composition and the genres of recordings. This section confirms that CN-Celeb is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CN-Celeb dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CN-Celeb**:
  > Y. Fan, J. Kang, L. Li, K. Li, H. Chen, S. Cheng, P. Zhang, Z. Zhou, Y. Cai, and D. Wang. *CN-Celeb: A Challenging Chinese Speaker Recognition Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 7604â€“7608, 2020.

Since CN-Celeb is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for CN-Celeb, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurately reflects the source as required.
