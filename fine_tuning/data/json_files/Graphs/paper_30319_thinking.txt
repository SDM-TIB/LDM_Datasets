To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Text Classification with Dual Contrastive Consistency Training" by Liwen Sun and Jiawei Han, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. I will look for the names of these datasets in the introduction.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four benchmark text classification datasets: **SST2**, **SUBJ**, **PC**, and **IMDB**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **table 1** within section 4.1, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of training, test, unlabeled, and development samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and usage.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **SST2 Dataset**:
   > Richard Socher, John Bauer, Christopher D. Manning, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Parsing with compositional vector grammars*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 455–465, 2013.

2. **SUBJ Dataset**:
   > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts*. In Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-04), pages 271–278, 2004.

3. **PC Dataset**:
   > Murthy Ganapathibhotla and Bing Liu. *Mining opinions in comparative sentences*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008), pages 241–248, 2008.

4. **IMDB Dataset**:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
