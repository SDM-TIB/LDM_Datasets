To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Richly Activated Graph Convolutional Network for Action Recognition with Incomplete Skeletons" by Yi-Fan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **NTU RGB+D dataset** and a **synthetic occlusion dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **section 3.1**, they describe the **NTU RGB+D dataset** as follows: it contains 56,880 video samples collected by Microsoft Kinect v2, consisting of 60 action classes performed by 40 subjects. They also mention two benchmarks for this dataset: cross-subject and cross-view, which further confirms its significance in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors state that they constructed a **synthetic occlusion dataset** based on the NTU RGB+D dataset, where some joints are occluded over both spatial and temporal dimensions. This dataset is specifically designed to test the robustness of their model against incomplete skeletons.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **NTU RGB+D dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010â€“1019, 2016.

2. The **synthetic occlusion dataset** does not have a separate citation since it is derived from the NTU RGB+D dataset. Therefore, I will reference the NTU RGB+D dataset citation for this dataset as well.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
