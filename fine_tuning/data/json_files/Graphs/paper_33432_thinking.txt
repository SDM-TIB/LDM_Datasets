To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Contrastive Reconstruction for Cross-modal Medical Image-Report Retrieval" by Zeqiang Wei, Kai Jin, and Xiuzhuang Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their approach on the **MIMIC-CXR dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors provide a detailed description of the **MIMIC-CXR dataset**. They mention that it is the largest openly available chest X-ray image dataset, containing data from **65,379 patients** and comprising **377,100 chest X-ray images** along with **227,835 semi-structured free-text radiology reports**. They also specify that their research focuses on the findings section of the reports and provide information on how they partitioned the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Johnson A. E, Pollard T. J, Berkowitz S. J, et al. *MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports*. Scientific data, 2019, 6(1): 317.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**: This dataset includes chest X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports, specifically focusing on findings. It contains 377,100 images and 227,835 reports, partitioned into training, validation, and test sets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
