To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Knowledge Graph Embeddings with Type Regularizer" by Bhushan Kotnis and Vivi Nastase, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on **Freebase**, a well-known knowledge graph, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using **FB15K**, a subset of Freebase, which is a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating link prediction algorithms. The paper provides specific details about FB15K, including the number of relations and entities, as well as the distribution of training, validation, and test sets.

In addition, I will check the **related work** and **methods sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or utilized in the context of their experiments. However, the primary dataset mentioned for their experiments appears to be FB15K.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The citation for **FB15K** is as follows:
- For **FB15K**, the citation is:

In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, C. J. C. Burges, L. Bottou, M. Welling, Z. Ghahramani, and K. Q. Weinberger (Eds.). Curran Associates, Inc., 2787â€“2795, 2013. http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5071-translating-embeddings-for-modeling-multi-relational-data.pdf

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
