To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Deep Learning for the Remote Characterisation of Ambulation in Multiple Sclerosis Using Smartphones" by Andrew P. Creagh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **transfer learning (TL) models from similar large open-source datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of digital health technologies and mention the use of **UCI HAR** and **WISDM** datasets for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they utilized the **UCI HAR** and **WISDM** datasets for training their models. They provide details about the number of subjects and samples in these datasets, confirming their relevance to the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **UCI HAR Dataset**:
   > Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., & Reyes-Ortiz, J. L. (2013). *A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones*. In ESANN.

2. **WISDM Dataset**:
   > Weiss, G. M., Yoneda, K., & Hayajneh, T. (2019). *Smartphone and smartwatch-based biometrics using activities of daily living*. IEEE Access, 7, 133190-133202.

After collecting this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
