To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Group-Fair Plackett-Luce Ranking Models for Relevance and Ex-Post Fairness" by Sruthi Gorantla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the **experiments section** (Section 5) provides a table summarizing the datasets, including their names, number of queries, relevance labels, sensitive features, and other relevant parameters.

From the table in Section 5, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **MovieLens**: 
   - Description: A dataset consisting of user ratings of movies.
   - Citation: Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2016). The MovieLens datasets: History and context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems*, 5(4), 19:1–19:19.

2. **German Credit**: 
   - Description: A dataset encoding users’ creditworthiness as a binary label (0/1).
   - Citation: Hofmann, H. (1994). Statlog (German Credit Data). UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5NC77.

3. **HMDA (AK)**: 
   - Description: A dataset regarding home mortgage loans in Alaska, part of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
   - Citation: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. (2017). HMDA Data Publication. Retrieved from https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/.

4. **HMDA (CT)**: 
   - Description: A dataset regarding home mortgage loans in Connecticut, also part of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
   - Citation: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. (2017). HMDA Data Publication. Retrieved from https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics, such as the number of queries and sensitive features, as these details are crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, to ensure that they are properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
