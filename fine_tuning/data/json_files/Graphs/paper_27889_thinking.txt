To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation for Graph Convolutional Network on Semi-Supervised Classification" by Zhengzheng Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "five real-world datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. I will look for the names of these datasets in the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some context about each one. I will note down the names of the datasets along with their descriptions and any relevant statistics provided.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Citeseer**: A research paper citation network with 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, and 6 classes.
2. **UAI2010**: A dataset for community detection with 3067 nodes, 28311 edges, and 19 classes.
3. **ACM**: A research paper coauthor network extracted from the ACM dataset, consisting of 3025 nodes, 13128 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **BlogCatalog**: A social network with bloggers' relationships, containing 5196 nodes, 171743 edges, and 6 classes.
5. **Flickr**: A social network with user interactions from an image and video hosting website, comprising 7575 nodes, 239738 edges, and 9 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Citeseer**:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
