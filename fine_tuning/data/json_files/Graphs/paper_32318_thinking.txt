To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ethics in the Age of AI: An Analysis of AI Practitionersâ€™ Awareness and Challenges" by Aastha Pant et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, while the introduction elaborates on the context and significance of the research. I will look for any references to datasets used in the study or any surveys conducted.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (Section 3) in detail. This section typically outlines the research design, including any surveys or data collection methods employed. I will pay close attention to the description of the survey, including how the data was collected and the number of participants involved. The paper mentions that a survey was conducted with 100 AI practitioners, which indicates that the responses from this survey constitute a dataset.

I will also look for any specific **data sources** mentioned in the paper. For instance, if the authors refer to any existing datasets or frameworks that informed their research, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results and findings sections** (Section 4) to see if the authors provide any detailed analysis or breakdown of the data collected. This may include demographic information about the participants or specific statistics related to their awareness of AI ethics.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or frameworks mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the original sources.

Based on my findings, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology section for details on the survey and data collection.
3. Identify any specific data sources or existing datasets referenced.
4. Analyze the results section for insights derived from the collected data.
5. Gather full citations from the references section for any datasets mentioned.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the research paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
