To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic coding of studentsâ€™ writing via Contrastive Representation Learning in the Wasserstein space" by Ruijie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with a set of lab reports scored by a four-level scheme, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Complexity of argumentation in biology lab reports)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of the Discussion sections of **146 lab reports from a Biology course**, which were scored by human education researchers. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of reports and the scoring rubric used.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the average length of the essays, maximum and minimum lengths, and the scoring range (1-4). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection of lab reports and does not reference an external dataset, I will note that the dataset is original to this study.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Biology Lab Reports Dataset
   - **Description**: Composed of the Discussion sections of 146 lab reports from an undergraduate biology course, scored by human education researchers using a four-level rubric.
   - **Statistics**: Average length of essays is 512 words, maximum length is 1449 words, and minimum length is 95 words. Scores range from 1 to 4.

Since this dataset is original and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets, I will note that it is created by the authors of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily accessed later.
