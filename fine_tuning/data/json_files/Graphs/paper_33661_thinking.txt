To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Common Sense Reasoning for Deepfake Detection" by Yue Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset for the Deepfake Detection Visual Question Answering (DD-VQA) task, which is a strong indication that a dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (DD-VQA Dataset)**, where the authors describe the construction of the DD-VQA dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset includes triplets of images, questions, and answers, specifically designed for assessing the authenticity of images. This section will provide crucial details about the dataset's content and structure.

The authors state that the images in the DD-VQA dataset are sourced from the **FaceForensics++ (FF++) dataset**. This is an important dataset that needs to be documented as well. The FF++ dataset is described as containing 5,000 videos, with 1,000 being real and 4,000 being fake, employing various manipulation methods.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the DD-VQA dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section**:

1. **DD-VQA Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset will be released to encourage research in the area of deepfake detection, but they do not provide a formal citation since it is newly introduced.

2. **FaceForensics++ Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Andreas Rossler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. *FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1–11, 2019.

After identifying and documenting these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
