To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Neural Algorithmic Planners" by Yu He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, CNAP, is evaluated in environments such as **MuJoCo** and **OpenAI Gym**, which suggests that these environments may be associated with specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention running experiments on environments from the **OpenAI Gym Classic Control suite** and **MuJoCo**. I will note these environments as they are likely to be the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for various environments, specifically mentioning **MountainCarContinuous-v0**, **Swimmer-v2**, **HalfCheetah-v2**, **Humanoid**, and **HumanoidStandup**. These are specific tasks within the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo frameworks, which serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The relevant citations are:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **MuJoCo**:

3. **MountainCarContinuous-v0**:
   > OpenAI. *MountainCarContinuous-v0*. In OpenAI Gym. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/.

4. **Swimmer-v2**:

5. **HalfCheetah-v2**:
   > OpenAI. *HalfCheetah-v2*. In OpenAI Gym. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/envs/HalfCheetah-v2/.

6. **Humanoid**:
   > OpenAI. *Humanoid*. In OpenAI Gym. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/envs/Humanoid/.

7. **HumanoidStandup**:
   > OpenAI. *HumanoidStandup*. In OpenAI Gym. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/envs/HumanoidStandup/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
