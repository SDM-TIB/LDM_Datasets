To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Disease Detection from Social Media Text via Self-Augmentation and Contrastive Learning" by Pervaiz Iqbal Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three NLP datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Dreaddit**: This dataset consists of 3,553 posts from Reddit, categorized into depression and non-depression labels, with a specific training and testing split.

2. **Reddit Health Mention Dataset (RHMD)**: This dataset includes 10,015 Reddit posts related to 15 diseases, with posts labeled into four classes. The authors specify how they divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **DepressionEmo**: This multi-label dataset contains 6,037 Reddit posts associated with eight depression-related emotions. The authors provide the distribution of posts across these emotions and detail the training, validation, and test splits.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Dreaddit**, the citation is:
  > Turcan, E., & McKeown, K. (2019). *Dreaddit: A reddit dataset for stress analysis in social media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00133.

- For **Reddit Health Mention Dataset (RHMD)**, the citation is:
  > Naseem, U., Kim, J., Khushi, M., & Dunn, A.G. (2022). *Identification of disease or symptom terms in reddit to improve health mention classification*. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022 (pp. 2573–2581).

- For **DepressionEmo**, the citation is:
  > Rahman, A.B.S., Ta, H.T., Najjar, L., Azadmanesh, A., & Gönül, A.S. (2024). *DepressionEmo: A novel dataset for multilabel classification of depression emotions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04655.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
