To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negative Prototypes Guided Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection" by Yu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **VOC07** and **VOC12** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their proposed method on both the **Pascal VOC 2007** and **Pascal VOC 2012** datasets, which are commonly used benchmarks for weakly supervised object detection.

In this section, they provide details about the datasets:
- **Pascal VOC 2007**: Contains 5,011 images used for training and evaluation, with 20 object categories.
- **Pascal VOC 2012**: Contains 11,540 images, also with 20 object categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the Pascal VOC datasets are as follows:

- For **Pascal VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-338. (Note: The citation is the same as for VOC 2007, as it is part of the same challenge.)

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
