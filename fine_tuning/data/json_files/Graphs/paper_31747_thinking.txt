To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Aware Neural Network from Similarity and Sensitivity" by H M Dipu Kabir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they apply their proposed method to both synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets Investigated)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Dataset-1**: A synthetic dataset with one input and homoscedastic uncertainty. The paper refers to a previous work for more details.
2. **Dataset-3**: Another synthetic dataset with multiple inputs, where the first input determines prediction, the second input determines uncertainty, and the third input is random to output. Again, the authors reference a previous work for further details.
3. **Global Health Observatory (GHO) data (2000-2015)**: This dataset was collected from WHO and UN websites and is available on Kaggle. It contains 2938 entries with various health-related metrics.
4. **Electricity demand dataset**: This dataset includes data from the UK-grid website, focusing on electricity demand from August 2012 to August 2022.
5. **Wind power generation dataset**: Similar to the electricity dataset, this dataset also comes from the UK-grid website and covers the same time period.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Dataset-1** and **Dataset-3**, the authors reference:
  > Kabir, H.D., Abdar, M., Khosravi, A., Nahavandi, D., Mondal, S.K., Khanam, S., Mohamed, S., Srinivasan, D., Nahavandi, S., Suganthan, P.N. *Synthetic datasets for numeric uncertainty quantification: Proposing datasets for future researchers*. IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Magazine, 2023; 9(2):39â€“48.

- For the **Global Health Observatory (GHO) data**, the citation is:
  > Jarshi, K. *Life expectancy (WHO): Statistical analysis on factors influencing life expectancy*. 2018. URL: www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who.

- For the **Electricity demand and Wind power generation datasets**, the authors mention:
  > UK-grid website. *Electricity demand and wind power generation data*. Available at: www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
