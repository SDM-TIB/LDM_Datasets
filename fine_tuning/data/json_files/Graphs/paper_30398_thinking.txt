To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViFiCon: Vision and Wireless Association Via Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Nicholas Meegan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the use of **pedestrian data collected from RGB-D camera footage** and **WiFi Fine Time Measurements (FTM)**, indicating that these are key datasets involved in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Pre-Processing and Representation section** where the authors describe their dataset selection and pre-processing steps. Here, they specifically mention the use of the **Vi-Fi multimodal dataset**. I will extract the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and the context in which it was used.

The paper states that the **Vi-Fi dataset** consists of collected and labeled walking data across 98 different sequences over 5 scenes, including both pedestrians and participants holding smartphones. This dataset includes RGB-D data, 9-axis IMU data, and FTM data. The authors clarify that they used a subset of scenes from this dataset, specifically Dataset B, which includes outdoor scenarios with participants and background pedestrians.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Vi-Fi dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Hansi Liu, Abrar Alali, Mohamed Ibrahim, Bryan Bo Cao, Nicholas Meegan, Marco Gruteser, Kristin Dana, Ashwin Ashok, and Shubham Jain. *Vi-Fi: Associating Moving Subjects Across Vision and Wireless Sensors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1-10, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the use of **WiFi Fine Time Measurements (FTM)**, which is a protocol introduced in the IEEE 802.11-2016 Standard. I will look for a citation for this standard as well, which is:
> IEEE Std 802.11-2016 (Revision of IEEE Std 802.11-2012). *Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications*. IEEE, 2016.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
