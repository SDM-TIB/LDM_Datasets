To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Area Under the Curve Measures via Matrix Factorization for Predicting Drug-Target Interaction with Multiple Similarities" by Bin Liu and Grigorios Tsoumakas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of drug-target interactions (DTIs) and may reference datasets used in their research. I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using two kinds of benchmark DTI datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of drugs, targets, interactions, and any relevant metrics like sparsity.

The paper specifies the following datasets:

1. **Updated Golden Standard Datasets**: This is a collection of four datasets corresponding to different target protein families (Nuclear Receptors, Ion Channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and Enzymes). The authors mention that these datasets were updated with newly discovered interactions from databases like KEGG, DrugBank, and ChEMBL.

2. **Luo's Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,923 DTIs between 708 drugs and 1,512 protein targets, retrieved from DrugBank 3.0. It is noted for its larger scale and is commonly used to evaluate network-based methods.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Updated Golden Standard Datasets**, the citation is:
- Yamanishi, H., Araki, M., Gutteridge, W., Honda, W., & Kanehisa, M. (2008). Prediction of drug-target interaction networks from the integration of chemical and genomic spaces. *Bioinformatics*, 24(13), i232â€“i240.

For **Luo's Dataset**, the citation is:
- Luo, Y., Zhao, X., Zhou, J., Yang, J., Zhang, Y., Kuang, W., Peng, J., Chen, L., & Zeng, J. (2017). A network integration approach for drug-target interaction prediction and computational drug repositioning from heterogeneous information. *Nature Communications*, 8(1), 1-13.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
