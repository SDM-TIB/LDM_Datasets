To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Computing Optimal Tree Ensembles" by Christian Komusiewicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets when discussing their findings. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets** if available, as this section usually contains comprehensive information about each dataset, including its name, purpose, and any relevant details.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** datasets, I will look for the specific dataset names and their corresponding citations. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining accuracy and completeness in the documentation process.
