To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-backtracking Graph Neural Networks" by Seonghyun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically evaluate their method on the **long-range graph benchmark** and transductive node classification problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors detail their experiments. They mention using three datasets from the **long-range graph benchmark**:

1. **Peptides-func**: This dataset is used for graph classification tasks.
2. **Peptides-struct**: This dataset is used for graph regression tasks.
3. **PascalVOC-SP**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about each dataset, including their purpose and the tasks they are used for, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

- For **Peptides-func** and **Peptides-struct**, the citations are:
  > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampášek, L., Galkin, M., Parviz, A., Wolf, G., & Beaini, D. (2022). Long range graph benchmark. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 35, 22326-22340.

- For **PascalVOC-SP**, the citation is:
  > Gutteridge, B., Dong, X., Bronstein, M. M., & Di Giovanni, F. (2023). DRew: Dynamically rewired message passing with delay. *International Conference on Machine Learning*, 12252-12267.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
