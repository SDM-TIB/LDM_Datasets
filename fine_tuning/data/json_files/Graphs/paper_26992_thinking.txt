To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A step towards neural genome assembly" by Lovro Vrček et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on graphs obtained from real-world genomic data, specifically mentioning **lambda phage** and **E. coli**. This suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **introduction** and **results sections**. The introduction discusses the challenges of de novo genome assembly and mentions the use of real-world genomic data, which aligns with the datasets I noted earlier.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used for testing their model. They mention that the assembly graph for **lambda phage** consists of 60 nodes, while the **E. coli** graph consists of around 3000 nodes. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the lambda phage and E. coli datasets as they are commonly used genomic datasets. Instead, I will provide general references for these organisms:

- For **lambda phage**, a commonly cited reference is:
  > Hershey, A. D., & Chase, M. (1952). Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in the growth of bacteriophage. *Journal of General Physiology*, 36(1), 39-56.

- For **E. coli**, a foundational reference is:
  > Blattner, F. R., Plunkett III, G., Bloch, C. A., et al. (1997). The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12. *Science*, 277(5331), 1453-1462.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Lambda Phage Dataset**: A genomic dataset consisting of sequences from the lambda phage, used for testing the model's performance on small assembly graphs.

2. **E. coli Dataset**: A genomic dataset consisting of sequences from Escherichia coli, used for testing the model's performance on larger assembly graphs.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the relevant details and citations, ready for structured output.
