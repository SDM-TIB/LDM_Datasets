To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KATRec: Knowledge Aware aTtentive Sequential Recommendations" by Mehrnaz Amjadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **three public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon-book**: This dataset consists of Amazon review data specifically categorized under the book category. It includes 70,679 users and 24,915 items, with a total of 2,557,746 interactions.

2. **LastFM**: This dataset captures music listening patterns from the Last.fm platform. It contains 23,566 users and 48,123 items, with 464,567 interactions.

3. **Yelp2018**: This dataset is derived from the Yelp 2018 recommendation system challenge, representing local restaurants and bars as items. It includes 45,919 users and 45,538 items, with 1,185,068 interactions.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are commonly known and do not have specific citations provided in the references.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the datasets where applicable. Since the datasets are widely recognized in the recommendation systems literature, I will provide the following citations:

- For **Amazon-book** dataset:
  > He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 507-517.

- For **LastFM** dataset:
  > Schedl, M. (2016). *The LFM-1b dataset for music retrieval and recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pages 103-110.

- For **Yelp2018** dataset:
  > Yelp. (2018). *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
