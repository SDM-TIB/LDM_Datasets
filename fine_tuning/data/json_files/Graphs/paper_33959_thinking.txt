To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn and Search: An Elegant Technique for Object Lookup using Contrastive Learning" by Chandan Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel approach for object lookup, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of image retrieval and hints at the use of datasets in the context of deep learning applications.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments section, the authors state that all experiments are conducted exclusively on images sourced from **MS-COCO**. This is a significant finding, as it indicates that MS-COCO is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Doll√°r. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used in this research is MS-COCO.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for MS-COCO, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset utilized in the research paper.
