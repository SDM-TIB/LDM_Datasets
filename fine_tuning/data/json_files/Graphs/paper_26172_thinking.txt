To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Spectral-based Graph Convolutional Network for Directed Graphs" by Yi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on several directed graph datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. This section provides a table with key statistics about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, and classes, which will help me understand the context of each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **Blogs**: A directed network of hyperlinks among U.S. political weblogs from before the 2004 election. The authors note that it includes metadata about political affiliations.
   
2. **Wikipedia**: The hyperlink network of Wikipedia pages on editorial norms from 2015. This dataset includes various metadata about the pages.

3. **Email**: A network generated from email data at a European research institution, which includes anonymized communication data and community memberships.

4. **Cora-cite**: A citation network among papers indexed by CORA from 1998, where nodes represent scientific papers and edges represent citations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for semi-supervised node classification tasks, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Blogs dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lada A. Adamic and Natalie Glance. *The political blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. election: Divided they blog*. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery, LinkKDD ’05, pages 36–43, New York, NY, USA, 2005. ACM.

- For the **Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bradi Heaberlin and Simon DeDeo. *The evolution of Wikipedia’s norm network*. Future Internet, 8(2):14, 2016.

- For the **Email dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, June 2014.

- For the **Cora-cite dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cora citation network dataset – KONECT, April 2017.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
