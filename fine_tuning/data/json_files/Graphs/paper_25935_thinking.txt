To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Financial Sentimental Factors in Chinese Market Using Natural Language Processing" by Junfeng Jiang and Jiahao Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors crawled news and comments from several influential financial websites, which suggests that there may be datasets related to financial news.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their data mining process. They mention using **Selenium** to crawl news from various financial websites, specifically highlighting **Chinastock** as the primary source for their text data. This indicates that the dataset consists of financial news articles collected from Chinastock.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the correlation analysis of their sentimental factor with market indexes, but they do not mention any additional datasets. However, they do refer to the **Common Vocabulary of Modern Chinese**, which they used to filter their dataset of words. This is not a dataset in the traditional sense but is relevant to their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset from Chinastock, as it is a web source, but I will note that it is the primary dataset used for their analysis.

The **Common Vocabulary of Modern Chinese** is also not formally cited in the references, but it is a recognized resource in the field. I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in Chinese language processing.

In summary, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **Chinastock Dataset**: This dataset consists of financial news articles crawled from the Chinastock website, which includes a wide range of financial topics and is used to compute the sentimental factors.

2. **Common Vocabulary of Modern Chinese**: This is a reference dataset used for filtering and processing the text data, consisting of over 50,000 common words in modern Chinese.

While the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will acknowledge their significance in the context of the research.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the relevant details for each dataset.
