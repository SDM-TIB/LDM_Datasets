To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Learning to Summarize with Large Language Models as References" by Yixin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CNN/DailyMail** and **XSum** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **experimental setup** sections, which typically provide information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of dataset characteristics, such as size, type, and purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for summarization tasks and consists of news articles paired with human-written summaries. The authors mention using the original validation set for model training and evaluation.

2. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset is designed for extreme summarization, where each article is summarized into a single sentence. The authors state that they followed the original data format for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., Santos, C. N., Gulcehre, C., & Xiang, B. (2016). Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond. In Proceedings of The 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2016), pages 280–290.

- For the **XSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
