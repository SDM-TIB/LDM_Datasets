To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-Series Event Prediction with Evolutionary State Graph" by Wenjie Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on five real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics that describe their contents.

In section 4.1, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **DJIA 30 Stock Time Series (DJIA30)**: This dataset contains around 15,000 daily readings with four observations per trading day. The task is to predict abnormal price volatility based on the past year's records.

2. **Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting (WebTraffic)**: This dataset consists of approximately 3 million daily readings, recording the number of views for specific Wikipedia articles. The goal is to predict rapid growth in views over the next month.

3. **Information Networks Supervision (NetFlow)**: Provided by China Telecom, this dataset includes around 238,000 hourly readings of network device inflows and outflows, with the aim of predicting future anomalies.

4. **Watt-hour Meter Clock Error (ClockErr)**: This dataset from the State Grid of China contains about 6 million weekly readings, focusing on the deviation time and delay of watt-hour meters to predict anomalies.

5. **Abnormal Server Response (AbServe)**: Provided by Alibaba Cloud, this dataset consists of around 12,000 server monitoring series, with the goal of predicting server response anomalies.

After identifying the datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, since these datasets are likely to be publicly available or provided by organizations, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe them.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **DJIA 30 Stock Time Series (DJIA30)**: 
  > Kaggle. DJIA 30 Stock Time Series. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/djia-30-stock-time-series

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
