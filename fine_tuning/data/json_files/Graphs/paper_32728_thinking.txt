To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCOB: Universal Text Understanding via Character-wise Supervised Contrastive Learning with Online Text Rendering for Bridging Domain Gap" by Daehee Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive benchmarks on various tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using **IIT-CDIP** and several real scene text datasets for pre-training, which is a strong indication that these are key datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **IIT-CDIP**: This dataset consists of 11 million scanned English document images with abundant sentence-level texts. It is used for learning language modeling.

2. **ICDAR2013**: A dataset used for evaluating text recognition in images, particularly in the context of scene text.

3. **ICDAR2015**: Another dataset for scene text recognition, similar to ICDAR2013.

4. **TotalText**: A dataset for scene text detection and recognition, which includes complex backgrounds.

5. **OpenImages v6**: A large dataset from which the authors filtered non-text images to obtain pseudo-OCR labels.

6. **TextOCR**: A dataset used for OCR tasks.

7. **HierText**: Another dataset included for scene text recognition tasks.

In the **fine-tuning section**, the authors mention additional datasets used for specific tasks, such as **PubTabNet** for table reconstruction and **CORD** for key information extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
