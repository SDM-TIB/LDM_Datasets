To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Graph Contrastive Learning: A Survey and Beyond" by Wei Ju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the abstract, the authors discuss various applications of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) but do not explicitly mention specific datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or applications. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. 

In the **experiments** or **applications** sections, the authors may describe specific datasets utilized in their studies. For instance, they might mention datasets related to drug discovery, genomics analysis, or social networks. I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named, along with their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Cora" or "PubMed," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the full citation format as required.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of proper citation for each dataset used in the research.
