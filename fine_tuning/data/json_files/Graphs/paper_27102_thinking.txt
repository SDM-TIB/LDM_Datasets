To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphPB: Graphical Representations of Prosody Boundary in Speech Synthesis" by Aolan Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the Databaker company, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved in the research. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section, as these sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. In this paper, the **Experiments** section (specifically section 5) discusses the dataset used for training, which is identified as the **Chinese standard Mandarin speech corpus** from Databaker.

In section 5.1, the authors describe the dataset in detail, noting that it contains graphemes, phonemes, prosodic labels, and corresponding audio recordings. They specify that the dataset consists of approximately 12 hours of recordings from a professional Chinese female news anchor, totaling around 10,000 utterances.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Chinese standard Mandarin speech corpus**:
  > Databaker (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. "Chinese standard mandarin speech corpus," https://www.databaker.com/open_source.html, 2020.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the information in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
