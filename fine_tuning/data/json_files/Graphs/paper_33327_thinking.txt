To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Joint Design of Pilot, Channel Feedback, and Hybrid Beamforming in FDD Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems" by Junyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or simulations.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors mention that they performed extensive simulations based on the public datasets of **DeepMIMO I3**. This indicates that there is a dataset used for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **DeepMIMO I3** dataset. The reference is listed as follows:
> A. Alkhateeb, “DeepMIMO: A generic deep learning dataset for millimeter wave and massive MIMO applications,” 2019. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06435

This citation provides the necessary information to properly reference the dataset.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **DeepMIMO I3**: This dataset is used for simulations in the context of FDD massive MIMO-OFDM systems. It is designed for millimeter wave and massive MIMO applications, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating deep learning methods in this domain.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
