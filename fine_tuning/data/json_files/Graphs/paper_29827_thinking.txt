To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Show Me Your Face, And Iâ€™ll Tell You How You Speak" by Christen Millerdurai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for a section that discusses datasets in detail, which is typically labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. In this paper, I find that **section 4.1 (Datasets)** explicitly lists the datasets used for the experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **AVSpeech**: This dataset is described as a large-scale audio-visual dataset consisting of 3 to 15 second clips from YouTube videos. The authors mention that they sampled 33,000 clips from this dataset to train the Speaker Encoder.

2. **Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)**: This dataset consists of up to 1000 utterances of 500 different words spoken by hundreds of different speakers. The authors sampled 70 clips from this dataset for Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Face encoder evaluation, and another 153 clips for Lip2Speech evaluation.

3. **UTKFace**: This dataset is a large-scale face dataset containing over 20,000 face images of people with ages ranging from 0 to 116 years old, including different genders and ethnicities. The authors used 3000 images from this dataset for training their face decoder.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **AVSpeech**:
  > Ephrat, A., Mosseri, I., Lang, O., Dekel, T., Wilson, K., Hassidim, A., Freeman, W.T., & Rubinstein, M. (2018). Looking to listen at the cocktail party: A speaker-independent audio-visual model for speech separation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03619*.

- For **Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)**:
  > Chung, J.S., & Zisserman, A. (2016). Lip reading in the wild. In *Asian Conference on Computer Vision*.

- For **UTKFace**:
  > Zhang, Z., Song, Y., & Qi, H. (2017). Age progression/regression by conditional adversarial autoencoder. *IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security*, 13(11), 2635-2646.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
