To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VICTR: Visual Information Captured Text Representation for Text-to-Image Multimodal Tasks" by Soyeon Caren Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its evaluation, which may include dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of text-to-image generation and mention various state-of-the-art models. However, I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation setup section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they evaluated their model on the **COCO benchmark dataset**. This is a significant dataset in the field of image generation and is likely to be the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the **dataset statistics table**, the authors provide detailed information about the COCO dataset, including the number of images, captions, and objects. This confirms that COCO is indeed the dataset they utilized for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The paper evaluates the proposed VICTR model using the COCO dataset, which contains diverse objects and relations in images.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
