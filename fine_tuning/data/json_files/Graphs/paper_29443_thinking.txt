To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Robustness of Language Models from a Geometry-aware Perspective" by Bin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments across two widely used datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for sentiment analysis tasks and is part of the GLUE benchmark. The authors provide statistical details, including the number of training and testing examples.

2. **IMDb Dataset**: Another popular dataset for sentiment analysis, which the authors also use in their experiments. They provide similar statistical details as for the SST-2 dataset.

I will take note of the specific details provided for each dataset, including the number of training and testing examples, as well as any relevant characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to locate are:

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of EMNLP (pp. 1631-1642).

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of ACL (pp. 142-150).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
