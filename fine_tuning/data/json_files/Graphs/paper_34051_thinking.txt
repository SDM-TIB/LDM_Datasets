To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Facial Expression Spotting" by Yicheng Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on the **SAMM-LV** and **CAS(ME)2** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that they evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets:

1. **SAMM-LV Dataset**: This dataset comprises 147 raw long videos containing 343 macro-expression clips and 159 micro-expression clips. The frame rate is noted as 200fps.

2. **CAS(ME)2 Dataset**: This dataset includes 87 raw long videos with 300 macro-expression clips and 57 micro-expression clips, with a frame rate of 30fps.

Both datasets are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their descriptions provide insights into the nature and structure of the data used.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SAMM-LV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. H. Yap, C. Kendrick, and M. H. Yap. *SAMM Long Videos: A Spontaneous Facial Micro-and Macro-Expressions Dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 771–776, 2020.

- For the **CAS(ME)2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Qu, S.-J. Wang, W.-J. Yan, H. Li, S. Wu, and X. Fu. *CAS(ME)2: A Database for Spontaneous Macro-Expression and Micro-Expression Spotting and Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 9(4):424–436, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
