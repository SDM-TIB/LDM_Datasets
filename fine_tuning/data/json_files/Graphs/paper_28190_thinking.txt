To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Availability Aware Mixed-Initiative Control" by Giannis Petousakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions an evaluation of the controller in a disaster response experiment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** to identify any specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe a primary exploration task and a secondary cognitively demanding task, but I need to look for any datasets that were used to gather data for these tasks.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors mention that the experiment involved a total of 8 participants performing trials with two different controllers. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets. I will check if there are any references to datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections that could provide more context.

I will also look at the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that were used in the experiments. The references may provide insights into the datasets that informed the study or were utilized in the experimental setup.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any named datasets. However, they refer to the use of a **Gazebo simulated robot** and the **OpenSesame software** for the secondary task, which may imply the use of specific datasets or experimental setups that are not detailed in the paper.

Since no specific datasets are named in the paper, I will note that while the authors discuss the experimental setup and tasks, they do not provide full citations for any datasets used. This is a limitation in the paper, as datasets are crucial for reproducibility and further research.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not explicitly list any datasets with full citations, which is an important aspect that should be addressed in future work to enhance clarity and reproducibility.
