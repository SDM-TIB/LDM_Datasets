To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ego-Vehicle Action Recognition based on Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Chihiro Noguchi and Toshihiro Tanizawa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method using the **HDD dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD)**, describing it as containing 104 hours of egocentric videos with frame-level annotations of vehicle actions. This section will provide crucial details about the dataset's content and structure.

In the **evaluation setup**, the authors elaborate on the HDD dataset, including its resolution, the number of hours of video, and the types of actions labeled within the dataset. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HDD dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> V. Ramanishka, Y. Chen, T. Misu, and K. Saenko. *Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7699â€“7707, Los Alamitos, CA, USA, June 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the HDD dataset as required. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly documented for future reference or use.
