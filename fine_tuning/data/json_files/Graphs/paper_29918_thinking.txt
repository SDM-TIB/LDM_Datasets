To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Asymmetric Contrastive Loss for Handling Imbalanced Datasets" by Valentino Vito and Lim Yohanes Stefanus, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions results on the **FMNIST** and **ISIC 2018** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **FMNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of low-resolution (28 × 28 pixels), grayscale images of ten classes of clothing. For their experiments, the authors only use two classes (T-shirt and shirt) to form a binary classification task. They mention that the dataset is modified to create various class imbalance scenarios.

2. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset includes high-resolution RGB images of skin lesions, specifically focusing on two classes (melanoma and dermatoﬁbroma) for the binary classification task. The authors note that this dataset is imbalanced, with a significant difference in the number of images for each class.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **FMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Codella, V. Rotemberg, P. Tschandl, M. E. Celebi, S. Dusza, D. Gutman, B. Helba, A. Kalloo, K. Liopyris, M. Marchetti, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
