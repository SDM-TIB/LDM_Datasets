To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthiness-Driven Graph Convolutional Networks for Signed Network Embedding" by Min-Jeong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on "four real-world signed network datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in the **experimental setup** section, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: A signed network dataset with 3,784 nodes and 14,145 edges, where 12,729 edges are positive and 1,416 are negative.
2. **Bitcoin-OTC**: Another signed network dataset with 5,901 nodes and 21,522 edges, consisting of 18,390 positive edges and 3,132 negative edges.
3. **Slashdot**: This dataset contains 13,182 nodes and 36,338 edges, with 30,914 positive edges and 5,424 negative edges.
4. **Epinions**: The largest dataset in this study, featuring 25,148 nodes and 105,061 edges, with 74,060 positive edges and 31,001 negative edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but it mentions that they are publicly available and provides links to their sources. Therefore, I will note the datasets along with their respective statistics as follows:

- **Bitcoin-Alpha**: 
  > "Bitcoin-Alpha dataset." Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data

- **Bitcoin-OTC**: 
  > "Bitcoin-OTC dataset." Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data

- **Slashdot**: 
  > "Slashdot dataset." Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data

- **Epinions**: 
  > "Epinions dataset." Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
