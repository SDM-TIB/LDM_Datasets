To extract datasets from the research paper titled "URLBERT: A Contrastive and Adversarial Pre-trained Model for URL Classification" by Yujie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three specific tasks: phishing URL detection, webpage topic classification, and advertisement link recognition. I will look for the datasets associated with each of these tasks.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors used the following datasets:

1. **GramBeddings Dataset**: This dataset is used for the phishing URL detection task and consists of 640,000 training samples and 160,000 test samples.

2. **DmoZ URL Classification Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the webpage topic classification task and includes URLs from 15 different topics, with the authors selecting five categories for their experiments.

3. **Advertisement URL Dataset**: This dataset was collected by the authors themselves and comprises 23,530 ad URLs and 65,263 whitelist URLs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **GramBeddings Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bozkir, A. S., Dalgic, F. C., & Aydos, M. (2023). Grambeddings: A new neural network for URL-based identification of phishing web pages through n-gram embeddings. *Computers & Security*, 124, 102964.

- For the **DmoZ URL Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nokhbeh Zaeem, R., & Barber, K. S. (2021). A large publicly available corpus of website privacy policies based on DMOZ. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (2021), pp. 143–148.

- For the **Advertisement URL Dataset**, since it is collected by the authors, I will note that it is not formally cited in the references but is mentioned in the text as a dataset they created.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **GramBeddings Dataset**: Used for phishing URL detection.
   - Citation: Bozkir, A. S., Dalgic, F. C., & Aydos, M. (2023). Grambeddings: A new neural network for URL-based identification of phishing web pages through n-gram embeddings. *Computers & Security*, 124, 102964.

2. **DmoZ URL Classification Dataset**: Used for webpage topic classification.
   - Citation: Nokhbeh Zaeem, R., & Barber, K. S. (2021). A large publicly available corpus of website privacy policies based on DMOZ. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (2021), pp. 143–148.

3. **Advertisement URL Dataset**: Collected by the authors for advertisement link recognition (no formal citation).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
