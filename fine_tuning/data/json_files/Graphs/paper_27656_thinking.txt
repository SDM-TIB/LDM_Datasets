To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoCon: Cooperative-Contrastive Learning" by Nishant Rai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 videos across 101 action classes, making it a significant resource for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of approximately 6,800 real-world video clips from 51 action classes, which presents challenges due to its diverse content and varying video quality.

3. **Kinetics400**: This is a large dataset with 400 human action classes, containing at least 400 video clips for each action, totaling around 306,000 clips. It is known for its diversity and complexity.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garofalo, J., & Black, M. J. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556â€“2563.

- For **Kinetics400**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
