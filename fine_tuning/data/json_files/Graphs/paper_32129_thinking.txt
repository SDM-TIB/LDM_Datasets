To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Hamiltonian cycles with graph neural networks" by Filip Bosnić and Mile Šikić, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Problem Setup)**, where the authors discuss the evaluation distribution and mention the use of Erdős-Rényi random graphs. They indicate that these graphs are generated with a specific edge probability parameter, which is crucial for the experiments. This section also mentions that the authors rely on a specific theorem to generate these graphs, which suggests that they are using a dataset of generated graphs for their experiments.

In **section IV (Model Details)**, the authors state that they work exclusively with generated datasets and describe how the training dataset is constructed. They mention that the training dataset consists of graphs generated with a specific edge probability, which is a key detail for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the datasets are generated rather than sourced from existing datasets, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note the methodology used to generate these datasets.

The key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs**: These are generated graphs used for evaluating the Hamiltonian cycle problem. The authors specify that they use a critical regime with a probability parameter \( p_H = 0.8 \) for generating these graphs.

2. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of graphs of size 25, generated by connecting nodes into a Hamiltonian cycle and adding edges with a specific probability. This dataset is used for training the model.

3. **Test Dataset**: This dataset is sampled from the evaluation distribution of Erdős-Rényi graphs in the critical regime, specifically designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.

Now, I will compile the information regarding these datasets, ensuring to include any relevant details about their generation and characteristics. Since the datasets are generated rather than sourced from existing literature, I will focus on the methodology described in the paper rather than formal citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that all relevant details about the datasets are captured for further processing or review.
