To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Response to an AI-Based Decision Support System: A User Study on the Effects of Accuracy and Bias" by Andrea Beretta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention that participants played a simple online game designed to study decision support systems. I will look for any references to datasets or data collection methods used in this game.

In the **experimental design section**, the authors detail the game mechanics and the data collected during the experiments. They mention that the platform records all interactions, generating data on player performance, timing, and reliance on the decision support system. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses the design and implementation of a new experimental platform rather than using pre-existing datasets, I will note that the data generated from the experiments is original and specific to this study. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited or if the authors reference any existing datasets that informed their work. However, it appears that the focus is on the original data collected through their experiments rather than established datasets.

Given that the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will summarize the findings related to the data generated from their experiments, but I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the original data generated from the experiments, noting that it is specific to this study and does not correspond to any pre-existing datasets with citations.
