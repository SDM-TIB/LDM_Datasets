To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs" by Enzhi Li and Bilal Fadlallah, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they benchmark their method against existing algorithms and refer to datasets used for evaluation. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they used for testing their algorithms. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **arXiv Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from articles published in arXiv under the category of physics from 2017 to 2020. It consists of 52,144 nodes (articles) and 45,188 hyperedges (authors), where nodes represent articles and hyperedges represent authors who collaborated on those articles.

2. **trivago-clicks Dataset**: This dataset contains behavior data from users browsing trivago.com while trying to book a hotel. It includes 172,738 nodes (accommodations) and 233,202 hyperedges (browsing sessions), where nodes represent accommodations and hyperedges represent the browsing history of users.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **arXiv Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. S. Chodrow, N. Veldt, and A. R. Benson. *Science Advances* (2021). URL: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/trivago-clicks/.

- For the **trivago-clicks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. R. Benson. *trivago-clicks dataset* (2021). URL: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/trivago-clicks/.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
