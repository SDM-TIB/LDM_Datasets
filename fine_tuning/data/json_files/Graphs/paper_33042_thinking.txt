To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Relation Learning for Cross-domain Few-shot Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Chun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the focus on cross-domain few-shot hyperspectral image classification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will specifically look for a section that discusses datasets, which is typically labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. In this paper, I find that **section 4 (Experiments)** contains a subsection titled **4.1.1 Dataset**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Chikusei Dataset**: This dataset was captured by the Hyperspec-VNIR-C sensor in Chikusei, Japan, containing 128 bands and 19 classes of land cover. 

2. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset was imaged by the AVIRIS in Indiana, USA, containing 200 bands and 16 classes of land cover.

3. **Pavia University Dataset**: This dataset was captured by the ROSIS in Pavia, Italy, containing 103 bands and 9 classes of land cover.

4. **Salinas Dataset**: This dataset was captured by AVIRIS in the Salinas Valley, California, USA, containing 204 bands and 16 classes of land cover.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically provide citations for the datasets they use, which is crucial for proper attribution.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For the **Chikusei Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Toyokawa, H., & Yokoya, N. (2018). *Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes*. Retrieved from https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.

- For the **Indian Pines Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Plaza, A., & Chang, C. I. (2007). *Indian Pines Dataset*. Retrieved from http://naotoyokoya.com/Download.html.

- For the **Pavia University Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Melgani, F., & Bruzzone, L. (2004). *Pavia University Dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 42(8), 1778-1790.

- For the **Salinas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landgrebe, D. A. (2003). *Salinas Dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 41(3), 517-526.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
