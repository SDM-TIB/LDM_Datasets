To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simba: Mamba augmented U-ShiftGCN for Skeletal Action Recognition in Videos" by Soumyabrata Chaudhuri and Saumik Bhattacharya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments & Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D**: This dataset is described as a prominent benchmark for skeleton-based human action recognition, comprising 56,880 skeletal action sequences captured by three Microsoft Kinect-V2 depth sensors. The evaluation is conducted using two benchmarks: Cross-Subject (X-Sub) and Cross-View (X-View).

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: This dataset extends the NTU RGB+D dataset by including an additional 57,367 skeleton sequences across 60 action classes, making it the largest dataset with 3D joint annotations for human action recognition.

3. **Northwestern-UCLA**: This dataset consists of 1,494 video sequences across 10 action categories, captured by three Kinect sensors from various viewpoints.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NTU RGB+D**, the citation is:
  > Liu, J., Shahroudy, A., Perez, M., Wang, G., Duan, L.Y., Kot, A.C. (2020). *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10), 2684–2701. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2916873

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is the same as above since it is an extension of the NTU RGB+D dataset.

- For **Northwestern-UCLA**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Nie, X., Xia, Y., Wu, Y., Zhu, S.C. (2014). *Cross-view action modeling, learning and recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2649–2656.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
