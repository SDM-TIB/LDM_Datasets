To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Trust without regulation! European challenge on regulation, liability and standards for trusted AI" by Fran√ßois Terrier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction often provide a summary of the key points, including any datasets that may be referenced.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail datasets, such as **methodology or experiments**. In this paper, the focus is on the regulatory and safety aspects of AI rather than on empirical experiments that typically involve datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to any references to data sources or case studies that might imply the use of datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will note any mentions of datasets or data sources, including their names and descriptions. If the paper discusses specific projects or initiatives that involve data collection or analysis, I will identify those as potential datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets or data sources mentioned in the text. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset.

In this particular paper, there are no explicit datasets mentioned, but there are references to various initiatives and projects related to AI safety and regulation. I will summarize these initiatives and check if they have associated datasets that can be cited.

For example, the paper mentions the **Confiance.ai** program, which is a national initiative on trust in critical systems. I will look for any publicly available datasets associated with this program.

Once I have identified any datasets or data sources, I will ensure to write down their full citations accurately. If a dataset is derived from a project or initiative, I will cite the original source or paper that describes the dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, complete with proper citations.
