To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ContactNet: Geometric-Based Deep Learning Model for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions" by Matan Halfon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that ContactNet was trained on docked antigen and modeled antibody structures, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section A.1 (Dataset preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention using a dataset of approximately 1,800 antibody-antigen complexes from the **AbDb dataset**. After filtering, they ended up with 1,214 complexes for their study. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and the criteria used for selection.

In addition, the authors validated their method using **32 unbound antibody-antigen complexes from the docking Benchmark 5.0**. This indicates that there are two distinct datasets being utilized in their research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **AbDb dataset**, the citation is:
   > Saba Ferdous and Andrew CR Martin. *Abdb: antibody structure database—a database of pdb-derived antibody structures*. Database, 2018.

2. For the **Benchmark 5.0 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Howook Hwang, Thom Vreven, Joël Janin, and Zhiping Weng. *Protein–protein docking benchmark version 4.0*. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 78(15):3111–3114, 2010.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **AbDb dataset**: A dataset of approximately 1,800 antibody-antigen complexes, filtered to 1,214 complexes based on specific criteria.
2. **Benchmark 5.0 dataset**: A set of 32 unbound antibody-antigen complexes used for validation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
