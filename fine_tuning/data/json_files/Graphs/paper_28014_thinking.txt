To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Component Function in Product Assemblies with Graph Neural Networks" by Vincenzo Ferrero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a design repository, specifically the **Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the OSDR. They mention that the OSDR is a structured taxonomy-based data source, which indicates that it is a significant dataset for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 3.1 (Data Selection and Processing)**, the authors provide detailed information about the OSDR. They state that the OSDR contains data from **160 consumer products** and **15,636 data points** related to component functions and flows. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific metrics about its size and structure.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or examples related to the datasets. In **Appendix A**, there is a table that provides an example of the data structure within the OSDR, which further illustrates the dataset's content.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The citation for the OSDR is not explicitly provided in the references, but the authors refer to it multiple times throughout the paper. Therefore, I will use the following citation format based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR)**, the citation is:
  > Ferrero, V., DuPont, B., Hassani, K., & Grandi, D. (2021). *Classifying Component Function in Product Assemblies with Graph Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the 2021 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2021), August 17-20, 2021, Virtual, Online. DOI: DETC2021-70840.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and its citation for clarity and future reference. The OSDR is the primary dataset used in this research, and its citation is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work or analysis.
