To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Cross-Modal Recipe Embeddings with Large Batch Training" by Jing Yang, Junwen Chen, and Keiji Yanai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed framework achieves high performance on the benchmark **Recipe1M**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention using the **Recipe1M dataset** for their experiments, detailing that they used 238,999 image-recipe pairs for training, 51,119 pairs for validation, and 51,303 pairs for testing. This confirms that Recipe1M is the primary dataset utilized in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Recipe1M dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Recipe1M dataset**:
  > Marin, J., Biswas, A., Oﬂi, F., Hynes, N., Salvador, A., Aytar, Y., Weber, I., Torralba, A. (2019). *Recipe1m+: A dataset for learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(1), 187–203.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Recipe1M
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 238,999 image-recipe pairs used for training, 51,119 pairs for validation, and 51,303 pairs for testing in cross-modal recipe retrieval tasks.
   - **Full Citation**: Marin, J., Biswas, A., Oﬂi, F., Hynes, N., Salvador, A., Aytar, Y., Weber, I., Torralba, A. (2019). *Recipe1m+: A dataset for learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(1), 187–203.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
