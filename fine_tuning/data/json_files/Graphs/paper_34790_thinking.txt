To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making" by Vivek Myers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **synthetic benchmark** for controlled settings and the **AntMaze benchmark suite** for evaluating their method. I will note these datasets and gather any additional details provided in the text.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers to locate the original sources.

1. **Synthetic Benchmark**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the synthetic benchmark, as it is likely a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research. I will note that it is a controlled synthetic environment used for testing properties like combinatorial generalization.

2. **AntMaze Benchmark Suite**: The citation for the AntMaze benchmark is:
   > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
