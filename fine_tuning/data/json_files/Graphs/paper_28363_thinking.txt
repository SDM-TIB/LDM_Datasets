To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Point Cloud Simplification: A Learnable Feature Preserving Approach" by Rolandos-Alexandros Potamias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **TOSCA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 80 synthetic meshes with 9 different deformable objects, making it a standard benchmark for evaluating simplification methods. The authors mention that it includes high-resolution meshes with a varying number of vertices between 10K to 50K.

2. **ModelNet10 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its popularity and was preprocessed to remove redundant points, retaining only high-resolution meshes with more than 2K vertices. The authors used the official train-test split for their experiments.

3. **MeIn3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10K meshes formed from distinct human faces, each with 28,431 vertices. The authors used a 10% training and 90% testing split for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TOSCA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bronstein AM, Bronstein MM, Kimmel R. *Numerical geometry of non-rigid shapes*. Springer Science & Business Media, 2008.

- For the **ModelNet10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu Z, Song S, Khosla A, et al. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, pp. 1912–1920.

- For the **MeIn3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Booth J, Roussos A, Ponniah A, et al. *Large scale 3D morphable models*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2018, 126(2): 233–254.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
