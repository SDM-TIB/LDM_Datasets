To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Enhancement for Contrastive Multi-Behavior Recommendation" by Hongrui Xuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a well-known business review website in the US, covering various fields such as restaurants and shopping malls. It includes four types of user interactions: dislike, neutral, tip, and like.

2. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China. It includes user interactions such as page view, favorite, add-to-cart, and purchase.

3. **Retail Dataset**: This dataset pertains to online retail scenarios and includes interactions like tag-as-favorite, add-to-cart, and purchase.

The paper provides detailed statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, and types of interactive behaviors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used datasets in the field. Therefore, I will provide general references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, a common reference is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For the **Tmall Dataset**, it is often referenced in the context of e-commerce datasets, but a specific citation may not be available. A general reference could be:
  > Tmall Dataset. *Tmall E-commerce Data*. Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56.

- For the **Retail Dataset**, it is also a commonly used dataset in recommendation systems, but specific citation details may vary. A general reference could be:
  > Retail Dataset. *Online Retail Dataset*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
