To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusing Higher-order Features in Graph Neural Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Zhenyue Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on two large benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **NTU60**: This dataset is described as a widely-used benchmark for skeleton-based action recognition, containing 56,000 videos. The authors note that it presents challenges due to variations in viewpoints, skeleton sizes, and action similarities.

2. **NTU120**: This dataset is an extension of NTU60, featuring more camera angles and a larger number of subjects, resulting in 113,945 videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NTU60**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2016, 2016.

- For **NTU120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Lisboa Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex Kot Chichung. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2019.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
