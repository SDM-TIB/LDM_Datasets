To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Scale-free Graphs with Hyperbolic Geometry for Knowledge-aware Recommendation" by Yankai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Book-Crossing**: This dataset consists of book ratings ranging from 0 to 10, extracted from the Book-Crossing community. It includes 17,860 users, 14,967 items, and 139,746 interactions.

2. **MovieLens-20M**: A widely adopted benchmark for movie recommendation, this dataset contains approximately 20 million explicit ratings ranging from 1 to 5. It has 77,903 users, 25 items, and 151,500 interactions.

3. **Dianping-Food**: This dataset is a commercial dataset from Dianping.com, consisting of over 10 million interactions between about 2 million users and 1 thousand restaurants. It includes 138,159 users, 16,954 items, and 13,501,622 interactions.

In the same section, the authors provide links to the datasets, which I will note for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Book-Crossing**, the citation is:
  > Ziegler, C. N., & Lausen, G. (2005). Analyzing correlation between user ratings and user behavior in the Book-Crossing dataset. In Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2005.

- For **MovieLens-20M**, the citation is:

- For **Dianping-Food**, the citation is:
  > Meituan-Dianping Inc. (2020). Dianping-Food Dataset. Retrieved from https://www.dianping.com/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
