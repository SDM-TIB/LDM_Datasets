To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Unrolled Federated Learning" by Samar Hadou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention a **meta-training dataset** consisting of 600 class-imbalanced datasets, each containing 6,000 images. This indicates that there is a specific dataset structure that I need to detail.

I will also check the **numerical experiments section** for any additional datasets or specific details about the datasets used. The authors mention that the experiments were conducted on the **CIFAR10 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Meta-training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 class-imbalanced datasets, each containing 6,000 images, with 45 training examples and 15 testing examples per agent.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR10 dataset is commonly cited, and I will ensure to include its citation as well.

The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

For the meta-training dataset, since it is a custom dataset created for the experiments, I will note that it is described in the paper but does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
