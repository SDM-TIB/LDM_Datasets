To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Functional Graph Contrastive Learning of Hyperscanning EEG Reveals Emotional Contagion Evoked by Stereotype-Based Stressors" by Jingyun Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on emotional contagion and EEG-based hyperscanning, which suggests that there may be datasets related to EEG recordings or experimental conditions.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss emotional contagion and its measurement, but I need to find explicit references to datasets. I will pay attention to any sections that describe the experimental setup or data collection methods.

In the **methods section**, I will focus on the details of the participants, the experimental design, and the data collection process. The authors mention that 18 female participants were involved, and they were paired into dyads for the study. This indicates that there may be a dataset related to the EEG recordings from these participants during the collaborative tasks.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to specific datasets used for analysis. The authors discuss the classification tasks and the performance of different models, which may imply the existence of datasets used for training and testing these models.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation details.

Based on my reading, I anticipate identifying the following datasets:

1. **EEG Data from Dyadic Interactions**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 18 female participants during collaborative problem-solving tasks. The authors mention that the data was collected using an ActiveTwo head cap and the BioSemi system, which provides details about the data collection method.

2. **Feedback Trials Dataset**: This dataset includes the EEG signals locked to feedback presentations (CORRECT or WRONG) during the math tasks. The authors specify that they only consider feedback trials for their analyses, indicating a focused dataset for emotional response evaluation.

Next, I will look for full citations for these datasets. If the authors have published the EEG data or if they reference any established datasets, I will include those citations.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset used in the study.
