To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOOMIN: Deep Molecular Omics Network for Anti-Cancer Drug Combination Therapy" by Benedek Rozemberczki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of finding synergistic drug combinations for cancer treatment, which suggests that they will reference specific datasets related to drug interactions and cancer cell lines.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Preliminaries)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **DrugCombDB**: This is a public dataset that contains 10,911 drug pairings, 987 unique drugs, and 110 cell lines from 14 source tissues. The dataset is used to evaluate the synergy of drug combinations.

2. **Drug-protein interaction graph**: This dataset includes 1,160 drugs and 17,582 human proteins with 232,524 edges, compiled from multiple sources including ChEMBL, CTD, and Hetionet, along with proprietary data from AstraZeneca.

In **section 3.2**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their structure and the types of information they contain. This section is crucial for understanding how the datasets are utilized in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **DrugCombDB**, the citation is:
> Liu, H., Zhang, W., Zou, B., Wang, J., Deng, Y., & Deng, L. (2020). DrugCombDB: A Comprehensive Database of Drug Combinations Toward the Discovery of Combinatorial Therapy. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 48(D1), D871–D881.

For the **ChEMBL dataset**, the citation is:
> Gaulton, A., Hersey, A., Nowotka, M., Bento, A. P., Chambers, J., Mendez, D., Mutowo, P., Atkinson, F., Bellis, L. J., Cibrián-Uhalte, E., Davies, M., Dedman, N., Karlsson, A., Magariños, M. P., Overington, J. P., Papadatos, G., Smit, I., & Leach, A. R. (2016). The ChEMBL Database in 2017. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 45(D1), D945–D954.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
