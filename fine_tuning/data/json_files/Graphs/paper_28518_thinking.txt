To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "InfoGCL: Information-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning" by Dongkuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their theoretical analysis on benchmark datasets for both node and graph classification tasks. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in **section 5.1 (Setup)**. They mention two categories of datasets: graph classification datasets and node classification datasets.

For the **graph classification datasets**, the paper lists the following:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset of 188 graphs representing nitroaromatic compounds, where vertices are atoms and edges are bonds.
2. **PTC-MR**: A dataset of 344 chemical compounds with labels indicating carcinogenicity for rats.
3. **IMDB-B**: A dataset of movie collaboration graphs where nodes are actors and edges represent co-appearances in movies.
4. **IMDB-M**: Similar to IMDB-B but includes more actors and collaborations.
5. **NCI1**: A dataset representing chemical compounds, with graphs where vertices are atoms and edges are bonds.
6. **COLLAB**: A dataset representing collaborations between researchers.

For the **node classification datasets**, the paper mentions:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with documents as nodes and citation links as edges.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset of scientific publications with citation links.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- **MUTAG**:

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Nino Shervashidze, Pascal Schweitzer, Erik Jan van Leeuwen, Kurt Mehlhorn, and Karsten M. Borgwardt. *Weisfeiler-lehman graph kernels*. J. Mach. Learn. Res, pages 2539–2561, 2011.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Nino Shervashidze, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, Tobias Petri, Kurt Mehlhorn, and Karsten M. Borgwardt. *Efficient graphlet kernels for large graph comparison*. In AISTATS, 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
