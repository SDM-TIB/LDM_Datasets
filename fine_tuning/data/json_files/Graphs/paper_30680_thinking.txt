To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Multi-Channel GNNs in Electrical Power Systems" by Qian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of a Chinese event detection dataset called **PoE**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **PoE Dataset**: This is a Chinese event detection dataset specifically designed for electrical power systems. The authors describe its characteristics, including the number of sentences, events, and tokens. They also provide statistical information about the dataset, such as the average sentence length and the distribution of event types.

2. **ACE 2005 Dataset**: This is a general-domain event detection dataset that is widely recognized in the field. The authors mention it as a benchmark for comparison in their experiments.

3. **MAVEN Dataset**: Another general-domain event detection dataset that the authors utilize for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PoE Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **ACE 2005 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MAVEN Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
