To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLDR: Contrastive Learning Drug Response Models from Natural Language Supervision" by Kun Li and Wenbin Hu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **experiments section** (Section 5) is likely to provide more information about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention validating their method on **GDSC2**, which is an updated version of the original GDSC dataset. This is important as it specifies the exact dataset version used for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if there are any references to other datasets that might have been used in previous studies or comparisons. The authors reference the **CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia)** dataset, which is another significant dataset in the field of drug response prediction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **GDSC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yang, W., Soares, J., Greninger, P., Edelman, E. J., Lightfoot, H., Forbes, S., Bindal, N., Beare, D., Smith, J. A., Thompson, I. R., Ramaswamy, S., Futreal, P. A., Haber, D. A., Stratton, M. R., Benes, C., McDermott, U., & Garnett, M. J. (2013). Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC): a resource for therapeutic biomarker discovery in cancer cells. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 41(Database issue), D955–D961.

2. For the **CCLE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Barretina, J., Caponigro, G., Stranksy, N., Venkatesan, K., & Al, E. (2012). The cancer cell line encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. *Nature*, 483(7391), 603–607.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets used in the research and their proper references for future use or analysis.
