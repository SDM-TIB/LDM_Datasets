To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Retrieval with WavText5K and CLAP Training" by Soham Deshmukh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new collection of web audio-text pairs referred to as **WavText5K**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the significance of this dataset in improving audio retrieval performance.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (WavText5K)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the WavText5K dataset. This section specifies that WavText5K consists of 4,525 audios, 4,348 descriptions, 4,525 audio titles, and 2,058 tags. It also describes the sources of the audio-text pairs, which are **BigSoundBank** and **SoundBible**. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition and its intended use.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets used for CLAP training, which include:

1. **WavText5K**: As previously mentioned, this dataset consists of audio-text pairs sourced from BigSoundBank and SoundBible.
2. **AudioCaps**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training and benchmarking. 
3. **Clotho**: Another dataset mentioned for training purposes.

I will now look for the full citations for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **WavText5K**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Soham Deshmukh, Benjamin Elizalde, Huaming Wang. *WavText5K: A Collection of Web Audio-Text Pairs for Audio Retrieval*. Microsoft, 2022. [Link to dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/WavText5K).

- For **AudioCaps**, the citation is:
  > Chris Dongjoo Kim, Byeongchang Kim, Hyunmin Lee, Gunhee Kim. *AudioCaps: Generating Captions for Audios in The Wild*. In NAACL-HLT, 2019.

- For **Clotho**, the citation is:
  > Konstantinos Drossos, Samuel Lipping, Tuomas Virtanen. *Clotho: an audio captioning dataset*. In ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020, pp. 736â€“740.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
