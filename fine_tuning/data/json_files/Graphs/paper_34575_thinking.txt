To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Language Meets the Skeleton: Progressively Distillation with Cross-Modal Knowledge for 3D Action Representation Learning" by Yang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60 predefined action categories and 56,880 action samples, including RGB, depth map, skeleton, and infrared (IR) video. The skeleton sequences represent a maximum of two human skeletons with 3D coordinates of 25 joints.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, it includes 120 predefined action categories and 114,480 action samples, maintaining the same modalities as the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset.

3. **PKU-MMD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 51 action categories and nearly 20,000 action samples, also featuring multiple modalities similar to the NTU datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2019.

- For **PKU-MMD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Chunhui, H. Yueyu, L. Yanghao, S. Sijie, and L. Jiaying. *PKU-MMD: A Large Scale Benchmark for Continuous Multi-Modal Human Action Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.07475, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
