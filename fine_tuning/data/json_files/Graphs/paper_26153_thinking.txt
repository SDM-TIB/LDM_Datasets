To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signed Graph Attention Networks" by Junjie Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on three real-world signed social network datasets. This is a strong indication that I will find detailed descriptions of these datasets here.

The paper lists the datasets as follows:

1. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: This dataset is derived from a website where users trade with Bitcoins. Users rate each other on a scale from -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust). The authors treat scores greater than 0 as positive links and others as negative links.

2. **Slashdot**: This dataset comes from a technology-related news website where users can tag each other as friends or foes, representing a signed social network.

3. **Epinions**: This dataset originates from a product review site where members can indicate their trust or distrust of others' reviews, reflecting people's opinions in a directed manner.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Bitcoin-Alpha**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, S., Spezzano, F., Subrahmanian, V., & Faloutsos, C. (2016). Edge weight prediction in weighted signed networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), 221–230. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2016.0033

- For **Slashdot**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Huttenlocher, D., & Kleinberg, J. (2010). Signed networks in social media. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems (pp. 1361–1370). ACM. https://doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753532

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Huttenlocher, D., & Kleinberg, J. (2010). Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks. In Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web (pp. 641–650). ACM. https://doi.org/10.1145/1772690.1772756

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
