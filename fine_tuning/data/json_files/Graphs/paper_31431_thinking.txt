To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Audio-Visual Source Localization via False Negative Aware Contrastive Learning" by Weixuan Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **Flickr-SoundNet**, **VGG-Sound**, and **AVSBench**, indicating that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly state that they train their model on **Flickr SoundNet** and **VGG-Sound**, and they also mention subsets of these datasets (10k and 144k paired samples).

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

1. **Flickr SoundNet**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. *Soundnet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 29, 2016.

2. **VGG-Sound**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 721â€“725. IEEE, 2020.

3. **AVSBench**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jinxing Zhou, Liang Zheng, Yiran Zhong, Shijie Hao, and Meng Wang. *Audio-visual segmentation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
