To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-similarity Prior Distillation for Unsupervised Remote Physiological Measurement" by Xinyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments on four commonly used open-access benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **PURE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 persons with 6 different head motion types. The authors refer to it as a commonly used benchmark for remote physiological measurement.

2. **UBFC-rPPG Dataset**: This dataset comprises 42 subjects who participated in a mathematical game to elicit non-stationary heart rates. The authors follow a specific protocol for splitting the training and test sets.

3. **VIPL-HR Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale benchmark containing 9 scenarios for 107 subjects, which includes various head movements and illumination changes.

4. **MR-NIRP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8 subjects and includes two experiments (still and motion), making it challenging due to the low intensity of the rPPG signals in near-infrared videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PURE Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
