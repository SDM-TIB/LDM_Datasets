To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Representation Learning in Visually-Rich Documents" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a framework for relational understanding in visually-rich documents, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of their proposed methods.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocol)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned and take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **RVL-CDIP**: This dataset consists of 400,000 gray-scale images categorized into 16 classes, with a breakdown of training, validation, and test images.

2. **DocBank**: This dataset contains 500,000 document pages with fine-grained token-level annotations for document layout analysis, also with specified splits for training, validation, and testing.

3. **ReadingBank**: A benchmark dataset for reading order detection, containing 500,000 document images with corresponding reading order information.

4. **SciTSR**: A large-scale table structure recognition dataset with 15,000 tables in PDF format and their corresponding structure labels.

5. **ICDAR-2013**: This dataset includes 156 tables collected from digital documents, with a specified method for training and testing splits.

6. **ICDAR-2019**: This dataset contains 600 tables for training and 150 for testing, annotated with bounding boxes and contents.

7. **FUNSD**: A dataset consisting of 199 fully annotated scanned form images, with a specified training and testing split.

8. **CORD**: A dataset of receipts collected from shops and restaurants, with specified splits for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
