To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning of Shared Spatiotemporal EEG Representations Across Individuals for Naturalistic Neuroscience" by Xinke Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes three EEG datasets, which is a good starting point for my search.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. The authors mention three datasets: 

1. **Synthetic EEG Dataset**: This dataset is generated for the purpose of the study and is described in detail in the Methods section. It includes inter-subject shared responses and subject-specific noise, which are crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

2. **Naturalistic Audio Speech EEG Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being published by Broderick et al. (2019). The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of subjects and the nature of the stimuli (listening to an audiobook).

3. **Emotional Video EEG Dataset (FACED)**: This dataset is mentioned as being collected from subjects watching emotional video clips. The authors also provide a reference to the original paper by Chen et al. (2023) that describes this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Naturalistic Audio Speech EEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Broderick, M. P., Anderson, A. J., Di Liberto, G. M., Crosse, M. J., & Lalor, E. C. (2019). Electrophysiological correlates of semantic dissimilarity reflect the comprehension of natural, narrative speech. Curr. Biol., 28(5), 803-809.e3. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.070JC

- For the **Emotional Video EEG Dataset (FACED)**, the citation is:
  > Chen, J., et al. (2023). A large finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset. Sci. Data, 10, 740. 

The **Synthetic EEG Dataset** does not have a formal citation since it is generated for the study, but I will note its significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details from the paper.
