To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Social Situation Awareness in Support Agents" by Ilir Kola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction. Here, the authors discuss the need for support agents to understand social situations but do not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors discuss empirical evidence and refer to previous studies, which may include datasets. I will pay close attention to any citations or references to datasets in these sections.

Upon reviewing the **empirical evidence** section, I find that the authors reference several studies that may have utilized datasets. Specifically, they mention works by Kola et al. (2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2021) and Rauthmann et al. (2014). I will need to check these references to see if they include datasets.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations of the studies mentioned. For example, Kola et al. (2019) discusses social situation awareness and may have utilized a dataset for their user study. I will extract the full citation for this paper, as well as any others that are relevant.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets identified in the paper along with their full citations. If specific datasets are not named but are implied through the references, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation in a consistent format, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology and experiments sections for explicit dataset references.
3. Review the empirical evidence section for citations of studies that may contain datasets.
4. Check the references section for full citations of those studies.
5. Compile the dataset information with full citations for each identified dataset.
