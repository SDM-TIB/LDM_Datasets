To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the Symmetry: Resolving Symmetry Ambiguities in Equivariant Neural Networks" by Sidhika Balachandar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the relevance of 3-D representations and mention various tasks in computer vision and robotics. I will look for any specific datasets referenced in relation to these tasks.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experiments conducted. The authors mention testing their model using a left-right segmentation experiment on symmetric airplane objects from the **Shapenet dataset**. This indicates that the Shapenet dataset is one of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that may be mentioned. The authors discuss their findings based on the experiments conducted, and they may refer to other datasets or provide details about the Shapenet dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the Shapenet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the Shapenet dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details from the paper.
