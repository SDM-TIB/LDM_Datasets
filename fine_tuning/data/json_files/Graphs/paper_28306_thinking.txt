To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PLATO-XL: Exploring the Large-scale Pre-training of Dialogue Generation" by Siqi Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that PLATO-XL is trained on both Chinese and English social media conversations, which suggests that there are datasets involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any specific datasets used for training and evaluation. In **section 4.3 (Explorations on other Conversational Tasks)**, the authors describe three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **DuConv**: This dataset is a Chinese knowledge grounded conversation dataset collected in LUGE, focusing on proactive conversations towards pre-defined goals. It includes 30K dialogues based on movie knowledge graphs.

2. **DSTC9-Track1**: This dataset aims to incorporate external knowledge resources to respond to user queries. It augments the dataset of MultiWOZ 2.1 with 22K knowledge grounded conversation turns.

3. **MultiWOZ 2.2**: This is a polished version of MultiWOZ 2.1, which includes 10K task-oriented conversations across multiple domains.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DuConv**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Zhang, Y., & Huang, M. (2019). DuConv: A Chinese Knowledge Grounded Conversation Dataset. In Proceedings of the LUGE Workshop.

- For **DSTC9-Track1**, the citation is:
  > Kim, S., Eric, M., Gopalakrishnan, K., Hedayatnia, B., Liu, Y., & Hakkani-Tur, D. (2020). Beyond Domain APIs: Task-oriented Conversational Modeling with Unstructured Knowledge Access. In Proceedings of the 21th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue.

- For **MultiWOZ 2.2**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
