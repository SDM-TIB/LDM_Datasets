To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Legal Element-oriented Modeling with Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Legal Case Retrieval" by Zhaowei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a benchmark for relevant case retrieval, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention two datasets:

1. **CAIL2019-SCM**: This dataset is used for legal case retrieval and contains 8,964 triplets of cases published by the Supreme Peopleâ€™s Court of China. The authors state that the participants are required to determine which two cases are more relevant in the triplets. The average length of cases in this dataset is 676 words.

2. **CAIL2019-FE**: This dataset is used for the auxiliary task of learning the legal element knowledge-aware indicator. It focuses on extracting elements from three different kinds of cases, including divorce disputes, labor disputes, and loan disputes. The authors specifically mention using the loan dispute data to match the domain of CAIL2019-SCM.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CAIL2019-SCM**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, C., Zhong, H., Guo, Z., Tu, C., Liu, Z., Sun, M., Zhang, T., Han, X., Hu, Z., Wang, H., et al. (2019). *CAIL2019-SCM: A dataset of similar case matching in legal domain*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08962.

- For **CAIL2019-FE**, the citation is:
  > Shu, Y., Zhao, Y., Zeng, X., & Ma, Q. (2019). *CAIL2019-FE*. Tech. Rep.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
