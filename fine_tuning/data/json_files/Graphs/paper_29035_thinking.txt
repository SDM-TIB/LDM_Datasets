To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Movies2Scenes: Using Movie Metadata to Learn Scene Representation" by Shixing Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "newly collected movie dataset, we present comparative results of our scene representation on a set of video moderation tasks," indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **MovieCL30K**: This dataset is compiled from 30,340 movies across 11 genres. The authors provide details about the genre distribution and the methodology used to collect movie co-watch information.

2. **Mature Content Dataset (MCD)**: This dataset consists of 44,581 video clips from 18,330 movies and TV episodes, focusing on sensitive activities such as sex, violence, and drug use. The authors describe how the dataset was annotated and the distribution of clips across different categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **MovieCL30K**, the citation is:
> Chen, S., Liu, C., Hao, X., Nie, X., Arap, M., & Hamid, R. (2022). Movies2Scenes: Using Movie Metadata to Learn Scene Representation. *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

For **Mature Content Dataset (MCD)**, the citation is:
> Chen, S., Liu, C., Hao, X., Nie, X., Arap, M., & Hamid, R. (2022). Movies2Scenes: Using Movie Metadata to Learn Scene Representation. *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
