To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELCoRec: Enhance Language Understanding with Co-Propagation of Numerical and Categorical Features for Recommendation" by Kounianhua Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **ML-1M**: This dataset is a collection of 1 million movie ratings from the MovieLens website, commonly used in recommendation research.

2. **ML-25M**: This is a larger dataset containing 25 million interactions on movies from 1995 to 2019, also from the MovieLens website.

3. **BookCrossing**: This dataset includes user ratings for books, along with demographic information, gathered from the BookCrossing community.

The paper provides a brief description of each dataset, including the number of users, items, and samples, which is essential for understanding their scope and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ML-1M**:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

- For **ML-25M**:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 25M Dataset*. Available at: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip

- For **BookCrossing**:
  > Ziegler, C. N., & Lausen, G. (2005). *An Introduction to the BookCrossing Dataset*. Available at: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
