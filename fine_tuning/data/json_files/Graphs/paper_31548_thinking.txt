To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimTS: Rethinking Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Forecasting" by Xiaochen Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several benchmark time series forecasting datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they list the datasets and provide some details about each one.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT)**: This dataset is divided into two hourly-sampled datasets (ETTh1 and ETTh2) and two 15-minute-sampled datasets (ETTm1 and ETTm2). It measures the long-term deployment of electric power and contains various features related to temperature and power load.

2. **Exchange Rate**: This dataset contains daily exchange rates of eight foreign countries from 1990 to 2016, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.

3. **Weather**: This dataset consists of local climatological data for almost 1,600 U.S. areas collected every 10 minutes over four years. It includes multiple weather variables and a target feature, 'Wet Bulb Celsius'.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Zhou, H., Zhang, S., Peng, J., Zhang, S., Li, J., Xiong, H., & Zhang, W. (2021). Informer: Beyond efficient transformer for long sequence time-series forecasting. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 11106–11115.

- For the **Exchange Rate** dataset, the citation is:
  > Lai, G., Chang, W.-C., Yang, Y., & Liu, H. (2018). Modeling long-and short-term temporal patterns with deep neural networks. In The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval, 95–104.

- For the **Weather** dataset, the citation is:
  > BGC-Jena. (n.d.). Local climatological data for U.S. areas. Retrieved from https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
