To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Crystal Structure Prediction from Powder X-Ray Diffraction" by Qingsi Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, **hMOF-100** and **hMOF-400**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Results section**, particularly **section 2.2 (Dataset Preparing and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they explain how the datasets were curated based on hypothetical metal-organic frameworks (hMOFs) and specify the number of atoms in the unit cell for each dataset:

1. **hMOF-100 Dataset**: This dataset includes materials with 100 or fewer atoms in the unit cell, with a breakdown of the dataset into training (73,332), validation (9,117), and test (9,081) sets.

2. **hMOF-400 Dataset**: This dataset comprises materials with 400 or fewer atoms in the unit cell, also divided into training (109,836), validation (13,730), and test (13,729) sets.

The authors also mention that the original hMOFs database lacked PXRD patterns, and they simulated PXRD patterns for each crystal in the dataset using GSAS software.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) are likely original contributions of the authors and may not have separate citations, I will note that they are derived from hypothetical frameworks as described in the paper.

The relevant citations for the methods used to generate the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset as described in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
