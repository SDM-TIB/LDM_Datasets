To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProGCL: Rethinking Hard Negative Mining in Graph Contrastive Learning" by Jun Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention seven datasets: **Amazon-Photo, Amazon-Computers, Wiki-CS, Coauthor-CS, Reddit, Flickr, and ogbn-arXiv**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the tasks they are used for.

For each dataset, I will look for the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of nodes, edges, classes).
3. **Full Citation**: I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution.

Here are the datasets I will extract along with their citations:

1. **Amazon-Photo**: A network of co-purchase relationships from Amazon, where nodes are goods and edges represent frequent co-purchases.
   - Citation: Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

2. **Amazon-Computers**: Similar to Amazon-Photo, this dataset consists of co-purchase relationships among computer products.
   - Citation: Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

3. **Wiki-CS**: A reference network constructed from Wikipedia articles about computer science, with nodes as articles and edges as hyperlinks.
   - Citation: Mernyei, P., & Cangea, C. (2020). *Wiki-cs: A wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02901.

4. **Coauthor-CS**: An academic network based on co-authorship relationships from the Microsoft Academic Graph.
   - Citation: Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

5. **Flickr**: A dataset representing images uploaded to Flickr, where edges connect images sharing common properties.
   - Citation: Hamilton, W. L., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Representation learning on graphs: Methods and applications*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.05584.

6. **Reddit**: A dataset of Reddit posts from September 2014, where nodes are posts and edges connect posts commented on by the same user.
   - Citation: Hamilton, W. L., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Representation learning on graphs: Methods and applications*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.05584.

7. **ogbn-arXiv**: A large-scale citation network of CS papers on arXiv, where nodes represent papers and edges indicate citations.
   - Citation: Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset as outlined in the paper.
