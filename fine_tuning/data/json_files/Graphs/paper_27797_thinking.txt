To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergent Graph Solvers" by Junyoung Park, Jinhyun Choo, and Jinkyoo Park, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to validate the proposed method. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

For example, if the authors describe datasets like "Physical Diffusion in Networks" or "Graph Value Iteration," I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their purpose, structure, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this study.
