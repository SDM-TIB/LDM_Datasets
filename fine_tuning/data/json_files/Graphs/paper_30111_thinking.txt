To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MolGraph: a Python package for the implementation of molecular graphs and graph neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras" by Alexander Kensert et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmarked their GNNs against datasets from **MoleculeNet** and three chromatographic retention time datasets. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for validation. They mention using **15 datasets from MoleculeNet**, one dataset referred to as **SMRT** from Domingo-Almenara et al., and two datasets referred to as **RPLC** and **HILIC** from Bonini et al. This gives me a clear list of datasets to extract.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

1. **MoleculeNet**: The citation is:
   > Zhenqin Wu, Bharath Ramsundar, Evan N Feinberg, Joseph Gomes, Caleb Geniesse, Aneesh S Pappu, Karl Leswing, and Vijay Pande. *Moleculenet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513–530, 2018.

2. **SMRT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Xavier Domingo-Almenara, Carlos Guijas, Elizabeth Billings, J Rafael Montenegro-Burke, Winnie Uritboonthai, Aries E Aisporna, Emily Chen, H Paul Benton, and Gary Siuzdak. *The metlin small molecule dataset for machine learning-based retention time prediction*. Nature Communications, 10(1):1–9, 2019.

3. **RPLC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Paolo Bonini, Tobias Kind, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Dinesh Kumar Barupal, and Oliver Fiehn. *Retip: retention time prediction for compound annotation in untargeted metabolomics*. Analytical Chemistry, 92(11):7515–7522, 2020.

4. **HILIC Dataset**: The citation is the same as for the RPLC dataset, as it is part of the same study.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
