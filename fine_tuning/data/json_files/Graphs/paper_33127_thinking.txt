To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VertDetect: Fully End-to-End 3D Vertebral Instance Segmentation Model" by Geoff Klein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **VerSe 2019 and VerSe 2020 datasets** for evaluating the proposed model, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. In this case, I will check **section 6 (Implementation)**, where the authors describe the training and testing datasets. Here, they mention that the model was trained on the merged **VerSe 2019 and 2020 datasets**, which consist of 141 training, 120 validation, and 113 testing samples.

I will also look for any additional details about these datasets, such as their structure, content, and any specific characteristics that might be relevant for understanding their use in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the VerSe datasets, which are associated with specific papers. I will ensure to include the correct citations for these datasets.

The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **VerSe 2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sekuboyina, A., Husseini, M.E., Bayat, A., Löffler, M., Liebl, H., Li, H., Tetteh, G., Kukačka, J., Payer, C., Stern, D., Urschler, M., Chen, M., Cheng, D., Lessmann, N., Hu, Y., Wang, T., Yang, D., Xu, D., Ambellan, F., Amiranashvili, T., Ehlke, M., Lamecker, H., Lehnert, S., Lirio, M., Olaguer, N.P.d., Ramm, H., Sahu, M., Tack, A., Zachow, S., Jiang, T., Ma, X., Angerman, C., Wang, X., Brown, K., Kirszenberg, A., Puybareau, É., 2020. VerSe: A vertebrae labelling and segmentation benchmark. *Medical Image Analysis*, 75, 102258. doi:10.1016/j.media.2021.102258.

- For the **VerSe 2020 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sekuboyina, A., Bayat, A., Husseini, M.E., Löffler, M., Liebl, H., Tetteh, G., Kukačka, J., Payer, C., Stern, D., Urschler, M., Chen, M., Cheng, D., Lessmann, N., Hu, Y., Wang, T., Yang, D., Xu, D., Ambellan, F., Zachow, S., Jiang, T., Ma, X., Angerman, C., Wang, X., Brown, K., Kirszenberg, A., Puybareau, É., 2021. VERSE: A Vertebrae labelling and segmentation benchmark for multi-detector CT images. *Medical Image Analysis*, 75, 102258. doi:10.1016/j.media.2021.102166.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work or analyses.
