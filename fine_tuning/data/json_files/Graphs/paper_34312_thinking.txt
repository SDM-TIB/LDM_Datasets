To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Human Pose Estimation with Occlusions: Introducing BlendMimic3D Dataset and GCN Refinement" by Filipa Lino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **BlendMimic3D dataset**, which is specifically designed for 3D human pose estimation in occluded scenarios. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges in 3D human pose estimation, particularly with occlusions, and emphasize the need for datasets that address these issues. They mention the **BlendMimic3D dataset** again, reinforcing its significance.

In the **related work** section, the authors reference existing datasets such as **Human3.6M**, **SURREAL**, and **CMU Panoptic**. I will take note of these datasets as they are relevant to the context of the research.

The **datasets** section (which is likely to be found in the methodology or results sections) will provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find:

1. **BlendMimic3D**: This dataset is described as a synthetic benchmark for 3D human pose estimation with occlusions. It includes various scenarios and types of occlusions, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating models.

2. **Human3.6M**: A well-known dataset in the field, it contains 3.6 million human poses captured in controlled environments. This dataset is often used as a benchmark for 3D human pose estimation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **BlendMimic3D**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Filipa Lino, Carlos Santiago, Manuel Marques. *3D Human Pose Estimation with Occlusions: Introducing BlendMimic3D Dataset and GCN Refinement*. Accepted at 6th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild, CVPR 2024 Workshop.

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325â€“1339, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
