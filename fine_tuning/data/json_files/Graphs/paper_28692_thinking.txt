To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CDGNet: A Cross-Time Dynamic Graph-based Deep Learning Model for Traffic Forecasting" by Yuchen Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "three real-world public traffic datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in **section 6.1.1 (Datasets)**, where they list three datasets: **METR-LA**, **PEMS-BAY**, and **PEMSD4**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, time slices, and the timespan of the data.

Here are the details I will extract:

1. **METR-LA**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 207
   - Number of Edges: 1515
   - Number of Time Slices: 34272
   - Timespan: 3/1/2012 - 6/30/2012

2. **PEMS-BAY**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 325
   - Number of Edges: 2369
   - Number of Time Slices: 52116
   - Timespan: 1/1/2017 - 5/31/2017

3. **PEMSD4**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 307
   - Number of Edges: 340
   - Number of Time Slices: 16992
   - Timespan: 1/1/2018 - 2/28/2018

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **METR-LA** and **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Yu Zheng, L. Zhang, Y. Xie, and W. Yang. *Forecasting taxi demand using big data*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, pages 1-8, 2015.

- For **PEMSD4**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting*. In 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada, April 30 - May 3, 2018, Conference Track Proceedings.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, complete with proper citations for future reference.
