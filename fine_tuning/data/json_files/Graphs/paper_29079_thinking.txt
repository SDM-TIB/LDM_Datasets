To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridge the Gap between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Fine-Grained Classification" by Jiabao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention six datasets: **CUB-200-2011, Oxford-Flowers, Oxford-Pets, Stanford-Dogs, Stanford-Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of classes, training examples, testing examples, and total images.

In the **table provided in section IV**, I will extract the relevant statistics for each dataset:
1. **CUB-200-2011**: 200 classes, 5,994 training examples, 5,794 testing examples, 11,788 total images.
2. **Oxford-Flowers**: 102 classes, 2,040 training examples, 6,149 testing examples, 8,189 total images.
3. **Oxford-Pets**: 37 classes, 3,680 training examples, 3,669 testing examples, 7,349 total images.
4. **Stanford-Dogs**: 120 classes, 12,000 training examples, 8,580 testing examples, 20,580 total images.
5. **Stanford-Cars**: 196 classes, 8,144 training examples, 8,041 testing examples, 16,158 total images.
6. **FGVC-Aircraft**: 100 classes, 6,667 training examples, 3,333 testing examples, 10,000 total images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- **CUB-200-2011**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
