To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RDF-star2Vec: RDF-star Graph Embeddings for Data Mining" by Shusaku Egami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset and a benchmarking framework for data mining tasks focused on complex RDF-star graphs. This indicates that there are datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss the methodology and experiments. In the **dataset section**, the authors introduce the **KGRC-RDF-star** dataset, which is derived from the KGRC-RDF dataset. They describe it as a complex RDF-star dataset constructed for benchmarking RDF-star embeddings.

In the **dataset section**, the authors provide details about the KGRC-RDF-star dataset, including its origin and structure. They mention that it is based on mystery stories and contains nested statements and scenes. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed RDF-star2Vec method.

Additionally, the authors mention the construction of **four gold standard datasets** for various evaluation tasks, including classification, clustering, entity relatedness, and QT similarity tasks. These datasets are derived from the KGRC-RDF-star dataset and are designed to facilitate benchmarking.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **KGRC-RDF-star Dataset**: The citation for the original KGRC-RDF dataset is:
   > T. Kawamura, S. Egami, K. Matsushita, T. Ugai, K. Fukuda, and K. Kozaki. *Contextualized scene knowledge graphs for XAI benchmarking*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs, 2022, pp. 1â€“9.

2. **Gold Standard Datasets**: The authors do not provide specific citations for the gold standard datasets in the references, but they are derived from the KGRC-RDF-star dataset. Therefore, I will reference the KGRC-RDF-star dataset citation for these as well.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the KGRC-RDF-star dataset and the associated gold standard datasets used for evaluation tasks.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
