To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Graph Convolutional Network Training with GPU-Oriented Data Communication Architecture" by Seung Won Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list four datasets:

1. **ogbn-products**: This dataset is based on the Amazon co-purchasing network, where nodes represent products and edges indicate that products are purchased together. The dataset has 2.4 million nodes and 17.1 GB in size.

2. **wikipedia**: This dataset consists of the wikilinks of Wikipedia in the English language, where nodes are Wikipedia articles and directed edges are wikilinks. It has 61.9 million edges and a size of 14.7 GB.

3. **amazon**: This dataset is based on the Amazon product network connected by "also viewed" and "also bought" links. It contains 13.6 million nodes and 34.0 GB in size.

4. **ogbn-papers100M**: This dataset is a directed citation graph of 111 million papers indexed by MAG, with 1.6 billion edges and a size of 56.9 GB.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ogbn-products**, the citation is:

- For **wikipedia**, the citation is:

- For **amazon**, the citation is:

- For **ogbn-papers100M**, the citation is:
  > Wang, K., Shen, I., Huang, C., Wu, C.-H., Dong, Y., & Kanakia, A. (2020). Microsoft Academic Graph: when experts are not enough. Quantitative Science Studies, 1(1), 396–413. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
