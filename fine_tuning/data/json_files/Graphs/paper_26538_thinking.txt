To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-view Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Class Weighting Loss for Semantic Segmentation" by Qinghui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **Agriculture-Vision challenge dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In section III, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **Agriculture-Vision challenge dataset**. They mention that it consists of **21,061 aerial farmland images** captured throughout 2019 across the US, with annotations for seven classes. This section confirms that the dataset is used for evaluation and provides specific details about its structure and content.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Agriculture-Vision dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Agriculture-Vision challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mang Tik Chiu, Xingqian Xu, Yunchao Wei, Zilong Huang, Alexander Schwing, Robert Brunner, Hrant Khachatrian, Hovnatan Karapetyan, Ivan Dozier, Greg Rose, David Wilson, Adrian Tudor, Naira Hovakimyan, Thomas S. Huang, and Honghui Shi. *Agriculture-vision: A large aerial image database for agricultural pattern analysis*. 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset's name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for any downstream applications or reviews.
