To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GNN-LoFI: a Novel Graph Neural Network through Localized Feature-based Histogram Intersection" by Alessandro Bicciato et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using **seven widely used graph classification and regression datasets**. I will carefully note each dataset's name and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset for graph classification tasks involving molecular graphs.
2. **NCI1**: Another graph classification dataset related to molecular graphs.
3. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for classifying protein structures.
4. **PTC**: A dataset for graph classification involving chemical compounds.
5. **IMDB-B**: A dataset describing co-appearances of actors in movies for graph classification.
6. **IMDB-M**: Another dataset for co-appearances of actors in movies, also for graph classification.
7. **ZINC**: A dataset used for graph regression tasks, specifically for predicting drug solubility.

In the same section, the authors provide references for these datasets, which I will need to include in the citations. The references are as follows:

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > K. Kersting, N. M. Kriege, C. Morris, P. Mutzel, M. Neumann. *Benchmark data sets for graph kernels*. URL http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de (2016).

- For **NCI1**, the citation is:
  > P. Yanardag, S. Vishwanathan. *Deep graph kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015, pp. 1365–1374.

- For **PROTEINS**, the citation is:
  > N. Shervashidze, P. Schweitzer, E. J. Van Leeuwen, K. Mehlhorn, K. M. Borgwardt. *Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels*. Journal of Machine Learning Research 12 (9) (2011).

- For **PTC**, the citation is:
  > L. Ralaivola, S. J. Swamidass, H. Saigo, P. Baldi. *Graph kernels for chemical informatics*. Neural Networks 18 (8) (2005).

- For **IMDB-B** and **IMDB-M**, the citation is:
  > P. Yanardag, S. Vishwanathan. *Deep graph kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015, pp. 1365–1374.

- For **ZINC**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
