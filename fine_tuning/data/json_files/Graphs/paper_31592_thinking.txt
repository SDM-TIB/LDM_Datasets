To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAFIN: Centrality-Aware Fairness Inducing In-processing for Unsupervised Representation Learning on Graphs" by Arvindh Arun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for fairness in graph representation learning and mention that they evaluate their method on various datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets, including key characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 10,556 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 9,104 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Twitch**: A social network dataset with 7,126 nodes, 25,468 edges, and 202 features.
4. **Amazon Photos (AMZN-P)**: An e-commerce co-purchase network with 7,650 nodes, 238,162 edges, 745 features, and 8 classes.
5. **Amazon Computers (AMZN-C)**: Another e-commerce dataset with 13,752 nodes, 491,722 edges, 767 features, and 10 classes.
6. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: A collection of 24 graphs, with 56,658 nodes, 793,617 edges, 501 features, and 121 classes (multi-label).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Cora**:
  > McCallum, A., Nigam, K., Rennie, J. D. M., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3, 127–163.

- For **CiteSeer**:

- For **Amazon Photos (AMZN-P)** and **Amazon Computers (AMZN-C)**:

- For **PPI**:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33(14), i190–i198.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented along with its source.
