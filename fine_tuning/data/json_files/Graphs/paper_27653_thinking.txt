To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Scalable Semi-supervised Landmark Localization for X-ray Images using Few-shot Deep Adaptive Graph" by Xiao-Yun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large-scale labeled training data and the potential of using semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data. This suggests that the paper may utilize specific datasets for landmark localization tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. They mention validating their method on three X-ray datasets: **pelvis, hand, and chest**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as the number of labeled and unlabeled images, which are provided in the results section. The authors state that:
- The **pelvis dataset** consists of 60 labeled images and 5000 unlabeled images.
- The **hand dataset** consists of 36 labeled images and 3000 unlabeled images.
- The **chest dataset** consists of 60 labeled images and 5000 unlabeled images.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are not attributed to specific papers in the references. Instead, the authors mention that all datasets were collected from anonymous hospitals after de-identification of patient information. This means I may not have formal citations for these datasets, but I can still document their details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and any relevant details, ensuring that I note the lack of formal citations for the datasets since they were collected from hospitals.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **Pelvis Dataset**: 60 labeled images, 5000 unlabeled images.
2. **Hand Dataset**: 36 labeled images, 3000 unlabeled images.
3. **Chest Dataset**: 60 labeled images, 5000 unlabeled images.

Since there are no formal citations available for these datasets, I will note that they were collected from anonymous hospitals. This will be important for transparency in the dataset documentation.
