To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Modeling as Multi-Objective Contrastive Optimization" by Thong Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our model on" or "the datasets used include."

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. The authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details such as the number of documents, types of documents, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention four benchmark datasets used for their experiments:

1. **20Newsgroups (20NG)**: A well-known dataset consisting of 18,000 documents across 20 different newsgroups.
2. **IMDb**: A dataset of movie reviews categorized into positive and negative sentiment labels.
3. **Wikitext-103 (Wiki)**: A dataset comprising 28,500 articles from Wikipedia's Good and Featured sections.
4. **AG News**: A dataset containing news articles with a training set of 30,000 articles and a testing set of 1,900 articles.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **20Newsgroups**:
  > Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Machine Learning Proceedings 1995* (pp. 331-339). Elsevier.

- For **IMDb**:

- For **Wikitext-103**:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. In *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* (pp. 919-927).

  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In *Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 649-657).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference.
