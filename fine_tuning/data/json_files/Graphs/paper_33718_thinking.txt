To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASCENT: A Context-Aware Spectrum Coexistence Design and Implementation Toolset for Policymakers in Satellite Bands," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the ASCENT toolset and its capabilities, but it does not specify any datasets directly. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for spectrum sharing and the context-aware policies. While this section outlines the problem and the proposed solution, it does not mention specific datasets either.

Moving on to the **methodology and implementation sections**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the development or testing of the ASCENT tool. The paper mentions a case study involving the **12 GHz Ku-band** and discusses various components of the ASCENT tool, but it does not provide specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the evaluation of ASCENT under different weather conditions and its impact on interference analysis. However, they do not provide specific datasets used for these experiments. 

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the research. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not explicitly mention datasets that were utilized in the ASCENT tool development or testing.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors mention the use of external context providers and databases, such as OpenWeatherMap and OpenCellID, which may contain relevant data but are not datasets created or published by the authors themselves.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified in the paper.**
2. **External context providers mentioned:**
   - OpenWeatherMap (for weather data)
   - OpenCellID (for MBS geolocation data)

I will ensure to include this information in a structured format for clarity, but since there are no datasets with full citations to provide, I will focus on the context providers mentioned in the paper.
