To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Guided Improvement Heuristic for Job Shop Scheduling" by Cong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "classic benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention that they performed training on synthetic instances generated following the convention in Taillard (1993) and evaluated their method on seven widely used classic benchmarks. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

In section 5.1, the authors list the datasets used for evaluation:
1. **Taillard Benchmark**: A well-known benchmark for job shop scheduling problems, which includes various problem sizes and configurations.
2. **ABZ Benchmark**: Another classic benchmark dataset for job shop scheduling.
3. **FT Benchmark**: A benchmark dataset used for evaluating scheduling algorithms.
4. **LA Benchmark**: A dataset that is part of the job shop scheduling benchmarks.
5. **SWV Benchmark**: A dataset used for scheduling problems.
6. **ORB Benchmark**: Another benchmark dataset for job shop scheduling.
7. **YN Benchmark**: A dataset used for evaluating scheduling algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper effectively.
