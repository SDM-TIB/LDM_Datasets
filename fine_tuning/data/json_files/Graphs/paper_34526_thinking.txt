To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the False Sense of Security in Backdoor Defense through Re-Activation Attack" by Mingli Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are critical to their experiments. I will pay attention to any named datasets or benchmarks mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that detail the datasets used for training or testing. This section often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used, including the number of samples, types of tasks, and any preprocessing steps. This is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were applied.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets used in the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: 
     > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels.
   - Citation: 
     > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

3. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition, containing over 50,000 images of traffic signs.
   - Citation: 
     > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2011.

4. **CC3M (Conceptual Captions 3M)**: A dataset used for multimodal contrastive learning, consisting of 3 million image-caption pairs.
   - Citation: 
     > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-Text Dataset for Automatic Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2556â€“2565, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
