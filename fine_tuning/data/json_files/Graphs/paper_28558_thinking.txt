To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graph Embedding for Autonomous Vehicle Collision Prediction" by Arnav V. Malawade et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on synthesized datasets and a real-world collision dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors created two synthetic datasets, **271-syn** and **1043-syn**, generated using the CARLA simulator. They also mention a balanced version called **306-syn** derived from the 1043-syn dataset. The paper states that these datasets contain video clips of lane changes with specific collision and no-collision label distributions.

2. **Typical Real-World Driving Dataset**: This dataset is referred to as **571-honda**, which is a subset of the Honda Driving Dataset. It consists of 571 lane-change video clips recorded in real-world conditions.

3. **Complex Real-World Driving Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as **620-dash**, which contains challenging real-world collision scenarios drawn from the Detection of Traffic Anomaly dataset. This dataset includes a variety of driving actions and conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Honda Driving Dataset** (571-honda):
  > V. Ramanishka, Y.-T. Chen et al., “Toward driving scene understanding: A dataset for learning driver behavior and causal reasoning,” Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7699–7707, 2018.

- For the **Detection of Traffic Anomaly dataset** (620-dash):
  > Y. Yao, X. Wang et al., “When, where, and what? a new dataset for anomaly detection in driving videos,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.03044, 2020.

- For the **CARLA simulator** used to generate synthetic datasets:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros et al., “Carla: An open urban driving simulator,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
