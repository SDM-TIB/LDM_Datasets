To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EchoEA: Echo Information between Entities and Relations for Entity Alignment" by Xueyuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three real-world cross-lingual datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section V)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they employed three cross-lingual datasets: **ZH-EN (Chinese to English), JA-EN (Japanese to English), and FR-EN (French to English)** from DBP15K. This is a clear identification of the datasets relevant to their experiments.

I will also check the **statistical data table (Table I)** provided in the experiments section, which gives additional context about each dataset, including the number of entities, relations, attributes, and relation triples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scale and structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference DBP15K, which is a dataset commonly used for cross-lingual entity alignment tasks. The citation for DBP15K is:

- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Sun, Z., Hu, W., & Li, C. (2017). Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding. In ISWC 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ZH-EN Dataset**: A cross-lingual dataset for entity alignment from Chinese to English.
2. **JA-EN Dataset**: A cross-lingual dataset for entity alignment from Japanese to English.
3. **FR-EN Dataset**: A cross-lingual dataset for entity alignment from French to English.

Each dataset is part of the DBP15K collection, which is widely recognized in the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
