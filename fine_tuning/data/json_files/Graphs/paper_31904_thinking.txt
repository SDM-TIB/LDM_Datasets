To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge Directionality Improves Learning on Heterophilic Graphs" by Emanuele Rossi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their framework on several directed benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **CiteSeer-Full**: This dataset is commonly used for node classification tasks in graph neural networks.
2. **Cora-ML**: Another well-known dataset for evaluating graph-based models, particularly in the context of homophily.
3. **OGBN-Arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark, specifically designed for graph neural network tasks.
4. **Chameleon**: A dataset that is known for its heterophilic properties.
5. **Squirrel**: Similar to Chameleon, this dataset also exhibits heterophilic characteristics.
6. **Arxiv-Year**: A dataset used for predicting publication years based on citation networks.
7. **Snap-Patents**: A dataset related to patent citations.
8. **Roman-Empire**: A dataset that captures relationships in historical contexts.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. The paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset, but I can refer to commonly accepted sources for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
