To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bkd-FedGNN: A Benchmark for Classification Backdoor Attacks on Federated Graph Neural Network" by Fan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on **13 benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets and Models)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They categorize the datasets into two groups: **node-level datasets** and **graph-level datasets**. 

For **node-level datasets**, the authors mention:
1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset.
3. **PubMed**: A citation network dataset.
4. **Co-authorship (CS)**: A dataset based on co-authorship relationships.
5. **Co-authorship (Physics)**: Another co-authorship dataset.
6. **Co-purchase (Photo)**: A dataset based on co-purchase relationships from Amazon.
7. **Co-purchase (Computers)**: Another co-purchase dataset.

For **graph-level datasets**, the authors list:
1. **AIDS**: A dataset representing molecular graphs for binary classification.
2. **NCI1**: A dataset for multi-class classification of molecular graphs.
3. **PROTEINS-full**: A bioinformatics dataset for protein classification.
4. **ENZYMES**: Another bioinformatics dataset for enzyme classification.
5. **DD**: A dataset focusing on pharmacological substances.
6. **COLORS-3**: A synthetic dataset for color counting tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I will extract are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
