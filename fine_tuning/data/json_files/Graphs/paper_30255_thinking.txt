To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TripleRE: Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Tripled Relation Vectors" by Long Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale knowledge graph dataset **ogbl-wikikg2** and competitive performance on other datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **ogbl-wikikg2**: This dataset is described as a large-scale knowledge graph extracted from the Wikidata knowledge base, containing 2,500,604 entities and 535 relation types.

2. **ogbl-biokg**: This dataset is focused on biomedicine and contains 93,773 entities classified into five categories (diseases, proteins, drugs, side effects, and protein functions) and 51 relation types.

3. **FB15k**: A smaller knowledge graph with 14,951 entities and 1,345 relation types.

4. **FB15k237**: A subset of FB15k, which retains the same number of entities but has 237 relation types, as all inverse relations are removed.

5. **WN18**: Another small-scale knowledge graph with 40,943 entities and 18 relation types.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
