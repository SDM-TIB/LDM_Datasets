To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-ID with Local-enhance and Prototype Dictionary Learning" by Haopeng Hou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on "two large datasets," which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to these datasets. The introduction mentions the challenges of person re-identification and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, but does not specify their names.

I will then look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV.A (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they identify:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset includes 32,668 person images of 1,501 identities captured by 6 cameras. The training set consists of 12,936 images from 751 identities, while the test set has 19,732 images from 750 identities.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset contains 16,522 person images of 702 identities and is a subset of the DukeMTMC dataset. It provides manually marked bounding boxes and was collected using 8 cameras.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1116–1124.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 17–35.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
