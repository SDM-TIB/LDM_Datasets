To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning in Continuous-Time Dynamic Signed Networks" by Mohit Raghavendra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on **four real-world datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 3**, which lists the datasets along with their characteristics such as the number of nodes, links, fraction of positive links, and whether they contain weights.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **BTC-Otc**: A who-trusts-whom network of people trading Bitcoin on OTC platforms. It has 21.5K nodes, 170.5K links, a fraction of positive links (f+) of 0.89, and it includes weights.

2. **BTC-Alpha**: Another who-trusts-whom network of people trading Bitcoin on Alpha platforms. It has 5.9K nodes, 131.9K links, a fraction of positive links (f+) of 0.85, and it includes weights.

3. **WikiRfA**: A voting network for Wikipedia members' requests for adminship. It has 3.8K nodes, 871.4K links, a fraction of positive links (f+) of 0.77, and it includes weights.

4. **Epinions**: A trust network between members of an online consumer review site. It has 14.1K nodes, 945 links, a fraction of positive links (f+) of 0.85, and it includes weights.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **BTC-Otc** and **BTC-Alpha**, the citations are:
  > Omid Askarisichani, Jacqueline Ng Lane, Francesco Bullo, Noah E Friedkin, Ambuj K Singh, and Brian Uzzi. *Structural balance emerges and explains performance in risky decision-making*. Nature communications, 10(1):1–10, 2019.

- For **WikiRfA**, the citation is:
  > Robert West, Hristo S Paskov, Jure Leskovec, and Christopher Potts. *Exploiting social network structure for person-to-person sentiment analysis*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:297–310, 2014.

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Srijan Kumar, Bryan Hooi, Disha Makhija, Mohit Kumar, Christos Faloutsos, and VS Subrahmanian. *Rev2: Fraudulent user prediction in rating platforms*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pages 333–341, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further use or analysis.
