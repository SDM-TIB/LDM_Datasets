To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification: A Good Instance Classifier is All You Need" by Linhao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **CIFAR-MIL Dataset**: This is a simulated dataset constructed using CIFAR-10, which consists of 60,000 32×32 pixel color images divided into 10 categories. The authors describe how they created this dataset for their experiments.

2. **Camelyon16 Dataset**: This dataset is publicly available and used for detecting breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes. The authors provide details about the number of slides and instances, as well as the labeling criteria.

3. **TCGA Lung Cancer Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,054 whole slide images obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas, with specific details about the lung cancer subtypes included.

4. **Cervical Cancer Dataset**: This is an in-house dataset that includes 374 whole slide images of primary lesions of cervical cancer, with detailed descriptions of how the dataset was constructed and labeled.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For the **Camelyon16 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Campanella et al. *Clinical-grade computational pathology using weakly supervised deep learning on whole slide images*. Nature Medicine, vol. 25, no. 8, pp. 1301–1309, 2019.

- For the **TCGA Lung Cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma*. Nature, vol. 511, no. 7511, pp. 543–550, 2014.

- For the **Cervical Cancer Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for their specific research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
