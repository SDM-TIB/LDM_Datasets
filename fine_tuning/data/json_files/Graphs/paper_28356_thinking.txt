To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Dynamic Contrast and Probability Distillation for Unsupervised Person Re-Id" by De Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves superior performance on multiple person re-identification datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their method on four large-scale person re-identification benchmark datasets:

1. **Market1501**: This dataset contains 751 identities with 12,936 training images and is widely used for person re-identification tasks.

2. **DukeMTMC**: This dataset includes 702 identities and 16,522 training images, making it another popular choice for evaluating person re-identification methods.

3. **MSMT17-v2**: This dataset features 1,041 identities and 32,621 training images, providing a diverse set of images for testing.

4. **PersonX**: This is a synthetic dataset designed with various obstacles and conditions, containing 410 identities and 9,840 training images.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
