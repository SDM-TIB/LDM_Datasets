To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Classification of Sewer Pipe Defects and Properties using a Cross-Task Graph Neural Network Decoder" by Joakim Bruslund Haurum et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on the **Sewer-ML dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Sewer-ML dataset** in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that the dataset contains **1.3 million images** collected over a nine-year period, with a split of **1 million for training, 130k for validation, and 130k for testing**. They also describe the tasks associated with the dataset, including defect classification, water level estimation, pipe material classification, and pipe shape classification.

In the **related works section**, the authors refer to the **Sewer-ML dataset** again, emphasizing its importance in the context of automated sewer inspections. This reinforces that the dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Sewer-ML dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> Joakim Bruslund Haurum and Thomas B. Moeslund. *Sewer-ML: A multi-label sewer defect classification dataset and benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2021.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the specified requirements.

The dataset extracted is:
1. **Sewer-ML Dataset**: Contains 1.3 million images for multi-label sewer defect classification, with annotations for defects, water levels, pipe materials, and shapes.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
