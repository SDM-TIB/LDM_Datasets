To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning" by Jingyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention the datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors detail the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In this paper, I will find that the authors mention six datasets: **Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, DBLP, Amazon-Photo, and Amazon-Computer**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as well as any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, I will find the following citations for the datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**:
   > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In *International conference on machine learning* (pp. 40-48). PMLR.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:
   > Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2017). Deep gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03815*.

4. **DBLP Dataset**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

5. **Amazon-Photo Dataset**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

6. **Amazon-Computer Dataset**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
