To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Biomedical Entity Linking with Triple-aware Pre-Training" by Xi Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and evaluation sections for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of biomedical entity linking and mention the need for refined methods. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for fine-tuning their model. They state that they fine-tuned their model on two established datasets: **BC5CDR** and **NCBI**. 

1. **BC5CDR**: This dataset is derived from PubMed papers and is annotated for chemical-disease relations. The authors mention that it contains a total of 268,162 entities across its training, development, and test sets.

2. **NCBI**: Similar to BC5CDR, this dataset is also annotated from PubMed papers and focuses on disease name recognition and concept normalization. It contains 14,967 entities.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BC5CDR**, the citation is:
  > Li, J., Sun, Y., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., Wei, C.-H., Leaman, R., Mattingly, C. J., Wiegers, T. C., & Lu, Z. (2016). Biocreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction. *Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation*, 2016.

- For **NCBI**, the citation is:
  > Dogan, R. I., Leaman, R., & Lu, Z. (2014). NCBI disease corpus: A resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 47, 1-10.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
