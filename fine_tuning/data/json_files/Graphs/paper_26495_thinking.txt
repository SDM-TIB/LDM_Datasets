To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The impossibility of low rank representations for triangle-rich complex networks" by C. Seshadhri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a reference to a **Table 1** that summarizes the datasets used, which is a strong indication that the datasets are clearly listed there.

Upon locating **Table 1**, I will extract the relevant information about each dataset, including the dataset name, type, number of nodes, and number of edges. The datasets mentioned in the table are:

1. **Facebook**: A social network dataset with 88K nodes and 4K edges.
2. **cit-HepPh**: A citation network dataset with 421K nodes and 34K edges.
3. **String hs**: A protein-protein interaction network with 5.6M nodes and 19K edges.
4. **ca-HepPh**: A co-authorship network with 118M nodes and 12K edges.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are obtained from the SNAP graph database and other sources. I will ensure to include the proper citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper.

The citations I will include are:

- For **Facebook** dataset:
  > SNAP. Stanford Network Analysis Project, Available at http://snap.stanford.edu/, 2019.

- For **cit-HepPh** dataset:
  > Citation network dataset. Available at https://aminer.org/citation, 2019.

- For **String hs** dataset:
  > String database. Available at http://version10.string-db.org/, 2019.

- For **ca-HepPh** dataset:
  > SNAP. Stanford Network Analysis Project, Available at http://snap.stanford.edu/, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, type, number of nodes, number of edges, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
