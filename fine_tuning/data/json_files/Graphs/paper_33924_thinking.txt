To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Continual Learning with Importance Sampling and Prototype-Instance Relation Distillation" by Jiyong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their experiments on "standard continual learning benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used. In the **experimental setup**, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Seq-Cifar-10**: This dataset is derived from the original CIFAR-10 dataset and is split into 5 tasks with 2 classes per task. The authors note that it is commonly used as a benchmark in continual learning research.

2. **Seq-Cifar-100**: Similar to Seq-Cifar-10, this dataset is constructed from CIFAR-100 and divided into 5 tasks with 20 classes per task. This dataset is also referenced as a standard benchmark in the field.

3. **Seq-Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset is created from the Tiny ImageNet dataset, which is split into 10 tasks of 20 classes each. It is mentioned as another commonly used benchmark for continual learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since these datasets are derived from well-known datasets, I will provide the original citations for the datasets they are based on:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115: 211â€“252, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
