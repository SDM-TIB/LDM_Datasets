To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Contrastive and Cost-Sensitive Learning for Cervical Cancer Classification" by Ashfiqun Mustari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed system was evaluated on the **SIPaKMeD dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of cervical cancer detection and emphasizes the use of the SIPaKMeD dataset for classification tasks.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the input data. Here, they provide detailed information about the **SIPaKMeD dataset**, including its composition of 4049 cropped images of isolated cells and 966 images of Pap smear slide cluster cells, along with the class labels and the dataset's division into training, validation, and test sets. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the **Herlev dataset** in the context of previous studies, but they do not use it in their own experiments. Therefore, I will focus on the SIPaKMeD dataset for extraction.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the SIPaKMeD dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **SIPaKMeD dataset**:
  > M. E. Plissiti, P. Dimitrakopoulos, G. Sfikas, C. Nikou, O. Krikoni, and A. Charchanti. *SIPaKMeD: A new dataset for feature and image based classification of normal and pathological cervical cells in pap smear images*. In Proceedings of the 2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pages 3144â€“3148, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets used for their experiments, I will finalize my extraction with the SIPaKMeD dataset.

In summary, I will create an entry for the SIPaKMeD dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as part of the dataset description. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
