To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Data Augmentation for Contrastive Sentence Representation Learning" by Tianduo Wang and Wei Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a large amount of unlabeled sentences and labeled sentence pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using two training datasets:

1. **Wiki1M**: This is an unlabeled dataset containing 1 million sentences sampled from Wikipedia. It is used for contrastive learning in an unsupervised setting.

2. **NLI Dataset**: This dataset combines the SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) and MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference) datasets. It comprises 275,600 sentence triplets formatted as (anchor, entailment, contradiction) and is used for supervised training.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wiki1M**, the citation is:
  > Gao, T., Fisch, A., & Chen, D. (2021). SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **SNLI** and **MNLI**, the citations are:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In Proceedings of EMNLP.
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of NAACL.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
