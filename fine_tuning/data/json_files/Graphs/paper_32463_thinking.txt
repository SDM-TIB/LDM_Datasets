To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEV-DG: Cross-Modal Learning under Bird’s-Eye View for Domain Generalization of 3D Semantic Segmentation" by Miaoyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of domain generalization in 3D semantic segmentation and mention the use of multiple datasets. This indicates that datasets are crucial to their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **A2D2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of point clouds acquired by a Velodyne 16-beam LiDAR, with approximately 28,000 training frames and 2,000 validation frames.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset contains around 40,000 LiDAR frames annotated with 3D bounding boxes, using a 32-beam LiDAR sensor. The training set includes approximately 28,000 frames from 700 scenes, while the evaluation set has around 6,000 frames from 150 scenes.

3. **SemanticKITTI Dataset**: This dataset uses a Velodyne 64-beam LiDAR and includes sequences 00-07 and 09-10 for training, with around 19,000 training frames and 4,000 evaluation frames.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
