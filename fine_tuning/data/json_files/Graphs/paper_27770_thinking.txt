To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoSQA: 20,000+ Web Queries for Code Search and Question Answering" by Junjie Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the CoSQA dataset, which contains 20,604 pairs of web queries and code, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **Datasets section** (Section 2.1) where the authors discuss existing datasets related to code search and question answering. Here, I will look for any datasets that are referenced, including their names and descriptions. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **CodeSearchNet**: This dataset is referenced multiple times and is known for its large-scale collection of code and natural language pairs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Husain, M., Wu, H.-H., Gazit, T., Allamanis, M., & Brockschmidt, M. (2019). CodeSearchNet challenge: Evaluating the state of semantic code search. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.09436.

2. **Lv et al. (2015)**: This dataset is mentioned as containing web queries but is noted to be small in scale. The citation is:
   > Lv, F., Zhang, H., Lou, J.-G., Wang, S., Zhang, D., & Zhao, J. (2015). Codehow: Effective code search based on API understanding and extended boolean model. In Proceedings of the 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE), pages 260â€“270.

3. **CodeXGLUE**: This is another dataset mentioned in the context of code search and question answering. The citation is:
   > Lu, M., Sun, X., Wang, S., Lo, D., & Duan, Y. (2021). Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code understanding and generation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.04664.

After identifying these datasets, I will also check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that highlights each dataset's relevance to the research presented in the paper.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
