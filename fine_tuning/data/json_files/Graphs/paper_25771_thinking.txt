To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks" by Keyulu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the introduction, the authors discuss experiments on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Citeseer**: This dataset is used for classifying academic papers into different subjects. It contains 3,327 nodes (papers), 4,732 edges (citations), and 6 classes. The features consist of 3,703 bag-of-words features.

2. **Cora**: Similar to Citeseer, this dataset is also for classifying academic papers. It has 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes, with 1,433 bag-of-words features.

3. **Reddit**: This dataset is used for predicting community affiliations of Reddit posts. It contains 232,965 nodes and a large number of edges (average degree of 492), with 50 classes and 300 features.

4. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)**: This dataset consists of 24 graphs corresponding to different human tissues, with 56,944 nodes and 818,716 edges. It has 121 classes and 50 features.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For **Reddit**:
  > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)*, 1025-1035.

- For **PPI**:
  > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)*, 1025-1035.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
