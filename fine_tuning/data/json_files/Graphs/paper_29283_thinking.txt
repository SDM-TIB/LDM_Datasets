To extract datasets from the research paper titled "4-bit Conformer with Native Quantization Aware Training for Speech Recognition" by Shaojin Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **LibriSpeech dataset** and an **internal large-scale dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental setups)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset contains 960 hours of speech, with 460 hours classified as "clean" speech and 500 hours as "noisy" speech. This dataset is widely used in the ASR community, and its structure is clearly defined in the paper.

2. **Internal Large-Scale Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of approximately 400,000 hours of English audio-text pairs sourced from various domains, including YouTube and anonymized voice search traffic. They note that the YouTube data was transcribed in a semi-supervised manner, while other domains were hand-transcribed.

Additionally, the authors mention using a **Voice Search (VS) test set** for evaluations, which contains around 12,000 voice search utterances.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Panayotov, G. Chen, W. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

- The **internal large-scale dataset** does not have a specific citation since it is proprietary to Google and not publicly available. However, I will note that it is a significant dataset used in the experiments.

- For the **Voice Search test set**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is mentioned as part of the internal datasets used for evaluation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
