To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "STransE: a novel embedding model of entities and relationships in knowledge bases" by Dat Quoc Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their model achieves better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4 (Experiments)**, they mention two datasets: **WN18** and **FB15k**. I will note down the relevant statistics provided for these datasets, such as the number of entities, relation types, and the number of training, validation, and test triples.

In **Table 2**, the authors summarize the statistics of the datasets:
- **WN18**: 
  - Number of entities: 40,943
  - Number of relation types: 18
  - Number of training triples: 141,442
  - Number of validation triples: 5,000
  - Number of test triples: 5,000

- **FB15k**: 
  - Number of entities: 14,951
  - Number of relation types: 1,345
  - Number of training triples: 483,142
  - Number of validation triples: 59,071
  - Number of test triples: 50,000

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original papers that introduced these datasets:

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, pages 2787–2795, 2013.

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, pages 2787–2795, 2013.

Both datasets are referenced in the same paper, which is important for accurate citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
