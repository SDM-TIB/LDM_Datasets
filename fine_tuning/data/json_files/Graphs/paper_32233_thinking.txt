To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI and Non-AI Assessments for Dementia" by Mahboobeh Parsapoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on AI and non-AI assessments for dementia, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss assessments**, particularly the sections on **non-AI assessments** and **AI assessments**. These sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of various datasets used in the studies referenced by the authors. I will look for tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information about each dataset's characteristics.

In the **non-AI assessments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables that list specific assessments and their corresponding datasets. For example, if a table lists various cognitive assessments along with the datasets used to validate them, I will extract the names of those datasets.

Similarly, in the **AI assessments section**, I will look for mentions of datasets used for training or validating AI models. The authors may reference specific datasets used in their experiments, and I will note these down.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the paper references the "Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)" dataset, I will locate the corresponding citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Jack, C. R., et al. (2008). "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods." *Alzheimer's & Dementia*, 4(1): 1-12.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, types, characteristics, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their proper citations.
