To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FGBERT: Function-Driven Pre-trained Gene Language Model for Metagenomics" by Chenrui Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the superiority of their proposed model on eight datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Pre-training Datasets)**, they mention the **MGnify dataset**, which contains 2,973,257,435 protein sequences from various microbial communities. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's training context.

Then, I will look at **section 4.2 (Genomic Structure Analysis)**, where the authors refer to the **E-K12 dataset** from RegulonDB, which consists of 4,315 operons. This dataset is essential for operon prediction tasks.

In **section 4.3 (Functional Gene Prediction)**, the authors discuss the **CARD dataset**, which is a comprehensive database of antimicrobial resistance genes. This dataset is divided into three categories: AMR Gene Family (CARD-A), Drug Class (CARD-D), and Resistance Mechanism (CARD-R), with specific counts for each category.

Next, I will check **section 4.4 (Pathogenicity Potential Assessment)**, where the **PATRIC dataset** is mentioned, containing 5,000 pathogenic bacterial sequences and 110 pathogenic classes. This dataset is significant for assessing pathogenicity.

In **section 4.5 (Nitrogen Cycle Prediction)**, the authors refer to the **NCycDB dataset**, which includes 213,501 sequences related to nitrogen cycling genes across eight processes. This dataset is vital for environmental genomics research.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MGnify dataset**:

2. **E-K12 dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
