To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Graph Structured Models for Video Understanding" by Anurag Arnab, Chen Sun, and Cordelia Schmid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on **two different tasks** requiring relational reasoning in videos, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on **AVA** and **UCF101-24** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, they explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **AVA** dataset, which is described as the largest dataset for spatio-temporal action detection, and the **UCF101-24** dataset, which is a standard benchmark for action recognition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **AVA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chunhui Gu, Chen Sun, David A Ross, Carl Vondrick, Caroline Pantofaru, Yeqing Li, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, George Toderici, Susanna Ricco, Rahul Sukthankar, et al. *AVA: A Video Dataset of Spatio-Temporally Localized Atomic Visual Actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6047-6056, 2018.

2. **UCF101-24 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes from Videos in the Wild*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
