To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Manifold Contrastive Learning with Variational Lie Group Operators" by Kion Fallah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed methods on self-supervised benchmarks for image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Image Datasets)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using several datasets for evaluation, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **STL10**: A dataset containing 10 classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images, where each image is 96x96 pixels.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class, and images are resized to 64x64 pixels.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also mention the use of these datasets for various tasks, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf.

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, volume 15, pages 215–223, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, 2011. URL: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/coates11a.html.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, June 2009. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
