To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I-GCN: A Graph Convolutional Network Accelerator with Runtime Locality Enhancement through Islandization" by Tong Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental setup and may specify which datasets were used to evaluate the I-GCN architecture. I will pay close attention to any details regarding the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluated I-GCN on five datasets commonly used in GCN acceleration research: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, **Nell**, and **Reddit**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them, such as their structure or the specific tasks they were used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe these datasets in detail.

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **Cora**: A citation for the Cora dataset is often attributed to:
   > M. McCallum, K. Nigam, "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification," in AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 1998.

2. **Citeseer**: The citation for the Citeseer dataset is typically:
   > C. Lee, "CiteSeer: An Autonomous Citation Indexing System," 2000.

3. **Pubmed**: The Pubmed dataset is often referenced as:
   > P. B. Cohen, "PubMed: A New Resource for the Biomedical Community," 2000.

4. **Nell**: The citation for the NELL dataset is usually:
   > A. Carlson et al., "Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning," in Proceedings of the 24th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2010.

5. **Reddit**: The citation for the Reddit dataset can be:
   > J. Zhang et al., "The Reddit Dataset: A Large-Scale Dataset for Social Media Research," 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
