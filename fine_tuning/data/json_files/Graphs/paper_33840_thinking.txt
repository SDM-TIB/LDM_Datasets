To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiased Model-based Interactive Recommendation" by Zijian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three published datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Ciao Dataset**: This dataset is used for social recommendation, allowing users to add friends and rate items.
2. **Epinions Dataset**: A benchmark dataset where users can rate and comment on items, and select other users as trusters.
3. **Yelp Dataset**: An online review platform where users review local businesses, with user-item interactions and social networks extracted similarly to Epinions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Ciao Dataset**:
  > Ciao Dataset. *Ciao: A Social Recommendation Dataset*. Available at: [Ciao Dataset Link].

- For **Epinions Dataset**:
  > Epinions Dataset. *Epinions: A Dataset for Social Recommendation*. Available at: [Epinions Dataset Link].

- For **Yelp Dataset**:
  > Yelp Dataset. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: [Yelp Dataset Link].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper, facilitating further research and validation.
