To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaxCorrMGNN: A Multi-Graph Neural Network Framework for Generalized Multimodal Fusion of Medical Data for Outcome Prediction" by Niharika S. Dâ€™Souza et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a **Tuberculosis (TB) dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset. In section 3.1, the authors describe the **Tuberculosis Data Exploration Portal**, which consists of 3051 patients and five different treatment outcomes. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the modalities involved (demographic, clinical, genomic, and imaging data).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Tuberculosis dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Tuberculosis Data Exploration Portal**: 
  > Gabrielian, A., Engle, E., Harris, M., Wollenberg, K., Juarez-Espinosa, O., Glogowski, A., Long, A., Patti, L., Hurt, D.E., Rosenthal, A., Tartakovsky, M. (2019). *Tb depot (data exploration portal): A multi-domain tuberculosis data analysis resource*. PLOS ONE, 14(5), e0217410. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217410

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Tuberculosis Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 3051 patients with five different treatment outcomes (Died, Still on treatment, Completed, Cured, or Failure). It contains features from various modalities, including demographic, clinical, regimen, genomic, and imaging data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
