To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QEAN: Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network for Visual Dance Generation" by Zhizhen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **AIST++ dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the AIST++ dataset. The authors describe it as constructed from the AIST dance video database, containing 3D human keypoint annotations and camera parameters for 10.1 million images across 30 subjects and 9 viewpoints. It also includes 1,408 dance movement sequences across various genres, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AIST++ dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **AIST++ Dataset**:
  > Shuhei Tsuchida, Satoru Fukayama, Masahiro Hamasaki, and Masataka Goto. *AIST Dance Video Database: Multi-Genre, Multi-Dancer, and Multi-Camera Database for Dance Information Processing*. In Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, 2019. URL: https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208334750.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the AIST++ dataset, I will ensure that I accurately document this dataset's details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
