To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReContrast: Domain-Specific Anomaly Detection via Contrastive Reconstruction" by Jia Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across two industrial defect detection benchmarks and three medical image UAD tasks, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they list:

1. **MVTec AD**: This dataset is described as containing 15 sub-datasets (5 textures and 10 objects) with a total of 3,629 normal images for training and 1,725 images for testing, including both normal and anomalous images. Pixel-level annotations are available for evaluating anomaly segmentation.

2. **VisA**: This dataset consists of 12 sub-datasets with a total of 9,621 normal and 1,200 anomalous images. It also provides pixel-level annotations for evaluating anomaly segmentation.

3. **OCT2017**: An optical coherence tomography dataset with 26,315 normal images for training and 1,000 images for testing, labeled into four classes: normal, drusen, DME, and CNV.

4. **APTOS**: A color fundus image dataset from the 2019 APTOS blindness detection challenge, containing 3,662 images with annotations indicating different severity levels of diabetic retinopathy.

5. **ISIC2018**: A skin disease dataset with seven classes, where NV (nevus) is the normal class and the rest are considered anomalies.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MVTec AD**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
