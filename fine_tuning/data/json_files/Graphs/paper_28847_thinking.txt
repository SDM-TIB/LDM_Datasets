To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Adaptive Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting" by Ling Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on six real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they list the datasets and provide statistics about each one, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Solar-Energy**: This dataset contains solar power data collected from 137 photovoltaic plants in Alabama, sampled every 10 minutes.
2. **Traffic**: This dataset includes road occupancy rates from 862 sensors in the San Francisco Bay Area, aggregated hourly.
3. **Electricity**: This dataset consists of electricity consumption data from 321 clients, aggregated hourly.
4. **Exchange-Rate**: This dataset contains daily exchange rates for eight countries from 1990 to 2016.
5. **Nasdaq**: This dataset includes stock prices for 82 corporations, sampled per minute from July to December 2016.
6. **METR-LA**: This dataset contains average traffic speeds from 207 loop detectors in Los Angeles County, aggregated every 5 minutes.

I will then verify the details of each dataset in the **table provided in section V**, which summarizes the statistics such as the number of samples, variables, and sample rates.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed for all datasets, but I will look for any references that provide the original sources of the datasets.

For example, the **Solar-Energy dataset** might be cited as:
> National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Solar Power Data*. [Online]. Available: [URL]

The **Traffic dataset** might be cited as:
> California Department of Transportation. *Traffic Sensor Data*. [Online]. Available: [URL]

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring that I capture the necessary details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
