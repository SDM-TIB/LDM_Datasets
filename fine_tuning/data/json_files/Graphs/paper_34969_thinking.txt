To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UTG: Towards a Unified View of Snapshot and Event Based Models for Temporal Graphs" by Shenyang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In the paper, I find that the authors mention five discrete-time dynamic graph datasets and three continuous-time dynamic graph datasets. Specifically, they list the following datasets:

1. **UCI Dataset**: Contains 1,899 nodes and 26,628 edges.
2. **Enron Dataset**: Contains 184 nodes and 10,472 edges.
3. **Contact Dataset**: Contains 694 nodes and 463,558 edges.
4. **Social Evolution Dataset**: Contains 74 nodes and 87,479 edges.
5. **MOOC Dataset**: Contains 7,144 nodes and 236,808 edges.
6. **tgbl-wiki Dataset**: Contains 9,227 nodes and 157,474 edges.
7. **tgbl-review Dataset**: Contains 352,637 nodes and 4,873,540 edges.
8. **Reddit Dataset**: Contains 10,984 nodes and 672,447 edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to datasets from previous works, particularly the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) for the tgbl-wiki and tgbl-review datasets, and cite the relevant papers.

The citations I need to include are:

- For the **UCI, Enron, Contact, Social Evolution, and MOOC datasets**, the citation is:
  > Poursafaei, F., Huang, S., Danovitch, J., Fey, M., Hu, W., Rossi, E., Leskovec, J., Bronstein, M., Rabusseau, G., & Rabbany, R. (2023). Temporal Graph Benchmark for Machine Learning on Temporal Graphs. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

- For the **tgbl-wiki and tgbl-review datasets**, the citation is:
  > Huang, S., Poursafaei, F., Danovitch, J., Fey, M., Hu, W., Rossi, E., Leskovec, J., Bronstein, M., Rabusseau, G., & Rabbany, R. (2023). Temporal Graph Benchmark for Machine Learning on Temporal Graphs. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

- For the **Reddit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nadiri, A., & Takes, F. W. (2022). A large-scale temporal analysis of user lifespan durability on the reddit social media platform. In *Companion Proceedings of the Web Conference 2022* (pp. 677-685).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
