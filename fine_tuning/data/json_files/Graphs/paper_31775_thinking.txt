To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings from AI Feedback" by Qinyuan Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of AI feedback to improve contrastive learning, but it does not specify any datasets yet. The introduction mentions the importance of sentence embeddings and references several studies, but I need to look deeper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup. In section 4.1, titled **Evaluation Datasets**, the authors list several datasets used in their experiments:

1. **STS Benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating semantic textual similarity tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Daniel M. Cer, Mona T. Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity - multilingual and cross-lingual focused evaluation*. CoRR, abs/1708.00055, 2017.

2. **SICK-Relatedness**: This dataset is also used for semantic textual similarity tasks. The citation is:
   > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2014, Reykjavik, Iceland, May 26-31, 2014, pages 216–223. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

3. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for constructing positive sample pairs. The citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2015, Lisbon, Portugal, September 17-21, 2015, pages 632–642. The Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is also used for constructing sample pairs. The citation is:
   > Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych. *Sentence-BERT: Sentence embeddings using Siamese BERT-networks*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019, pages 3980–3990. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Wiki-1M** dataset, which is used in their experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych. *Sentence-BERT: Sentence embeddings using Siamese BERT-networks*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019, pages 3980–3990. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- STS Benchmark
- SICK-Relatedness
- SNLI
- MNLI
- Wiki-1M

I will ensure that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
