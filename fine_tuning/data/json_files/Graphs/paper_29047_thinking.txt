To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning-based UAV detection in the low altitude clutter background" by Zeyang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on both real and simulated data, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Set Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two groups of data:

1. **Real Measured Data**: This dataset is described as a monostatic radar detection signal from a low-altitude UAV obtained in an outdoor scenario. It includes segments with varying signal-to-noise ratios and annotations for single and dual UAV targets.

2. **MATLAB Simulation Dataset**: This dataset is based on the multipath effect and ground clutter interference of low-altitude UAV signal propagation. The authors provide specific parameters such as the radar system's height, radial velocity of the UAV, and the characteristics of the carrier signal.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the real measured data as being jointly published by two scientific institutions, which I will need to locate for proper citation. The MATLAB simulation dataset is based on the authors' own simulations, so it may not have a separate citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Real Measured Data**, I will cite it as:
  > Zhi-Yong Song, Bing-wei Hui, Hong-qi Fan, et al. "A dataset for detection and tracking of dim aircraft targets through radar echo sequences." Science Data Bank, 2019. http://www.sciencedb.cn/dataSet/handle/908. (Accessed: 2020-05-14).

- For the **MATLAB Simulation Dataset**, since it is based on the authors' own work, I will note that it does not have a separate citation but is described in detail in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
