To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural News Recommendation with Collaborative News Encoding and Structural User Encoding" by Zhiming Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **MIND dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of effective representation learning for news recommendation, but they primarily reference the MIND dataset as the basis for their experiments.

In the **experiment setup section**, the authors provide detailed information about the MIND dataset. They describe it as a large-scale English news recommendation dataset built from real-world MSN news and anonymized user click logs. They also mention that they randomly sampled 200K users' click logs from a larger dataset, which further emphasizes the significance of the MIND dataset in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIND dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MIND dataset**: 
  > Chuhan Wu, Fangzhao Wu, Mingxiao An, Jianqiang Huang, Yongfeng Huang, and Xing Xie. *MIND: A large-scale dataset for news recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3597â€“3606, Online, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIND Dataset**: A large-scale English news recommendation dataset built from real-world MSN news and anonymized user click logs. The dataset includes 200K users' click logs sampled from a larger dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the MIND dataset.
