To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Social Event Detection via Hyperbolic Graph Representations" by Zitai Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of social media datasets for detecting social events, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. I will look for any specific dataset names or references.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Twitter dataset** as their primary dataset and also refer to a **mini-Twitter dataset** created from the larger dataset for practical reasons. They also mention using the **Cora** and **Citeseer** datasets for evaluating the efficacy of their models.

I will then check the **dataset descriptions** provided in the paper. The authors provide statistical information about the datasets, including the number of classes, nodes, and features for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The Twitter dataset is a well-known public dataset, and I will ensure to cite it correctly. The Cora and Citeseer datasets are also widely used in the research community, and I will find their authoritative citations.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for social event detection.
   - Citation: McMinn, A. J., Moshfeghi, Y., & Jose, J. M. (2013). Building a large-scale corpus for evaluating event detection on Twitter. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (pp. 409-418).

2. **mini-Twitter Dataset**: A balanced subset created from the Twitter dataset for practical experimentation.
   - Citation: This dataset is derived from the Twitter dataset, so the same citation applies.

3. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset used for evaluating the models.
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

4. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset used for model evaluation.
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
