To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physical Context and Timing Aware Sequence Generating GANs" by Hayato Futase et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to a dataset of sequential changes in die forging processes, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context for their work. Here, they mention the importance of evaluating their model on real data, which further emphasizes the need to identify the dataset used.

I will then look closely at the **experiments** section, particularly where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. In this section, they describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of 14 target product models with 12 modifications for each model, and that the dataset includes images of shapes generated through simulations of die forging processes. They also mention the division of the dataset into training, development, and test sets.

The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including:
- The dataset consists of 14 models with 14,102 shapes for training, 1,150 shapes for development, and 938 shapes for testing.
- The images are mapped from physical information such as radial stress and strain.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the original dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a "CAE dataset of die forging processes," but they do not provide a specific citation in the text. Therefore, I will need to look for any relevant references that might provide more information about this dataset.

After reviewing the references, I find that the dataset is likely derived from the work of Oh et al. (1991), which discusses the DEFORM software used for simulations in die forging processes. The citation for this reference is:
> Oh, S. I., Wu, W. T., Tang, J. P., & Vedhanayagam, A. (1991). Capabilities and applications of FEM code DEFORM: the perspective of the developer. *Journal of Materials Processing Technology*.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I took to extract the datasets from the paper were:
1. Read the abstract for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyze the introduction for context and dataset relevance.
3. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
4. Consult the references section for full citations related to the datasets.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
