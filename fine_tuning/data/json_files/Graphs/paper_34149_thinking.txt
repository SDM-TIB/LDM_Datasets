To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TinyVQA: Compact Multimodal Deep Neural Network for Visual Question Answering on Resource-Constrained Hardware" by Hasib-Al Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the TinyVQA model was evaluated on the **FloodNet dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for understanding the paper's contributions.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of integrating multimodal deep neural networks for visual question answering (VQA) on resource-constrained devices. They mention the importance of datasets for training and evaluating these models, which reinforces the need to identify specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **evaluation section (3.1 Dataset Description)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **FloodNet-VQA dataset**. They explain that this dataset was collected in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and consists of 2,348 images and 10,480 question-answer pairs. The dataset is categorized into seven distinct question types, which are essential for assessing post-disaster scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FloodNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **FloodNet dataset**:

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **FloodNet-VQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for post-disaster damage assessment and includes 2,348 images and 10,480 question-answer pairs, categorized into seven distinct question types.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset and its citation from the research paper.
