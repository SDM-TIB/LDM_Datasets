To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Composition of Word Embeddings via Tensor Decomposition" by Abraham Frandsen and Rong Ge, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and may mention the datasets they used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **large corpus from the English Wikipedia** for training their model. However, they do not specify a named dataset in the traditional sense, as they are using a pre-existing corpus rather than a curated dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or corpora that the authors might have used. In this case, the authors reference several foundational papers and methodologies but do not provide a specific dataset citation.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Corpus Used**: The authors trained their model using a February 2018 dump of the English Wikipedia. This is a commonly used corpus in natural language processing research.

2. **Citation for the Wikipedia Corpus**: While the authors do not provide a formal citation for the Wikipedia dump, I can reference it as follows:
   > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), February 2018.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the Wikipedia corpus as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In conclusion, I will document the dataset information as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: English Wikipedia (February 2018 dump)
- **Citation**: Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), February 2018.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for datasets and documented them accurately, including proper citations where applicable.
