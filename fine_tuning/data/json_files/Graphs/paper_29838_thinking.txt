To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ComDensE: Combined Dense Embedding of Relation-aware and Common Features for Knowledge Graph Completion" by Minsang Kim and Seungjun Baek, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that ComDensE achieves state-of-the-art performance on **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed method.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section IV (Experiment)**, they mention that ComDensE is evaluated on two benchmark datasets: **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR**. They also provide statistics about these datasets in **Table II**, which includes the number of entities, relations, and triples for each dataset.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset contains 14,541 entities, 237 relations, 272,115 training triples, 17,535 validation triples, and 20,466 test triples. The PageRank for this dataset is 0.733.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset consists of 40,943 entities, 11 relations, 86,835 training triples, 3,034 validation triples, and 3,134 test triples. The PageRank for this dataset is 0.104.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd workshop on continuous vector space models and their compositionality (pp. 57â€“66).

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Thirty-second AAAI conference on artificial intelligence.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.
