To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MG-GCN: Scalable Multi-GPU GCN Training Framework" by Muhammed Fatih BalÄ±n et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on larger datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are described in **section 6 (Experimental Evaluation)**. Here, the authors mention using two types of datasets: GNN Benchmark datasets and synthetic datasets generated with BTER.

1. **GNN Benchmark Datasets**: The authors list several datasets used in their experiments:
   - **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
   - **Arxiv**: Another citation network dataset.
   - **Products (OGBN-Products)**: A graph from the Amazon co-purchase network.
   - **Proteins (OGBN-Proteins)**: A biological network graph dataset.
   - **Reddit**: A graph from Reddit posts.

2. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated synthetic datasets using BTER, which are named based on their scaling factor (e.g., 1x, 2x, ..., 128x).

Now, I will gather the full citations for the benchmark datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- **Cora**: The citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017.

- **Arxiv**: The citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. 2021.

- **OGBN-Products**: The citation is:
  > William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. 2018.

- **OGBN-Proteins**: The citation is:
  > Weihua Hu et al. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. 2021.

- **Reddit**: The citation is:
  > William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. 2018.

For the synthetic datasets generated with BTER, since they are not standard datasets with established citations, I will note that they are based on the BTER model, which is referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
