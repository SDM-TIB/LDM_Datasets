To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reasoning Visual Dialogs with Structural and Partial Observations" by Zilong Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model on the **VisDial and VisDial-Q datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe their evaluation on the **VisDial v0.9 dataset**, which consists of dialog question-answer pairs collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk. They provide details about the dataset, including its size and the context in which it was collected. This section confirms that the VisDial v0.9 dataset is one of the primary datasets used in their experiments.

In section 4.2, the authors mention the **VisDial v1.0 dataset**, which is an updated version of the VisDial dataset. They describe how this dataset was collected similarly to VisDial v0.9 and provide information about its structure and the additional data it contains. This indicates that both versions of the VisDial dataset are relevant for their research.

Additionally, in section 4.3, the authors discuss the **VisDial-Q dataset**, which is built upon the VisDial v0.9 dataset. They explain how this dataset is used to evaluate the questioner side of visual dialog, further emphasizing its importance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **VisDial v0.9 Dataset**:
   > Abhishek Das, Satwik Kottur, Khushi Gupta, Avi Singh, Deshraj Yadav, José MF Moura, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Visual Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **VisDial v1.0 Dataset**:
   > Abhishek Das, Satwik Kottur, Khushi Gupta, Avi Singh, Deshraj Yadav, José MF Moura, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Visual Dialog v1.0*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

3. **VisDial-Q Dataset**:
   > Unnat Jain, Svetlana Lazebnik, and Alexander G Schwing. *Two can play this game: Visual dialog with discriminative question generation and answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **VisDial v0.9 Dataset**: A dataset for evaluating visual dialog systems, containing 1,232,870 dialog question-answer pairs on MSCOCO images.
- **VisDial v1.0 Dataset**: An updated version of the VisDial dataset, which includes additional dialog question-answer pairs.
- **VisDial-Q Dataset**: A dataset designed to assess the questioner side of visual dialog, built upon the VisDial v0.9 dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
