To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MESEN: Exploit Multimodal Data to Design Unimodal Human Activity Recognition with Few Labels" by Lilin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **eight public multimodal datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets along with their characteristics, which is crucial for understanding their context and relevance.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **UCI Dataset**: This dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope data from 30 users performing 6 activities with a smartphone. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jorge-L Reyes-Ortiz, Luca Oneto, Albert SamÃ , Xavier Parra, and Davide Anguita. *Transition-aware human activity recognition using smartphones*. Neurocomputing, 171, 754-767, 2016.

2. **MotionSense Dataset**: This dataset comprises data collected by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors from 24 users performing 6 activities. The citation is:
   > Mohammad Malekzadeh, Richard G Clegg, Andrea Cavallaro, and Hamed Haddadi. *Mobile sensor data anonymization*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation, 2019.

3. **HHAR Dataset**: This dataset includes accelerometer and gyroscope readings from 9 users performing 6 daily activities. The citation is:
   > Allan Stisen et al. *Smart devices are different: Assessing and mitigating mobile sensing heterogeneities for activity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, 2015.

4. **USC Dataset**: This dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope data from 14 users performing 12 activities. The citation is:
   > Mi Zhang and Alexander A Sawchuk. *USC-HAD: A daily activity dataset for ubiquitous activity recognition using wearable sensors*. In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Ubiquitous Computing, 2012.

5. **Shoaib Dataset**: This dataset contains magnetometer readings along with accelerometer and gyroscope data from 10 users performing 7 activities. The citation is:
   > Muhammad Shoaib et al. *Fusion of smartphone motion sensors for physical activity recognition*. Sensors, 14(6), 10146-10176, 2014.

6. **Cosmo-MHAD Dataset**: This dataset includes multimodal snippets from 30 users performing 14 activities. The citation is:
   > Xiaomin Ouyang et al. *Cosmo: Contrastive fusion learning with small data for multimodal human activity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, 2022.

7. **mRI Dataset**: This dataset is a multimodal 3D human pose dataset with over 5 million frames of mmWave and IMU data from 20 users. The citation is:
   > Sizhe An, Yin Li, and Umit Ogras. *mri: Multi-modal 3D human pose estimation dataset using mmwave, rgb-d, and inertial sensors*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 27414-27426, 2022.

8. **UTD Dataset**: This dataset contains data collected by a Microsoft Kinect sensor and a wearable inertial sensor. The citation is:
   > Chen Chen, Roozbeh Jafari, and Nasser Kehtarnavaz. *UTD-MHAD: A multimodal dataset for human action recognition utilizing a depth camera and a wearable inertial sensor*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 168-172, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information about the datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations ready for each dataset as they are critical for proper referencing and acknowledgment in any further work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review.
