To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal exit decision of venture capital under time-inconsistent preferences" by Yanzhao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets or methodology**. In many research papers, authors describe the datasets they used for their analysis in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

If the paper includes any **figures, tables, or references to external datasets**, I will examine these closely. Figures and tables often summarize data or results derived from datasets, and they may provide additional context or references to the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper discusses datasets from other studies, I will also look for the original sources of those datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
