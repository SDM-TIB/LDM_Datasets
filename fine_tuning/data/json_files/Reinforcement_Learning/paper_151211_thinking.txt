To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Timescale Ensemble Q-learning for Markov Decision Process Policy Optimization" by Talha Bozkus and Urbashi Mitra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel ensemble reinforcement learning algorithm and mentions "multiple, distinct, synthetically created and structurally related Markovian environments." This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe various network models and environments used for their simulations. They mention using **Erdős-Rényi random-directed graphs**, **cliff-walking environments**, and **SISO and MISO wireless network models**. These descriptions indicate that the authors have created synthetic datasets based on these models.

I will also check the **appendices and references** for any additional details or citations related to the datasets. The references may provide full citations for the original sources of the datasets or methodologies used to create them.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to the Erdős-Rényi graphs, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this model and provide its citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
