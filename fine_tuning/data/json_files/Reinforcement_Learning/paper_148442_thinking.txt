To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Charge RF-Energy Harvesting Devices in WiFi Networks" by Yizhou Luo and Kwan-Wu Chin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may reference prior works or datasets used in related studies, which could be useful.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they might mention specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

In this paper, there is no explicit mention of datasets in the abstract or introduction. However, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their simulations and the parameters used. They mention using various algorithms and parameters but do not specify any datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets directly, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to the study. This could include datasets used in previous research that the authors reference.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves. Instead, they reference studies that may have used datasets relevant to RF-energy harvesting or wireless communication.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. However, I will note the references that could potentially lead to datasets in future research:

1. **Reference [2]**: V. H. Tran et al., "WiWear: Wearable sensing via directional WiFi energy harvesting," in IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, Kyoto, Japan, Mar. 2019.
2. **Reference [6]**: V. Talla et al., "Powering the next billion devices with Wi-Fi," in ACM Conference on Emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies, Heidelberg, Germany, Dec. 2015.
3. **Reference [11]**: H. Lee and J. Lee, "Resource and task scheduling for SWIPT IoT systems with renewable energy sources," IEEE Internet of Things Journal, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 2729â€“2748, Apr. 2019.

These references may lead to datasets that could be relevant for similar studies in the field of RF-energy harvesting and wireless networks.

In summary, while this paper does not provide specific datasets, I have identified relevant references that could be explored for potential datasets in future research.
