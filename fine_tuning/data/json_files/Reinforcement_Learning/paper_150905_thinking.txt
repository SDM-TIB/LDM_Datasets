To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning RL-Policies for Joint Beamforming Without Exploration: A Batch Constrained Off-Policy Approach" by Heasung Kim and Sravan Kumar Ankireddy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that may detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Methodology," or "Data Collection."** In this paper, the authors discuss their approach to reinforcement learning and the need for data without direct interaction with the environment. They mention using a dataset for training their model, but I need to find the exact name and details of this dataset.

In the **"Numerical Results" section**, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used. They mention generating a dataset of **20,000 samples** for training their reinforcement learning agent. However, they do not specify a particular dataset name or source, which is crucial for citation.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references may include foundational works or datasets that the authors used to validate their approach. 

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for the data they generated. They refer to their own generated dataset for training, which is not a publicly available dataset. Therefore, I will note that while they used a dataset of their own creation, it lacks a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Generated Dataset**: A dataset of 20,000 samples created for training the reinforcement learning agent, but no formal citation is provided as it is not a publicly available dataset.

Since there are no external datasets mentioned with citations, I will conclude my extraction process here. If there were specific datasets with citations, I would ensure to include the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements.
