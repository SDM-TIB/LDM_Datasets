To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline RL for Natural Language Generation with Implicit Language Q Learning" by Charlie Snell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "curated datasets" for fine-tuning language models, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper. The introduction discusses the challenges of applying large language models to user-specified tasks, hinting at the need for datasets that facilitate this process.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which often includes the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Reddit Comments Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4 million comments scraped from Reddit, used to train agents for generating replies based on parent comments or posts. The paper indicates that the dataset is diverse and minimally curated, making it suitable for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

2. **Wordle Dataset**: The authors constructed a synthetic dataset for the Wordle game, which is designed to evaluate the capabilities of offline reinforcement learning algorithms. Additionally, they mention a natural Wordle dataset scraped from Twitter, consisting of 214,930 games, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of their method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Reddit Comments Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Snell, C., Kostrikov, I., Su, Y., Yang, M., & Levine, S. (2023). Offline RL for Natural Language Generation with Implicit Language Q Learning. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For the **Wordle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lokshtanov, D., & Subercaseaux, B. (2022). Wordle is NP-Hard. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.16713.

With these datasets identified and their citations noted, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
