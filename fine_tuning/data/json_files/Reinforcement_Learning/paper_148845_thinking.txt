To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Latent Flow" by Wenling Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on several benchmark tasks, specifically referring to the **DeepMind Control Suite** and **Atari games**. I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks within these categories.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the environments and evaluation metrics. Here, they mention the specific tasks from the **DeepMind Control Suite**: Quadruped Walk, Hopper Hop, Pendulum Swingup, Walker Run, and Finger Turn Hard. They also reference the **Atari 2600 Games**, including Assault, Breakout, Montezuma Revenge, and others.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
> Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

For the **Atari 2600 Games**, the citation is:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
