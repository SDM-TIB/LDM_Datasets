To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Coordinative Schedules for Tanker Terminals: An Intelligent Large Spatial-Temporal Data-Driven Approach - Part 1" by Deqing Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **3-month historical data of tanker vessels/terminals in Singapore port**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the dataset in more detail. They mention that the dataset spans from **March to May 2017** and includes data from automatic identification systems (AIS) and port terminal information. This confirms the dataset's temporal scope and its relevance to the study.

In the **data statistics section**, the authors provide additional context about the dataset, including its structure and the types of information it contains, such as vessel identity, location of stay, and timestamps. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, which is common in studies that utilize proprietary or internal datasets.

I will also look at the **results section** to see if the dataset is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss the effectiveness of their optimization approach based on the historical data, reinforcing the importance of this dataset in their analysis.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset appears to be derived from AIS data and specific to the authors' research context, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: 3-Month Historical Data of Tanker Vessels in Singapore Port
   - **Description**: This dataset includes spatial-temporal data collected from automatic identification systems (AIS) for tanker vessels operating in Singapore from March to May 2017. It contains information on vessel identities, locations, and timestamps of vessel movements.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is derived from AIS data and specific to the authors' research.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
