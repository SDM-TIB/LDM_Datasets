To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAC-Based Formal Verification for Out-of-Distribution Data Detection" by Mohit Prashant and Arvind Easwaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of data generated from CARLA, an open-source driving simulator, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the dataset used for training the variational autoencoder (VAE). They mention that the dataset consists of images generated from the CARLA driving simulator, which is characterized by specific environmental parameters such as precipitation and brightness levels.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the dataset's details and any additional datasets that may be referenced. The authors specify that they used 1600 in-distribution images for training and 200 for the calibration set, which provides further context about the dataset's composition.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The CARLA simulator is widely recognized in the research community, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation for it.

The citation for the CARLA dataset is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 1-16, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset consists of images generated from the CARLA driving simulator, which includes various environmental conditions. It contains 1600 in-distribution images used for training and 200 images for the calibration set.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited.
