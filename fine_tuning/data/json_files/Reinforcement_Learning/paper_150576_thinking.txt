To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation" by Marcos Treviso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the CREST framework and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental sections** (specifically sections 4 and 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the **IMDB** and **SNLI** datasets for their experiments. They also refer to revised versions of these datasets, specifically **rIMDB** and **rSNLI**, which were created by Kaushik et al. (2020).

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. The paper provides information about the datasets in section 4.1, where it states that the revised datasets contain counterfactuals created by humans on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, ensuring validity and coherence.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, 2011.

2. For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015.

3. For the **revised IMDB (rIMDB)** and **revised SNLI (rSNLI)** datasets, the citation is:
   > Divyansh Kaushik, Eduard Hovy, and Zachary Lipton. *Learning the difference that makes a difference with counterfactually-augmented data*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
