To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving OOV Detection and Resolution with External Language Models in Acoustic-to-Word ASR" by Hirofumi Inaguma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of external language models and mentions improvements in performance on English conversational and Japanese lecture corpora, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Switchboard Corpus**: This dataset is referenced as LDC97S62 and contains about 300 hours of conversational English telephone speech. The authors provide details about the training and evaluation sets used in their experiments.

2. **Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ)**: This dataset is noted as one of the largest Japanese spontaneous speech corpora, consisting of approximately 600 hours of spontaneous speech, with a focus on academic lectures.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Switchboard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John J Godfrey, Edward C Holliman, and Jane McDaniel. *SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 1992, pages 517â€“520.

- For the **Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ)**, the citation is:
  > Kikuo Maekawa. *Corpus of spontaneous Japanese: Its design and evaluation*. In ISCA & IEEE Workshop on Spontaneous Speech Processing and Recognition, 2003.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
