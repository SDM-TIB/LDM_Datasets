To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Control of Robotic Knee with Human in the Loop by Flexible Policy Iteration" by Xiang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the paper, the authors mention using **OpenSim** to simulate the dynamics of the human-prosthesis system. They also refer to data collected from two amputee subjects walking with prosthesis, which indicates that there are datasets derived from real human movement data.

I will also check the **references section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to previous studies or datasets that were used in their experiments.

Based on the information gathered, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **OpenSim Simulation Data**: This dataset is derived from the OpenSim software, which simulates human movements. The authors used this to model the dynamics of the robotic knee.

2. **Gait Data from Amputee Subjects**: The authors collected data from two amputee subjects (TF1 and TF2) during their walking trials. This dataset includes variations in gait patterns and is crucial for validating the proposed control algorithm.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **OpenSim Simulation Data**, I will reference the OpenSim website:
  > OpenSim. (n.d.). OpenSim: A software platform for modeling and simulating musculoskeletal systems. Retrieved from https://simtk.org/

- For the **Gait Data from Amputee Subjects**, I will cite the relevant study mentioned in the paper:
  > Brandt, A., Wen, Y., Liu, M., Stallings, J., & Huang, H. (2017). Interactions between transfemoral amputees and a powered knee prosthesis during load carriage. *Scientific Reports*, 7(1), 1-12. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-16405-6

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
