To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Play Learning Without a Reward Metric" by Dan Schmidt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the AlphaZero algorithm and its application to strategy games, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the algorithm but again does not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **method** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain information about any datasets used for training or evaluation. In the **method** section, the authors describe their approach to modifying the AlphaZero algorithm but do not mention any datasets. However, in the **experiments** section, they refer to the "opposition game" as a testbed for their method. This game is a conceptual framework rather than a dataset, so I will need to keep looking.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. The authors mention various algorithms and approaches, but they do not specify any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **appendix** and **references** sections. The appendix describes the experimental setup in detail, including the training process, but still does not mention any datasets. The references list includes citations for previous works, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or specific datasets for their experiments. Instead, they focused on a theoretical framework and a game designed for their research.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Opposition Game**: While not a dataset, it serves as the experimental framework for testing the modified AlphaZero algorithm.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any specific datasets, and the primary focus is on the theoretical contributions and experimental results derived from the opposition game.
