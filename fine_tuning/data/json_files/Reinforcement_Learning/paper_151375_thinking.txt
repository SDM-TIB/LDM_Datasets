To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced Cooperative Perception for Autonomous Vehicles Using Imperfect Communication" by Ahmad Sarlak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors created a dataset of annotated videos for different driving scenarios, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they developed over 2000 images with the CARLA simulator, which were manually annotated for pedestrian detection in foggy weather. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's purpose and the context in which it was created.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the CARLA simulator or any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The CARLA simulator is referenced, and I will need to provide its full citation as it is integral to the dataset creation.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **CARLA Simulator Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 2000 annotated images generated in the CARLA simulator, focusing on pedestrian detection in foggy weather conditions.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the CARLA simulator:

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16). PMLR.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This will ensure that the dataset is well-documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
