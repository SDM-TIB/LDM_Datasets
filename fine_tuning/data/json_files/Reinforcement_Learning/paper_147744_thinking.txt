To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An intriguing failing of convolutional neural networks and the CoordConv solution" by Rosanne Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the key datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the creation of a dataset called **Not-so-Clevr**, which is a single-object, grayscale version of the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **Not-so-Clevr dataset** in detail in **section 2**. Here, they explain that it consists of 3,136 examples of squares placed on a 64 × 64 canvas, with specific fields for center location, one-hot representation, and the resulting image.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original **Sort-of-CLEVR dataset** and the **Clevr dataset**. The citations for these datasets are crucial for proper attribution.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **Not-so-Clevr Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is introduced in their own work. However, I will note that it is a new dataset created by the authors.

2. **Sort-of-CLEVR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Li Fei-Fei, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Ross Girshick. *Clevr: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017 IEEE Conference on, pages 1988–1997, 2017.

3. **Clevr Dataset**: The citation is the same as above since the Sort-of-CLEVR is a simpler version of the Clevr dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
