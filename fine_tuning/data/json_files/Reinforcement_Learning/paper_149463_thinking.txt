To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Learning for MDPs with General Spaces" by Ali Devran Kara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section**, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, features).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant metrics or characteristics of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further research by others in the field.
