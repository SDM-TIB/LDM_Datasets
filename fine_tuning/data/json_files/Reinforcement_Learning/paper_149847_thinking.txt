To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empowering GNNs via Edge-Aware Weisfeiler-Leman Algorithm" by Meng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from **TUDatasets**, **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**, and **GNN Benchmark**. I will note these datasets and look for specific names and details in the text.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **COLLAB dataset**, I will look for the citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Morris, C., Rattan, G., & Mutzel, P. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This structured output will be ready for review or further processing.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
