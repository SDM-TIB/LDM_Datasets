To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heuristics, Answer Set Programming and Markov Decision Process for Solving a Set of Spatial Puzzles" by Thiago Freitas dos Santos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experiments that involve data collection.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss two specific puzzles: the **Fishermanâ€™s Folly** and the **Rope Ladder**. I will check if there are any datasets associated with these puzzles, such as datasets used for training or testing the algorithms described.

I will also look for any references to previous works or datasets in the **literature review** (Section 6) that might provide additional context or citations for datasets that were utilized in their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This includes checking the **References section** for any papers that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors reference datasets from previous studies, I will extract the full citation for those studies. If they created their own datasets, I will note the details provided in the paper and cite the paper itself as the source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that I have all necessary citations for future reference.
