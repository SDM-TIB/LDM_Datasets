To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust TOA-Based Localization in NLOS Environments" by Wenxin Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of TOA-based localization and mentions simulation and experimental results, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various methodologies and previous works, but I need to find explicit references to datasets used in their experiments.

In the **numerical results section (Section 4)**, the authors describe their experiments using both synthetic and real experimental data. They mention that they conducted simulations with a single-source localization setup involving 10 sensors and that they used real experimental data collected from a localization experiment at the University of Freiburg.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated synthetic data for their experiments, which involved simulating a single-source localization setup with 10 sensors in a 20 m × 20 m area. The dataset includes TOA-based range measurements and sensor positions, but specific details about the dataset (like how it was generated or the exact parameters used) are not provided.

2. **Real Experimental Data**: The authors collected real experimental data using Decawave DWM1000 modules in a 50 m × 50 m open area. They used five modules, four as sensors and one as the source. The dataset includes the positions of the sensors and reference points, as well as TOA-based range measurements. The exact positions of the sensors and reference points are provided in Table 3 of the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. However, the datasets themselves (synthetic and real) do not have formal citations since they are generated or collected specifically for this study.

For the **real experimental data**, I will cite the source of the Decawave DWM1000 modules as follows:
- Decawave. “DWM1000 datasheet.” [Online]. Available: https://www.decawave.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DWM1000-Datasheet.pdf

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is based on the authors' simulation setup.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Decawave DWM1000 modules as part of the real experimental data entry.
