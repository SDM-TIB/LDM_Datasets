To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search in Imperfect Information Games" by Martin Schmid, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments conducted. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset information.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional mentions of datasets, particularly if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on different datasets or compare results across datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For each dataset, I will document the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details about its structure or content.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have compiled this information, I will ensure that it is clearly organized and formatted for easy reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper citations for each.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
