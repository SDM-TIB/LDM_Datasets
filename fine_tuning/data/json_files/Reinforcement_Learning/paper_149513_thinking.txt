To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Deep Reinforcement Learning with Slower Online Network" by Kavosh Asadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed methods on the **Atari benchmark**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this benchmark.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments section, the authors mention using **55 Atari games** for their evaluations. This indicates that the Atari dataset is a key component of their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari benchmark. The Atari benchmark is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I expect to find a standard citation for it.

The citation for the Atari benchmark is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format. The key dataset identified is the **Atari benchmark**, which consists of various games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
