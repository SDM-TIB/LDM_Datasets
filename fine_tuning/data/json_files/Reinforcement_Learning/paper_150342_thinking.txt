To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accordion: A Communication-Aware Machine Learning Framework for Next Generation Networks" by Fadhel Ayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and performance evaluation sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments with the ResNet architectures. They provide details about these datasets, such as the number of classes and images per class, which are crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical Report, 2009.

Both datasets are part of the same technical report, which is important to note.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
