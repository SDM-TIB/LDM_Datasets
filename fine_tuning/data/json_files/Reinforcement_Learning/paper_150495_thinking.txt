To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum deep Q learning with distributed prioritized experience replay" by Samuel Yen-Chi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed framework but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are described. In this section, the authors mention using the **Cart-Pole environment from OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. This is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Cart-Pole environment. The authors cite the OpenAI Gym paper, which is crucial for providing the complete reference for the dataset.

The citation for the **OpenAI Gym** is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (2016).

Additionally, the paper mentions a modified version of the Cart-Pole environment called **CartPoleMod**, which is also important to document. I will need to find the citation for this specific implementation as well.

The citation for **CartPoleMod** is:
> Ravindran, A. "gym-cartpolemod." https://github.com/AadityaRavindran/gym-cartpolemod (2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Cart-Pole Environment**: A standard evaluation environment in OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning models.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (2016).

2. **CartPoleMod**: A modified version of the Cart-Pole environment that accounts for friction.
   - Citation: Ravindran, A. "gym-cartpolemod." https://github.com/AadityaRavindran/gym-cartpolemod (2017).

With this information, I am now ready to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
