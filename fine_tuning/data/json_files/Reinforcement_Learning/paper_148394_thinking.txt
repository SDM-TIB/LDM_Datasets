To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dark Experience for General Continual Learning: a Strong, Simple Baseline" by Pietro Buzzega et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting an extensive analysis on both standard benchmarks and a novel GCL evaluation setting (MNIST-360), indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with 500 training images per class.
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
4. **MNIST-360**: A novel dataset proposed in this paper, which presents MNIST digits sequentially with increasing rotation angles, creating both sudden and gradual changes in their distribution.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge (CS231n)*, 2015. http://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **MNIST-360**, since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Pietro Buzzega, Matteo Boschini, Angelo Porrello, Davide Abati, Simone Calderara. *Dark Experience for General Continual Learning: a Strong, Simple Baseline*. In Proceedings of the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper references.
