To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Planning and Control in Vision Based Robotics via Reward Machines" by Alberto Camacho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they typically detail the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. For instance, if the authors describe tasks such as "stacking blocks" or "kitting tasks," I will check if they reference any datasets that were used to train or evaluate their models. If they mention using demonstrations, I will note how these demonstrations were collected and whether they are part of a publicly available dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "PyBullet," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note that as well and provide a brief description of its relevance based on the context provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction process. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
