To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Additive Manufacturing through Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review of Current Progress and Future Challenges" by Amirul Islam Saimon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. If the authors reference any datasets used in their review or analysis, I will note them down. 

I will then check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, particularly in sections that summarize findings or methodologies. For example, **Table 1** lists review articles, and **Table 2** contains keywords, but I will specifically look for any tables that might summarize datasets used in the studies reviewed.

In the **background and methodology sections**, I will look for any descriptions of datasets used in the studies cited by the authors. This includes checking for any references to datasets in the context of deep learning applications in additive manufacturing.

Once I identify datasets, I will ensure to gather the necessary details for each dataset, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references section to ensure I have the correct and complete reference.

After compiling the information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited. This will facilitate easy access to the datasets for future research or validation purposes.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and correctly formatted.
