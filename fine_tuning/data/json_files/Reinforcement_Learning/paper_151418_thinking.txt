To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IgCONDA-PET: Implicitly-Guided Counterfactual Diffusion for Detecting Anomalies in PET Images" by Shadab Ahamed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the importance of minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research. The introduction further discusses the segmentation of cancerous anomalies from PET images, indicating that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this case, the authors state that they used two publicly available and densely annotated oncological FDG PET datasets: **AutoPET** and **HECKTOR**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including the number of samples and the types of cancer they include.

1. **AutoPET Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,014 samples and includes three cancer phenotypes: lymphoma, lung cancer, and melanoma, as well as healthy control patients.

2. **HECKTOR Dataset**: This dataset contains 524 samples of patients presenting with head and neck cancer.

The authors also mention how these datasets were pooled together for training, validation, and testing, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **AutoPET Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gatidis, S., Hepp, T., Frueh, M., La Fougere, C., Nikolaou, K., Pfannenberg, C., Schölkopf, B., Küstner, T., Cyran, C., Rubin, D. (2022). A whole-body FDG-PET/CT dataset with manually annotated tumor lesions. *Scientific Data*, 9(1), 601.

- For the **HECKTOR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrearczyk, V., Oreiller, V., Boughdad, S., Rest, C.C.L., Elhalawani, H., Jreige, M., Prior, J.O., Vallieres, M., Visvikis, D., Hatt, M., et al. (2021). Overview of the HECKTOR challenge at MICCAI 2021: automatic head and neck tumor segmentation and outcome prediction in PET/CT images. In *3D Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation in PET/CT Challenge*, pp. 1–37. Springer.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
