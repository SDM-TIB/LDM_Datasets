To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible Diffusion Modeling of Long Videos" by William Harvey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate improved video modeling on several datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (CARLA Town01 Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about a new dataset they created. This section describes the dataset's characteristics, including the number of videos, their length, and the resolution. The dataset consists of 408 training and 100 test videos, each 1000 frames long, produced in the CARLA Town01 environment.

Additionally, I will check **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention using three datasets for their experiments: **GQN-Mazes**, **MineRL Navigate**, and the **CARLA Town01 dataset**. Each dataset is described in terms of its length and the nature of the videos it contains.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CARLA Town01 Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 1-16.

2. **GQN-Mazes Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Eslami, S. M. A., Jimenez Rezende, D., Besse, F., Viola, F., Morcos, A. S., Garnelo, M., Ruderman, A., Rusu, A. A., Danihelka, I., Gregor, K., et al. (2018). *Neural scene representation and rendering*. Science, 360(6394), 1204-1210.

3. **MineRL Navigate Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Guss, W. H., Houghton, B., Topin, N., Wang, P., Codel, C., Veloso, M., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2019). *MineRL: A large-scale dataset of Minecraft demonstrations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.13440.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
