To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Counterfactual Explanations for Scorecard Modelling" by Guillermo Navas-Palencia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "Experiments on two real-world datasets confirm that the presented approach can generate optimal diverse counterfactuals." This indicates that there are at least two datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In **section 3.2**, the author explicitly states that two datasets are used for evaluation:

1. **FICO Dataset**: This dataset is described as an anonymized dataset from the FICO Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, containing real Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications. The task is to predict whether individuals will repay their HELOC account within 2 years.

2. **Adult-Income Dataset**: This dataset is based on the 1994 Census database and includes information about individuals, with the task of classifying whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FICO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > FICO, Google, UC Irvine, Imperial College London, MIT, and University of Oxford. *Explainable Machine Learning Challenge*. Available at: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge, 2018.

- For the **Adult-Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Kohavi and B. Becker. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult, 1996.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **FICO Dataset**: Anonymized dataset from the FICO Explainable Machine Learning Challenge for predicting HELOC repayment.
   - Citation: FICO, Google, UC Irvine, Imperial College London, MIT, and University of Oxford. *Explainable Machine Learning Challenge*. Available at: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge, 2018.

2. **Adult-Income Dataset**: Dataset based on the 1994 Census database for classifying income levels.
   - Citation: R. Kohavi and B. Becker. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult, 1996.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
