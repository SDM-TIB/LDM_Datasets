To extract datasets from the research paper titled "6G Fresnel Spot Beamfocusing using Large-Scale Metasurfaces: A Distributed DRL-Based Approach" by Mehdi Monemi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments, including details about their size, structure, and any specific characteristics. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. I will note any datasets mentioned in these sections.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the performance evaluation of the proposed methods, such as simulation results or experimental data. If the authors mention any publicly available datasets, I will note those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
