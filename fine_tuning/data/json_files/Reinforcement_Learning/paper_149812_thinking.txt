To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impartial Games: A Challenge for Reinforcement Learning" by Bei Zhou and SÃ¸ren Riis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges faced by AlphaZero-style algorithms in impartial games, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of the games and the performance of algorithms without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section, as this is often where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors describe their implementation of an AlphaZero-style algorithm for the Nim game and mention various configurations and settings, but they do not provide specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also look for any **appendices** or **supplementary materials** that might contain additional information about datasets. However, the paper does not seem to include any such sections.

Since the paper primarily discusses theoretical aspects and algorithmic challenges without referencing specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Finally, I will ensure to check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets used in related works. However, the focus remains on the theoretical exploration of the Nim game and the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms rather than empirical datasets.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will note that no specific datasets were identified for extraction, and thus, there are no citations to provide for datasets in this context.
