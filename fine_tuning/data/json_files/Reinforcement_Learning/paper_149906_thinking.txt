To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IBISCape: A Simulated Benchmark for multi-modal SLAM Systems Evaluation in Large-scale Dynamic Environments" by Abanob Soliman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a benchmark called **IBISCape**, which includes 34 multi-modal datasets suitable for autonomous vehicle navigation. This suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the **IBISCape benchmark** and the **data acquisition APIs**. Here, they mention that the benchmark includes data from various sensors and scenarios, which implies that these datasets are integral to their research.

In the **results and evaluation sections**, the authors discuss the performance of different SLAM systems using the IBISCape sequences. They provide details about the sequences, including their characteristics and the conditions under which they were collected. This section will likely contain specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

I will also check the **tables** presented in the paper, particularly **Table 3**, which outlines the distribution of IBISCape sequences with different sensor modalities and configurations. This table will provide concrete details about the datasets, including the number of sequences and their environmental conditions.

After gathering the necessary information, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various works related to SLAM and sensor calibration, which may include foundational datasets that are relevant to the IBISCape benchmark.

The datasets I will extract include:

1. **IBISCape Benchmark**: A simulated benchmark that includes 34 sequences for multi-modal VI-SLAM applications.
   - Citation: Soliman, A., Bonardi, F., Sidib√©, D., & Bouchafa, S. (2022). *IBISCape: A Simulated Benchmark for multi-modal SLAM Systems Evaluation in Large-scale Dynamic Environments*. 

2. **CARLA Simulator**: The benchmark is built upon the CARLA simulator, which is used for generating the datasets.
   - Citation: Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning.

3. **Calibration Targets**: The paper introduces calibration targets for the CARLA maps, which are essential for the datasets.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and the conditions under which it was collected, along with the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
