To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Desiderata for normative models of synaptic plasticity" by Colin Bredenberg and Cristina Savin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention any datasets used or referenced. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training or validation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or text that reference specific datasets.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been highlighted earlier in the paper. Authors sometimes reflect on their data sources or compare their findings to existing datasets in this section.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for the **references section** of the paper. This section is crucial for obtaining full citations for each dataset. I will cross-reference any dataset names I found in the previous sections with the references to ensure I have the correct citation information.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are not widely known or are specific to the authors' research, I will ensure to note down any relevant details such as the dataset's purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted in the text.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details that would help someone locate the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
