To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Path Planning based on MPC and DDPG" by Junxiao Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **Unity 3D to perform simulation experiments**, which suggests that there might be datasets related to the simulations conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation section** (Section III), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention two specific environments used for simulation:

1. **Aircraft Carrier Deck Simulation**: This section describes the setup, including the number of dynamic and static obstacles, and how the agent navigates through them. The authors provide visual representations of the trajectories, which indicates that data was collected during these simulations.

2. **Crowd Square Simulation**: Similar to the previous section, this part details the setup for simulating pedestrian movement and obstacle avoidance. The authors describe the number of obstacles and the agent's behavior in this environment.

In both sections, the authors do not explicitly name datasets but describe the simulation scenarios in detail, implying that the data generated during these simulations could be considered as datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets or simulation environments used. However, since the paper primarily discusses simulations rather than publicly available datasets, I will note that the datasets are likely generated from the simulations described rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Since there are no specific datasets with full citations provided in the paper, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Dataset from Aircraft Carrier Deck Simulation**: This dataset includes trajectories of the carrier-based aircraft and dynamic obstacles, generated during the simulation in Unity 3D.

- **Dataset from Crowd Square Simulation**: This dataset includes trajectories of pedestrians and the agent, also generated during the Unity 3D simulation.

I will note that these datasets are not publicly available and are specific to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets derived from the simulations, even though they do not have formal citations like traditional datasets.
