To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Application of the Target Trial Causal Framework and Machine Learning Modeling to Optimize Antibiotic Therapy: Use Case on Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus" by Inyoung Jun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage large-scale, real-world electronic health record (EHR) data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically looking for details about the data source and the population settings. The authors mention using data from the **University of Florida Health’s Integrated Data Repository (IDR)**, which is a crucial dataset for their analysis. They describe the inclusion criteria for patients diagnosed with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which provides context for the dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific numbers regarding the patient population, stating that they analyzed EHR data from **53,304 unique patients** between 2011 and 2018. They further refine this to **1,041 individuals** who met the target trial criteria, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or clarifications regarding the dataset. The authors discuss the implications of their findings based on the dataset, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the **University of Florida Health’s Integrated Data Repository (IDR)**, the citation is:
  > Jun, I., Marini, S., Morris, J. G., Bian, J., Boucher, C. A., & Prosperi, M. (2022). Joint Application of the Target Trial Causal Framework and Machine Learning Modeling to Optimize Antibiotic Therapy: Use Case on Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In Proceedings of the DSHealth Conference, Washington D.C, USA.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's origin and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
