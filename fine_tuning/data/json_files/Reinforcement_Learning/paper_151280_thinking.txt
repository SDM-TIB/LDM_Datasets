To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certifying Robustness of Multi-Sensor Fusion Systems against Semantic Attacks" by Zijian Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulation platform** for benchmarking certified robustness, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this platform.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their dataset construction. In this section, they mention the creation of a **KITTI-CARLA dataset** specifically for their experiments. The details provided indicate that this dataset consists of 5,000 frames generated in CARLA Town01, with specific configurations for training and testing.

I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **KITTI-CARLA Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using the CARLA simulator and includes 5,000 frames, with 3,500 frames designated for training and 1,500 frames for testing. The dataset is designed to evaluate the robustness of multi-sensor fusion systems against semantic transformations.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors refer to the original KITTI dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of autonomous driving. The citation for the KITTI dataset is:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Since the authors created a variant of this dataset (KITTI-CARLA), I will also note that the original KITTI dataset citation is relevant for referencing the dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
