To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experimenting with Constraint Programming on GPU" by Fabio Tardivo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodologies, experiments, or results. In this case, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. I will pay close attention to sections that describe the implementation of the constraint solver, as they may reference datasets used for testing or validation.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, such as a "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup" section, I will focus on that to gather detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CUBICS" or any other specific datasets used in the experiments, I will ensure to find the original source or publication that describes that dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
