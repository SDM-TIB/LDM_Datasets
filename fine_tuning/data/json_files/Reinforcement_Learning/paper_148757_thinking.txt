To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging the Variance of Return Sequences for Exploration Policy" by Zerong Xi and Gita Sukthankar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Atari game benchmark** for their experiments. I will need to identify the specific datasets or environments within this benchmark that were used. The paper states that they evaluated their methods on **55 Atari games** from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). This indicates that the dataset consists of multiple games, which I will need to enumerate.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the Atari games are part of a well-known benchmark, I will look for the original citation for the Arcade Learning Environment.

The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:
> Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, May 2013.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment as the authoritative source for the dataset.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Note the mention of the Atari game benchmark and the number of games involved.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information and citations for clarity and completeness.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
