To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration via Epistemic Value Estimation" by Simon Schmitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors observe competitive performance on a series of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, the authors refer to the **Bsuite benchmark** and specifically mention the **Deep Sea environment** as a key evaluation metric. I will note these as they are likely datasets or environments used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future readers.

1. **Bsuite**: The citation for the Bsuite benchmark is:
   > Osband, I., Aslanides, J., & Cassirer, A. (2020). Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

2. **Deep Sea**: The citation for the Deep Sea environment is:
   > Osband, I., Aslanides, J., & Cassirer, A. (2018). Randomized Prior Functions for Deep Reinforcement Learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
