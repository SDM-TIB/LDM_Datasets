To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Distribution-aware Sampling for Deep Q-learning" by Weichao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on classic control tasks and Atari 2600 games based on the OpenAI gym platform. This indicates that there are datasets related to these tasks, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to find explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention conducting experiments on classic control tasks such as **Acrobot**, **MountainCar**, and **LunarLander**, as well as Atari 2600 games like **BattleZone**, **Atlantis**, and **Amidar**. These names suggest that they are the datasets used for evaluation.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper references the OpenAI gym platform, which is a well-known framework for reinforcement learning that includes various environments and datasets. 

For the classic control tasks, the datasets are typically part of the OpenAI gym, and I can cite the relevant reference for the gym itself:
- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

For the Atari 2600 games, these are also part of the OpenAI gym, and the same citation applies.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations:

1. **Classic Control Tasks**:
   - **Acrobot**: Part of the OpenAI gym.
   - **MountainCar**: Part of the OpenAI gym.
   - **LunarLander**: Part of the OpenAI gym.

2. **Atari 2600 Games**:
   - **BattleZone**: Part of the OpenAI gym.
   - **Atlantis**: Part of the OpenAI gym.
   - **Amidar**: Part of the OpenAI gym.

Since all these datasets are part of the OpenAI gym, I will use the same citation for each of them.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
