To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformal Inference of Counterfactuals and Individual Treatment Effects" by Lihua Lei and Emmanuel J. Cand√®s, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the datasets used for their analyses. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings of the study. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets identified earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "National Study of Learning Mindsets (NLSM)", I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly to facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the datasets extracted from the paper. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
