To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating Natural Language to SQL using Pointer-Generator Networks and How Decoding Order Matters" by Denis Lukovnikov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on the **WIKISQL dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the significance of semantic parsing for question answering over structured data and reference various works that utilize datasets for this purpose. However, the most relevant dataset is likely to be WIKISQL, as it is explicitly mentioned in the context of their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors confirm that they used the **WIKISQL dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing natural language questions, their SQL equivalents, and the tables against which the SQL queries should be executed. This section provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WIKISQL dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **WIKISQL**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, V., Xiong, C., and Socher, R. (2017). *Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.00103.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are accurately represented.
