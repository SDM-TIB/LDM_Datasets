To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BONES: a Benchmark fOr Neural Estimation of Shapley values" by Davide Napolitano and Luca Cagliero, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section specifically dedicated to datasets**. The abstract mentions that BONES provides a set of commonly used benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section III (THE BONES BENCHMARK)**, where the authors describe the components of BONES. In this section, they explicitly mention that BONES includes a set of benchmark datasets for both tabular and image data. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

In **subsection III.A (Datasets)**, the authors provide a table (Table I) that lists the datasets included in BONES. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Monks**: A dataset from the UCI repository with 302 training samples, 9469 validation samples, and 6 features.
2. **WBC (Wisconsin Breast Cancer)**: Another UCI dataset with 436 training samples, 5879 validation samples, and 9 features.
3. **Census**: A dataset from SHAP with 20838 training samples, 5210 validation samples, and 12 features.
4. **Credit**: A UCI dataset with 19200 training samples, 4800 validation samples, and 23 features.
5. **Magic**: A UCI dataset with 12172 training samples, 3044 validation samples, and 10 features.
6. **ImageNette**: A dataset used for image classification, with a resolution of 224x224 pixels.
7. **Pet**: Another image dataset, also with a resolution of 224x224 pixels.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Monks**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

- For **WBC**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

- For **Census**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

- For **Credit**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

- For **Magic**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2013.

- For **ImageNette**:
  > J. Howard and S. Gugger. *Fastai: a layered api for deep learning*. Information, vol. 11, no. 2, p. 108, 2020.

- For **Pet**:
  > O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman, and C. Jawahar. *Cats and dogs*. In 2012 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 3498â€“3505, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
