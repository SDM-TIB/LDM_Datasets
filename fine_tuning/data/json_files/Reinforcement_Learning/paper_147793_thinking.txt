To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Quality-Value (DQV) Learning" by Matthia Sabatelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing the DQV algorithm on various environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They mention two groups of environments: one consisting of classic control problems (Acrobot and Cartpole) and another involving Atari 2600 games (Pong, Enduro, Boxing, and Ice-Hockey). These environments are crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide insights into the performance of DQV on these environments, confirming that they are indeed the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets by referring to the references section of the paper and any relevant external sources:

1. **Acrobot Environment**: The Acrobot is a classic control problem in reinforcement learning. The citation for the original formulation of the Acrobot can be found in the OpenAI Gym documentation:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Cartpole Environment**: Similar to Acrobot, Cartpole is also part of the OpenAI Gym. The citation is the same as for Acrobot:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

3. **Atari 2600 Games**: The authors mention four specific Atari games: Pong, Enduro, Boxing, and Ice-Hockey. These games are also part of the OpenAI Gym package, and the citation remains consistent:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in the required format for further processing or review.
