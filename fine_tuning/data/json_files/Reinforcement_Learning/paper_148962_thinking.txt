To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic algorithm for feature selection of EEG heterogeneous data" by Aurora Saibene and Francesca Gasparini, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they used "two publicly available datasets on cognitive workload and motor movement/imagery," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The introduction mentions the challenges of EEG data and hints at the datasets being used for feature selection and analysis.

I will then focus on **section 3 (Materials description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets. Here, they introduce:

1. **EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset (Dataset A)**: This dataset is referenced as coming from Zyma et al. (2019) and Goldberger et al. (2000). It includes EEG recordings from 36 participants during two conditions: a resting phase and a mental arithmetic task.

2. **EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (Dataset B)**: This dataset is referenced as coming from Schalk et al. (2004) and Goldberger et al. (2000). It consists of recordings from 109 participants performing various motor tasks.

In the **summary table (Table 1)**, the authors provide a concise overview of both datasets, including their characteristics, which further confirms the details I need.

Next, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Dataset A** (EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks):
  > Zyma, I., Tukaev, S., Seleznov, I., Kiyono, K., Popov, A., Chernykh, M., & Shpenkov, O. (2019). Electroencephalograms during mental arithmetic task performance. *Data*, 4, 14.

- For **Dataset B** (EEG Motor Movement/Imagery):
  > Schalk, G., McFarland, D. J., Hinterberger, T., Birbaumer, N., & Wolpaw, J. R. (2004). BCI2000: a general-purpose brain-computer interface (BCI) system. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 51, 1034â€“1043.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
