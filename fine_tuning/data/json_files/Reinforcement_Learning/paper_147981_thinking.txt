To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Learning of Dynamical Systems in Uncertain Environment: A Tutorial" by Mehran Attar and Mohammad Reza Dabirian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their examples or discussions. If they refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

I will then examine the **subsequent sections**, particularly those that discuss algorithms or methodologies, as they may include references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. I will look for any figures, tables, or examples that might indicate the use of specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper discusses well-known datasets, I will ensure to include their standard citations. If the authors introduce new datasets, I will extract the necessary details to create a citation for them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining academic integrity through proper citation.
