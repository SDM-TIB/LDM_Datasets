To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimistic Reinforcement Learning by Forward Kullback-Leibler Divergence Optimization" by Taisuke Kobayashi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the experiments conducted, which can lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets that the authors utilized in their experiments.

In this paper, the author mentions conducting numerical simulations using **Pybullet** and references specific environments like **InvertedDoublePendulumBulletEnv-v0**, **HopperBulletEnv-v0**, and **MinitaurBulletEnv-v0**. These environments are often associated with specific datasets or benchmarks in reinforcement learning contexts.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or environments mentioned. This is crucial for obtaining full citations, which are necessary for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper references the **OpenAI Gym** or **Pybullet**, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these environments. The citations for these would be:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Pybullet**:
  > Coumans, E., Bai, Y. (2016). *Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. GitHub repository.

After identifying the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and formatted correctly for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.
