To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attack of the Genes: Finding Keys and Parameters of Locked Analog ICs Using Genetic Algorithm" by Rabin Yu Acharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are utilized in their experiments.

In the **methodology** section, I will examine the details of the experiments conducted. This section typically outlines the specific datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any named datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that describe how they were used in the experiments.

The **experimental results** section is crucial, as it often summarizes the findings based on the datasets used. I will check for any tables or figures that might list the datasets along with their performance metrics or outcomes from the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific benchmark dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that describes that dataset and extract the citation details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes proper citations for each dataset.
