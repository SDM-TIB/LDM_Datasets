To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Q-Learning" by Prashant G. Mehta and Sean P. Meyn, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a summary of the research, and if datasets are used, they are often mentioned here. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their sizes, types, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Mountain Car Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the dataset online or in related literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
