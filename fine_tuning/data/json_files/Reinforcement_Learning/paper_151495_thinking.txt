To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Learning as a Monotone Scheme" by Lingyi Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses stability issues in reinforcement learning and mentions examining a linear quadratic example, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses. The introduction discusses the theoretical background and mentions previous works but does not specify any datasets.

Then, I will check the **experiments** section, which is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, there is no dedicated section labeled "Datasets," but I will look for any subsections or mentions of datasets within the experiments. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might reference datasets used for validation or testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments. Instead, the focus is on theoretical analysis and numerical methods related to Q-learning and monotonicity. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Since no datasets are mentioned, I will not need to look for citations. However, I will still check the **References section** to ensure that there are no overlooked datasets that might be referenced indirectly.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract, and thus no citations are necessary. This process highlights the importance of careful reading and attention to detail when extracting information from research papers.
