To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Reasoning across the Causal Hierarchy" by Duligur Ibeling and Thomas Icard, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the conceptual framework of causal reasoning but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

I will look for a section that explicitly mentions datasets, often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. If such a section exists, I will carefully read through it to identify the names and descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will search for any mentions of datasets throughout the **results** and **discussion** sections. Authors may refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results to previous work.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the complete citations for each dataset mentioned.

If I find datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Clearly state the name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: Include the complete citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.

If no datasets are found throughout the paper, I will note that as well, indicating that the research may not have utilized any external datasets for its analysis.
