To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Realistic Evaluation of Evasion Attacks using CARLA" by Cory Cornelius et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention using **CARLA**, which is a driving simulator, but I need to determine if there are any specific datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses adversarial attacks and references **ShapeShifter**, but again, I need to look for explicit dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, if available, to see if the authors describe any datasets used in their experiments or evaluations. In this paper, the authors reference **ShapeShifter** and its application to the **MS-COCO dataset** for training the object detector. This indicates that the MS-COCO dataset is relevant to their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MS-COCO dataset**. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is typically attributed to the following paper:

> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily focus on the **CARLA simulator**, which is also referenced as a dataset for creating realistic scenarios. I will find its citation in the references:

> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1â€“16, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: Used for training the Faster R-CNN object detector in the context of adversarial attacks.
2. **CARLA Simulator**: An open-source simulator used to create realistic driving scenarios for testing adversarial attacks.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets ready for inclusion in the final output.

After completing these steps, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details and citations are included for clarity and completeness.
