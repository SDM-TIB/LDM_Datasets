To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Curiosity Search: Intra-Life Exploration Can Improve Performance on Challenging Deep Reinforcement Learning Problems" by Christopher Stanton and Jeff Clune, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks. The introduction highlights the challenges of reinforcement learning in sparse-reward environments, particularly mentioning "Montezuma’s Revenge" and "Seaquest." This indicates that these games are likely part of the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets or game environments. The authors state that they primarily examine performance on two Atari games: **Montezuma’s Revenge** and **Seaquest**. They also mention evaluating on ten additional games: **Alien, Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, Kangaroo, Private Eye, Pitfall, Tutankham, Venture, and Wizard of Wor**. This confirms that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these games, further validating that they are indeed the datasets used for evaluation. They compare their method against other algorithms on these games, which reinforces their significance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since these games are well-known, I will refer to the original sources or relevant literature for their citations:
