To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning by Competition of Self-Interested Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Stephen Chung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that are provided.

In this paper, I notice that the author mentions four reinforcement learning tasks: **Multiplexer, CartPole, Acrobot, and LunarLander**. I will take note of these tasks as they may correspond to datasets or environments used in the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. In this case, the paper references the OpenAI Gym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Additionally, I will note that the specific tasks (Multiplexer, CartPole, Acrobot, and LunarLander) are standard environments in reinforcement learning, and they are often associated with the OpenAI Gym toolkit. However, they do not have separate dataset citations as they are part of the Gym framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the OpenAI Gym toolkit and any relevant details about the tasks used in the experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used in the experiments.
