To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Learning with Differential Entropy of Q-Tables" by Tung D. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental description** section, as this is where the authors typically detail the tasks and datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention a modified version of the **Maze problem** and a **Flag Collection Task**. I will need to determine if these tasks are associated with any publicly available datasets or if they are original datasets created for the purpose of this research.

In the **experimental description**, the authors describe the **Flag Collection Task** in detail, indicating that it is a gridworld problem where the agent collects flags. However, it appears that this task is not based on an existing dataset but rather a simulation created by the authors. Therefore, I will note that while the task is significant, it does not correspond to a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or prior works that may have provided datasets for similar tasks. However, since the paper primarily discusses the methodology and results of their experiments without referencing external datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets cited in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Maze Problem**: A modified version of the Maze problem is used, but it is not a publicly available dataset.
2. **Flag Collection Task**: This task is described in detail but is also not based on an existing dataset.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to extract, I will document this conclusion clearly, emphasizing that the experiments were conducted using original tasks designed by the authors rather than established datasets.

In summary, I will prepare a concise note indicating the absence of publicly available datasets in the paper while acknowledging the original tasks used for experimentation.
