To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Imbalanced Classification" by Enlu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem being addressed, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **IMDB**: A text dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). The authors specify that the reviews have been preprocessed and encoded as sequences of word indexes.

2. **Cifar-10**: A complex image dataset containing 32x32 color images with 10 classes of natural objects. The authors describe two simulated datasets extracted from Cifar-10, specifying the positive and negative classes.

3. **Mnist**: A well-known dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The authors indicate that the images with label 2 are treated as the positive class.

4. **Fashion-Mnist**: A dataset designed as a drop-in replacement for the original Mnist dataset, comprising 28x28 grayscale images of fashion products across 10 categories. The authors describe two simulated datasets derived from Fashion-Mnist.

I will also check the **table (Table I)** that summarizes the datasets used in the experiments, which includes details such as the number of samples and the imbalance ratios.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will look for include:

- For **IMDB**, I will reference the original dataset paper or source.
- For **Cifar-10**, I will find the citation for the original dataset paper.
- For **Mnist**, I will cite the original paper that introduced the dataset.
- For **Fashion-Mnist**, I will look for the citation that describes this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
