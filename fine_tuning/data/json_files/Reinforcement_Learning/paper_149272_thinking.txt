To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Podcast Metadata and Content: Episode Relevance and Attractiveness in Ad Hoc Search" by Ben Carterette et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (TREC 2020 Podcasts Track)**, as it appears to be the section where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. Here, they mention the use of a test collection from the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track, which includes 100,000 podcast episodes released in 2019. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. The authors discuss various assessments and retrieval techniques, but the primary dataset seems to be the one from the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track is:

- For the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track, the citation is:
  > Rosie Jones, Ben Carterette, Ann Clifton, Maria Eskevich, Gareth Jones, Jussi Karlgren, Aasish Pappu, Sravana Reddy, and Yongze Yu. *Overview of the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track*. In Proceedings of the TREC, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
