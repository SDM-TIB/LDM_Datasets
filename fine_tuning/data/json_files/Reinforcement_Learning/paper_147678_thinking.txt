To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Internet of Things Applications: Animal Monitoring with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" by Jun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard tortoises, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the paper, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **ZebraNet Dataset**: This dataset contains location information of 5 zebras in June 2005 near Nanyuki, Kenya, with a sampling time of 10 minutes over a total experiment time of 14 days.

2. **Leopard Tortoises Dataset**: This dataset includes movement traces of 10 leopard tortoises in the Kalahari Desert, recorded over three months from January to March 2013, with a sampling time of 60 minutes.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For the **ZebraNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Juang, H. Oki, Y. Wang, M. Martonosi, L. S. Peh, and D. Rubenstein. *Energy-efficient computing for wildlife tracking: Design tradeoffs and early experiences with zebranet*. SIGARCH Comput. Archit. News, vol. 30, no. 5, pp. 96â€“107, December 2002.

- For the **Leopard Tortoises Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will note that it may require further investigation or may be referenced in related works.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
