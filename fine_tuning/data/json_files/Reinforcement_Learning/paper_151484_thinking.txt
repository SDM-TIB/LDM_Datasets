To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matrix Low-Rank Trust Region Policy Optimization" by Sergio Rozada and Antonio G. Marques, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically discussed in detail.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will look for any references to specific datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm. The authors mention testing their TRLRPO algorithm on three continuous-action problems from the OpenAI Gym: 

1. **Inverted Pendulum**: This is a classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pendulum on a cart.
2. **Acrobot**: A double pendulum that needs to swing up to a certain position.
3. **Mountain Car**: An environment where the agent must build momentum to reach the top of a hill.

Next, I will verify if the authors provide any specific dataset citations or references in the **References section**. In this case, the datasets are part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit, which is a well-known framework for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, I will need to cite the OpenAI Gym paper as the source for these environments.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clearly defined and include all necessary citations for future reference or processing.
