To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Natural Extension To Online Algorithms For Hybrid RL With Limited Coverage" by Kevin Tan and Ziping Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were collected.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss the **numerical simulations** or **case studies**, as these often include specific datasets used for testing the proposed algorithms. I will note any datasets that are mentioned in the context of experiments or results.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Forest Management Simulator" or "Tetris Game Dataset," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, which will be useful for further research or replication of the study.
