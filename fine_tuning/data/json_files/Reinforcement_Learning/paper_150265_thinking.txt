To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taming Lagrangian Chaos with Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning" by Chiara Calascibetta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or benchmarks. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss experimental setups or data collection. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. However, upon reviewing the provided text, it appears that the authors do not specify any datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **acknowledgments** sections for any mentions of datasets or data sources. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not provide additional information about datasets.

Since the paper states in the **data availability statement** that "Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study," it confirms that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will compile my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were mentioned or utilized in the research.**
2. **The paper explicitly states that no datasets were generated or analyzed.**

As a result, there are no citations to provide for datasets, as none exist in this paper. I will conclude my extraction process here, noting the absence of datasets in the research.
