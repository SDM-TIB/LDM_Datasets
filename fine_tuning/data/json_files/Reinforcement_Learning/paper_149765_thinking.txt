To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional β-VAE for De Novo Molecular Generation" by Ryan J. Richards and Austen M. Groener, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **ZINC-250k dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of druglikeness and virtual screening, but the key dataset is likely to be mentioned in the context of their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **ZINC-250k dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as constructed from 250,000 random samples from the ZINC database, which provides a clear definition of the dataset's origin and purpose.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the ZINC-250k dataset is consistently referenced throughout the experiments, which it is, as they report results based on this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ZINC-250k dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ZINC-250k dataset**:
  > J. Wang, Z. Liu, Y. Zhang, and A. Aspuru-Guzik. *ZINC: A Free Database of Commercially Available Compounds for Virtual Screening*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 55(12): 2324-2337, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **ZINC-250k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 250,000 random samples from the ZINC database, used for evaluating the performance of the proposed β-CVAE model in generating valid molecular structures.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
