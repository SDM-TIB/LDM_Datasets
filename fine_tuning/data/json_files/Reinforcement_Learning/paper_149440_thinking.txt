To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-Policy Correction for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms via Batch Prioritized Experience Replay" by Dogan C. Cicek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be useful.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on **OpenAI Gymâ€™s continuous control tasks**. This indicates that there are specific datasets or environments they are using for their experiments.

I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of specific environments in the experiments. In this case, the authors refer to six different continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym, which are:

1. **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**
2. **Hopper-v2**
3. **InvertedPendulum-v2**
4. **Reacher-v2**
5. **Walker2d-v2**
6. **HalfCheetah-v2**

These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is the source of the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
