To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Online Video Frame Subset Selection using Multiple Criteria for Data Efficient Autonomous Driving" by Soumi Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions key datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss using a dataset collected from the CARLA simulator, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3). Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments in detail. They mention that they collected data from the CARLA simulator, specifically stating that the dataset comprises **262 driving episodes and a total of 100,000 video frames**. This is a crucial piece of information that I need to document.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets or sources in the **related work section** or throughout the paper. However, it seems that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the one generated from the CARLA simulator.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the dataset used. The relevant citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **CARLA Driving Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100,000 video frames collected from 262 driving episodes using the CARLA simulator. The dataset includes various affordances such as discrete and continuous values relevant to autonomous driving tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and completeness, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
