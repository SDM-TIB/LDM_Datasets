To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Misleading Authorship Attribution of Source Code using Adversarial Learning" by Erwin Quiring, Alwin Maier, and Konrad Rieck, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their empirical evaluation setup. Here, they mention using source code from the **2017 Google Code Jam (GCJ)** programming competition, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of files and authors involved.

In the **dataset description**, the authors specify that they collected **1,632 C++ files from 204 authors** who participated in the GCJ competition. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and relevance.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a public competition, I will ensure to cite it correctly. The citation for the Google Code Jam can be formatted as follows:

- **Google Code Jam Dataset**:
  > Google Code Jam. *Google Code Jam*. Available at: https://code.google.com/codejam/, last visited May 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Google Code Jam Dataset**: This dataset consists of C++ source code files collected from the 2017 Google Code Jam competition, including 1,632 files from 204 authors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This includes ensuring that the dataset citation is complete and correctly formatted.
