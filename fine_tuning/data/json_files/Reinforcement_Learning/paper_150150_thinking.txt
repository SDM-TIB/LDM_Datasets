To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PlanT: Explainable Planning Transformers via Object-Level Representations" by Katrin Renz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Longest6 benchmark for CARLA**, which indicates that a dataset is involved. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Longest6 benchmark**, which is a dataset collected with an expert policy for evaluating driving performance. The authors specify that this dataset contains **228k frames** and is used as a reference point for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Longest6 benchmark. The citation is as follows:
> K. Chitta, A. Prakash, B. Jaeger, Z. Yu, K. Renz, and A. Geiger. *Transfuser: Imitation with transformer-based sensor fusion for autonomous driving*. PAMI, 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Longest6 benchmark** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:
1. **Longest6 benchmark**: A dataset collected with an expert policy containing 228k frames for evaluating driving performance.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> K. Chitta, A. Prakash, B. Jaeger, Z. Yu, K. Renz, and A. Geiger. *Transfuser: Imitation with transformer-based sensor fusion for autonomous driving*. PAMI, 2022.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for further processing or review.
