To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Background Knowledge in Symbolic Regression Using a Computer Algebra System" by Charles Fox et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of symbolic regression to rediscover adsorption equations from experimental datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The authors explicitly state that they examined four experimental adsorption datasets. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Adsorption of nitrogen on mica**: This dataset is referenced in relation to the Langmuir isotherm model.
2. **Adsorption of methane on mica**: Similar to nitrogen, this dataset is also associated with the Langmuir model.
3. **Adsorption of isobutane in silicalite**: This dataset is described as being well-represented by a dual-site Langmuir model.
4. **Adsorption of nitrogen on Fe-Al203 catalyst**: This dataset is used to support the BET model for multilayer adsorption.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the original papers or sources of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Langmuir isotherm model** (which includes the nitrogen and methane datasets):
  > Irving Langmuir. *The Adsorption of Gases on Plane Surfaces of Glass, Mica and Platinum*. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 40(9):1361–1403, September 1918.

- For the **BET model** (which includes the nitrogen dataset on Fe-Al203 catalyst):
  > Stephen Brunauer, P. H. Emmett, and Edward Teller. *Adsorption of Gases in Multimolecular Layers*. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 60(2):309–319, February 1938.

- For the **isobutane dataset**:
  > T. J. H. Vlugt, W. Zhu, F. Kapteijn, J. A. Moulijn, B. Smit, and R. Krishna. *Adsorption of Linear and Branched Alkanes in the Zeolite Silicalite-1*. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 120(22):5599–5600, June 1998.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
