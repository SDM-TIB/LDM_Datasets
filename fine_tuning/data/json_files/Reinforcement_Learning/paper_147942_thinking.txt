To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Derivative-Free Global Optimization Algorithms: Population based Methods and Random Search Approaches" by Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss algorithms and experiments** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on optimization algorithms but does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** to see if the author references any datasets used in the context of optimization problems. The introduction discusses the need for optimization in deep learning but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology sections** (e.g., sections discussing Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, etc.) to see if any datasets are mentioned as benchmarks for evaluating the algorithms. However, the paper primarily focuses on algorithmic approaches and does not provide specific datasets used for experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant. The references include various papers on optimization algorithms, but they do not specifically list datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

- **No datasets were identified in the paper.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper's content to accurately extract relevant information.
