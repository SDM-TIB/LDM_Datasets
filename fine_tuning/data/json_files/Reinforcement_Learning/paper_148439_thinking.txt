To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mirror Descent Policy Optimization" by Manan Tomar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the authors typically discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors usually describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to reinforcement learning tasks, as the paper focuses on algorithms applied to continuous control tasks. I will also check for any references to established benchmarks or datasets commonly used in the reinforcement learning community.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to gather their full citations. This information is typically found in the **References section** of the paper. I will ensure to note down the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, I would look for the citation:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. Preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.

Finally, I will organize all the extracted information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
