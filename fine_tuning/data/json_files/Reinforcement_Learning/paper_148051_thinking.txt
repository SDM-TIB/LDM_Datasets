To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Implicit Human Preferences in Dialog" by Natasha Jaques et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the algorithms are tested on a problem of open-domain dialog generation, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems and the need for effective learning from human interaction data. This indicates that they likely used datasets related to human interactions.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention that they collected human responses to a set of over 40 different dialog models over several months, which implies that they have a dataset of human interactions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they built an interactive online platform to collect data from users interacting with their dialog models. They mention that they collected a batch of data containing **14,232 pairs of user input and agent response**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to two datasets used for training their dialog models:

1. **Movie Dialogs Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for training dialog systems and contains conversations from movies.
   - Citation:
     > Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Cristian, and Lillian Lee. "Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs." In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, pages 76â€“87. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

2. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset consists of conversations extracted from Reddit, which is often used for training conversational agents.
   - Citation:
     > Ghandeharioun, Asma, et al. "Approximating interactive human evaluation with self-play for open-domain dialog systems." arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.09308, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
