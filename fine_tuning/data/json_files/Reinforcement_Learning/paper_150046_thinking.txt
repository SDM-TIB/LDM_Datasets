To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Granger Causal Chain Discovery for Sepsis-Associated Derangements via Continuous-Time Hawkes Processes" by Song Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis. In this case, it mentions a dataset of patients admitted to the Grady hospital system in Atlanta, GA, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss data collection or datasets used. Here, the authors describe the patient cohort and the features collected from the electronic medical records (EMR). They mention that the data includes 37 patient features, which are vital signs and laboratory results, but they do not specify a formal dataset name.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the data or provide additional context about the datasets. For instance, Table 5 summarizes patient demographics, and Table 6 lists the Sepsis-Associated Derangements (SADs) and their corresponding measurements. However, these tables do not provide formal dataset citations.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The authors may reference previous studies or datasets that are foundational to their work. In this paper, while specific datasets are not cited in the traditional sense, the authors do refer to the Sepsis-3 criteria and other relevant studies that may have used similar datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided:

1. **Grady Hospital Patient Dataset**: This dataset includes patient data collected from the Grady hospital system in Atlanta, GA, focusing on patients who met Sepsis-3 criteria. The dataset comprises various features, including vital signs and laboratory results.

2. **Sepsis-Associated Derangements (SADs)**: The authors constructed SADs based on 37 patient features derived from the EMR data. While the specific dataset name is not provided, the features are detailed in Table 6.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to note that while specific dataset citations are not provided, the datasets are derived from the Grady hospital system and are based on established clinical criteria (Sepsis-3).

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

- **Grady Hospital Patient Dataset**: Patient data from the Grady hospital system, Atlanta, GA, focusing on Sepsis-3 criteria.
- **Sepsis-Associated Derangements (SADs)**: Constructed from 37 patient features, including vital signs and lab results.

Since formal citations are not available, I will note that the datasets are based on the authors' research and the clinical context provided in the paper.
