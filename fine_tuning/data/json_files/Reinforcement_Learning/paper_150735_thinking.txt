To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Models for Counterfactual Generation and Anomaly Detection in Brain Images" by Alessandro Fontanella et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Data), I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **IST-3 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a randomized-controlled trial that collected brain imaging data, primarily CT scans, from 3035 patients exhibiting stroke symptoms. The authors note that they considered a total of 5681 scans, with a breakdown of positive and negative classifications.

2. **BraTS2021 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge and consists of pre-operative baseline multi-parametric MRI scans from 1251 patients. The authors provide details about the number of slices and the preprocessing steps taken.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **IST-3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sandercock, P. A., Niewada, M., & CzÅ‚onkowska, A. (2011). The international stroke trial database. *Trials*, 12(1), 1-7.

- For the **BraTS2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Baid, U., Ghodasara, S., Mohan, S., Bilello, M., Calabrese, E., Colak, E., Farahani, K., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Kitamura, F. C., Pati, S., et al. (2021). The rsna-asnr-miccai brats 2021 benchmark on brain tumor segmentation and radiogenomic classification. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.02314*.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
