To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Class-Incremental Continual Learning with Adversarial Shapley Value" by Dongsub Shim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a variety of datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Split CIFAR-10**: This dataset is derived from the CIFAR-10 dataset and is split into 5 different tasks, each containing non-overlapping classes. The paper states that each task has 2 classes.

2. **Split CIFAR-100**: Similar to Split CIFAR-10, this dataset is constructed from the CIFAR-100 dataset and is divided into 10 disjoint tasks, with each task containing 10 classes.

3. **Split miniImageNet**: This dataset is created by splitting the miniImageNet dataset into 10 disjoint tasks, where each task contains 10 classes.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as the number of training, validation, and testing images per task, which can provide more context for each dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Tim Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29, 3630â€“3638, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future use or analysis.
