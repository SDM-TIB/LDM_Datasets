It is multipurpose, supporting various kinds of tasks, like detection, tracking, prediction, and segmentation. It provides 12 raw frames per second, but only 2 of them are aligned and can be used in our setting. We extract 556 minutes of valid video clips from it, and randomly split it into 80%/20% as the training set and validation set.",
