To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Start Team Orienteering Problem for UAS Mission Re-Planning with Data-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Dong Ho Lee and Jaemyung Ahn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem being addressed, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, it appears that the authors may have conducted experiments on classical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). I will check if they mention specific datasets or instances used for these experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or instances used. The authors may provide details about the number of instances, their characteristics, and how they were generated. If they mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to include the full citation as follows:

- For the **Gurobi Optimizer**, the citation is:
  > Gurobi Optimization. (2018). *Gurobi optimizer reference manual*. Retrieved from [Gurobi website](http://www.gurobi.com).

- If they reference a specific dataset used in the TSP or CVRP, I will find the corresponding citation in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
