To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-aware Goal Prediction and Conformant Model-based Planning for Safe Autonomous Driving" by Jonathan Francis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of expert demonstrations and mentions the **CARNOVEL benchmark**, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors evaluate their approach using the **CARLA simulator** and specifically mention three challenge benchmarks: **CARNOVEL**, **NoCrash**, and the **original CARLA benchmark**. This indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets used for evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CARNOVEL Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Filos, A., Tigkas, P., McAllister, R., Rhinehart, N., Levine, S., and Gal, Y. "Can autonomous vehicles identify, recover from, and adapt to distribution shifts?" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 3145–3153. PMLR, 2020.

2. **CARLA Simulator**: The citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., and Koltun, V. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1–16, 2017.

3. **NoCrash Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Codevilla, F., Müller, M., López, A., Koltun, V., and Dosovitskiy, A. "End-to-end driving via conditional imitation learning." In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 4693–4700. IEEE, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
