To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vanishing Bias Heuristic-guided Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" by Qinru Li and Hao Xiang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the implementation of various reinforcement learning methods in the lunar lander environment, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset or environment used for experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **technical approach section** (Section IV) to look for detailed descriptions of the game environment. The authors mention using the **Lunar Lander V2** developed by OpenAI, which is a specific environment rather than a traditional dataset. However, I need to confirm if there are any datasets or environments referenced in the experiments or results sections.

In the **experiments section (Section V)**, the authors describe their evaluation metrics and the setup for their experiments. They mention conducting experiments in the Lunar Lander environment, but they do not explicitly refer to any additional datasets beyond this environment.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Lunar Lander V2 environment, I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citation for this environment. The citation for the Lunar Lander V2 environment is:

- **Lunar Lander V2**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset/environment used in the paper. Since the primary focus is on the Lunar Lander V2 environment, I will create an entry for it, ensuring to include the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
