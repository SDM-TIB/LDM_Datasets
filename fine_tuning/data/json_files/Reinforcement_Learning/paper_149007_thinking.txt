To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Connecting Attributions and QA Model Behavior on Realistic Counterfactuals" by Xi Ye, Rohan Nair, and Greg Durrett, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention constructing counterfactual sets for three different reading comprehension (RC) settings. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. The authors describe their approach to evaluating model behavior using counterfactual examples, and they reference two specific datasets:

1. **HOTPOTQA**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on multi-hop question answering tasks. The authors mention it multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of their experiments.

2. **SQUAD**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset is another dataset referenced in the paper, specifically in the context of adversarial examples and model evaluation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For **HOTPOTQA**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Wang, Y., Yatskar, M., Ordonez, V., & Chang, K. W. (2018). HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **SQUAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
