To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curriculum goal masking for continuous deep reinforcement learning" by Manfred Eppe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of curriculum learning and its relevance to reinforcement learning, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach and any experimental setups.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely. Here, the authors detail their evaluation of the proposed curriculum goal masking (CGM) method using two robotic object manipulation tasks: the **push task** and the **pick-and-place task**. However, they do not specify any datasets used for these tasks, as they seem to be simulations rather than datasets derived from real-world data.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets relevant to the tasks discussed. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and robotics, but they do not directly point to specific datasets.

Given that the paper focuses on simulated tasks rather than real-world datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note the tasks and the context in which they were evaluated.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Push Task**: A robotic task where the robot must push an object to a random location on a table's surface.
2. **Pick-and-Place Task**: A robotic task where the robot must pick up an object and place it at a target position above the table.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned or cited, I will not provide any formal citations. Instead, I will summarize the tasks as they relate to the research conducted in the paper.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the research while adhering to the requirement of documenting datasets, even if none are formally presented.
