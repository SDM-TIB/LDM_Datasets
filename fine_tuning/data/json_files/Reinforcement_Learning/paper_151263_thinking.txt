To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Knowledge-Driven Meta-Learning for Task Offloading in Vehicular Networks with Integrated Communications, Sensing and Computing" by Ruijin Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which could include dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on" or "the following datasets were used."

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors describe how they collected or utilized the data, I will take note of that information as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors provide any additional context or performance metrics related to the datasets. This can help confirm the datasets' relevance to the study.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this specific paper, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: If a specific dataset is mentioned, I will note it down.
2. **Description**: I will provide a brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: I will ensure to include the complete citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively. After gathering all necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format for easy reference.
