To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dwelling Type Classification for Disaster Risk Assessment Using Satellite Imagery" by Md Nasir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that satellite imagery was used to identify different dwelling types, which suggests that a dataset related to satellite imagery is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (3.2) where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that high-quality satellite imagery was sourced from Maxar Technologies, specifically for the cities of Mumbai and Puri. This section provides critical information about the dataset, including the number of identified and labeled houses.

In the **overview of the dataset section** (3.3), the authors provide further details about the dataset, including the total number of identified structures and the final training dataset size after excluding certain categories. They also mention that the dataset consists of imagery from 8 areas of interest (4 from each city), which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on proprietary satellite imagery. However, I can cite the source of the imagery:

- For the satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, the citation is:
  > Maxar Technologies. *Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.maxar.com/

Additionally, I will note that the dataset includes labeled data for 14,000 houses, which is crucial for understanding its application in the research.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Dwelling Type Classification Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of satellite imagery used to identify and classify different dwelling types based on rooftop materials in low-income settlements in Mumbai and Puri, India. The dataset includes 14,000 labeled houses across 8 areas of interest.
   - **Citation**: Maxar Technologies. *Satellite Imagery*. [Online]. Available: https://www.maxar.com/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing or review.
