To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Recurrent Q-Learning vs Deep Q-Learning on a simple Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with Minecraft" by Clément Romac and Vincent Béraud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of Minecraft as a customizable environment for their experiments. They mention designing two simple missions but do not explicitly name any datasets yet. I will keep an eye out for any specific datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the parts where they describe the environments and tasks. The authors mention two specific environments: **Basic** and **Cliff Walking**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather tasks designed within the Minecraft environment.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the performance of their models on these environments. They do not reference any external datasets but rather describe the configurations and parameters of their experiments. 

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets or provide specific dataset names, I will conclude that the datasets in this context refer to the environments created within Minecraft rather than traditional datasets that can be cited.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the environments or tools used, such as Project Malmö or Gym-Minecraft. 

- For **Project Malmö**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, M., Hofmann, K., Hutton, T., & Bignell, D. (2016). The Malmo platform for artificial intelligence experimentation. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 4246–4247.

- For **Gym-Minecraft**, the citation is:
  > (No specific citation provided in the paper, but it can be referenced as the GitHub repository: https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft)

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather describes environments created for the experiments, I will summarize the findings accordingly.

In conclusion, I will note that the datasets in this paper are not traditional datasets but rather custom environments created in Minecraft for the purpose of the experiments. The relevant citations for the tools used are provided above.
