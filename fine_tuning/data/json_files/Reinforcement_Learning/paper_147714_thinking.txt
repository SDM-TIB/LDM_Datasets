To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Prediction Markets for Online Prediction of Continuous Variables - A Preliminary Report" by Fatemeh Jahedpari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of an **influenza-like illnesses (ILI) dataset** to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which indicates that a dataset is indeed utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments** section. The authors describe how they predict the level of ILI activity using various data sources, including Google Flu Trends and CDC statistics. This suggests that multiple datasets may be involved, so I need to identify each one clearly.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the data sources used for their predictions. They mention that the data includes over 100 real data streams covering the period from January 4, 2004, to April 27, 2014, from various sources. I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Google Flu Trends (GFT)**: This dataset includes weekly predictions for different areas in the United States, which is crucial for the study.
2. **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: The authors utilize CDC ILI rates for different age groups and the national ILI rate, which is another key dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **Google Flu Trends dataset**, the citation is:
> Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M. H., Patel, R. S., Brammer, L., Smolinski, M. S., & Brilliant, L. (2008). Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data. *Nature*, 457(7232), 1012-1014.

For the **CDC dataset**, the citation is:
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (n.d.). FluView: A weekly influenza surveillance report. Retrieved from http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
