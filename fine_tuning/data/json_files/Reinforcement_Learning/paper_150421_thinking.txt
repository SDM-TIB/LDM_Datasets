To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double A3C: Deep Reinforcement Learning on OpenAI Gym Games" by Yangxin Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors propose an improved version of the Double A3C algorithm to play OpenAI Gym Atari 2600 games. This indicates that the datasets used for training and evaluation may be related to these games.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, the authors state that they train and evaluate their approach using the environment of **OpenAI Gym Atari 2600 games**, specifically mentioning three games: **Breakout**, **Ice Hockey**, and **Pong**. This suggests that the datasets are the game environments provided by OpenAI Gym.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names beyond the games themselves, I will need to reference the OpenAI Gym as the source of these datasets. I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to OpenAI Gym or the specific games mentioned.

The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Additionally, I will note that the games themselves (Breakout, Ice Hockey, and Pong) are part of the Atari 2600 games collection, which is included in the OpenAI Gym framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **OpenAI Gym Atari 2600 Games**: This includes the games Breakout, Ice Hockey, and Pong, which are used for training and evaluation in the experiments.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
