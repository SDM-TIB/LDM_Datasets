To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Human-Level Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning" by Yuanpei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the development of the **Bimanual Dexterous Hands Benchmark (Bi-DexHands)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset or benchmark related to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation Benchmark)**, where the authors discuss the construction of datasets. Here, they mention that the benchmark utilizes objects from the **YCB dataset** and the **SAPIEN dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are integral to the experiments and evaluations conducted in the paper.

In **section 4.2 (Construction of Datasets)**, the authors elaborate on how the datasets are constructed, specifically highlighting the use of the YCB and SAPIEN datasets for various tasks. They describe the types of objects included in these datasets, which are essential for the bimanual manipulation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **YCB Dataset**:
   > Berk Calli, Arjun Singh, James Bruce, Aaron Walsman, Kurt Konolige, Siddhartha Srinivasa, Pieter Abbeel, and Aaron M. Dollar. *Yale-CMU-Berkeley Dataset for Robotic Manipulation Research*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(3):261–268, 2017.

2. **SAPIEN Dataset**:
   > Fanbo Xiang, Yuzhe Qin, Kaichun Mo, Yikuan Xia, Hao Zhu, Fangchen Liu, Minghua Liu, Hanxiao Jiang, Yifu Yuan, He Wang, et al. *Sapien: A Simulated Part-Based Interactive Environment*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11097–11107, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field of reinforcement learning and robotic manipulation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
