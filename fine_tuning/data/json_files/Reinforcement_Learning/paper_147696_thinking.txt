To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State of the Art Control of Atari Games Using Shallow Reinforcement Learning" by Yitao Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset or framework used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **background section** to understand the context of the ALE. The authors mention that the ALE is composed of dozens of Atari 2600 games, which indicates that the dataset consists of various games rather than a single dataset. This is important for my documentation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of the games used in their experiments. The authors refer to multiple Atari games, but I need to identify which specific games were used for evaluation and if they provide any additional details about the datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find citations for the ALE and any other datasets mentioned. The ALE is referenced in the paper, and I will need to ensure I have the correct citation for it.

The key datasets identified in this paper are:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is the primary dataset used for evaluating the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithms. It consists of various Atari 2600 games, which serve as the testbed for the experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the ALE. The relevant citation is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
