To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-Efficient Automated Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jörg K.H. Franke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method on the **MuJoCo benchmark suite**, which suggests that this is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 4)**, where the authors detail their experiments with the **TD3 algorithm** in the **MuJoCo environments**. Here, they mention specific environments such as **HalfCheetah, Walker2D, Ant, Hopper, and Reacher**. These are likely the datasets or environments they utilized for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the environments used for evaluation. I will note down each environment as a dataset:

1. **MuJoCo HalfCheetah**: A continuous control environment for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **MuJoCo Walker2D**: Another continuous control environment designed for testing RL algorithms.
3. **MuJoCo Ant**: A more complex environment that challenges RL algorithms with a quadrupedal robot.
4. **MuJoCo Hopper**: A simpler environment focused on a one-legged robot.
5. **MuJoCo Reacher**: A task involving reaching a target with a robotic arm.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the MuJoCo environments. The original paper describing the MuJoCo physics engine is:

- For **MuJoCo**:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026–5033.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
