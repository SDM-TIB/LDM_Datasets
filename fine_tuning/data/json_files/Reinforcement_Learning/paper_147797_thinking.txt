To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Perturbed Rewards" by Jingkang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on various reinforcement learning platforms, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on **OpenAI Gym** environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments are used.

I will then check the **experimental setup** section to identify specific environments and tasks used in the experiments. The paper mentions testing on two classic control games (CartPole and Pendulum) and seven Atari 2600 games (AirRaid, Alien, Carnival, MsPacman, Pong, Phoenix, Seaquest). Each of these games can be considered a dataset in the context of reinforcement learning.

Now, I will compile the information about these datasets:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes various environments, including the classic control tasks and Atari games mentioned.

2. **CartPole**: A classic control task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The dataset consists of state-action-reward sequences generated during the training of the RL agent.

3. **Pendulum**: Another classic control task where the goal is to keep a pendulum upright. Similar to CartPole, the dataset consists of state-action-reward sequences.

4. **Atari 2600 Games**: The paper mentions seven specific games, each providing a unique environment for training RL agents. The datasets for these games consist of frames (images) and associated rewards as the agent interacts with the game.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The OpenAI Gym is widely recognized, and its citation is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. 

For the specific games, they are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, so they do not have separate citations. However, I will note that the environments are based on classic reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified along with their citations, ensuring that I have documented everything clearly and accurately for future reference or processing.
