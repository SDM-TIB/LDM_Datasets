To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised ASR via Cross-Lingual Pseudo-Labeling" by Tatiana Likhomanenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **Common Voice**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup (Section 4)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Common Voice** dataset (version v12.0) for their experiments. They also mention using **LJSpeech** and **LibriSpeech** datasets for comparison purposes. 

In the **background and methodology sections**, I will check for any additional datasets that might be referenced indirectly or used in their experiments. However, the primary datasets mentioned are already clear.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Common Voice**:
   > Rosana Ardila et al. "Common Voice: A Massively-Multilingual Speech Corpus." In LREC, 2020.

2. **LJSpeech**:
   > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. "The LJ Speech Dataset." 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

3. **LibriSpeech**:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. "LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books." In ICASSP, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
