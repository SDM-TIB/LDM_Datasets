To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resource Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Abhinav Bhatia, Pradeep Varakantham, and Akshat Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their methods on simulators validated on semi-real and real datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention two specific simulators used for their experiments: 

1. **Emergency Response Simulator**: This simulator is based on the work of Yue, Marla, and Krishnan (2012) and uses demand patterns inspired by actual statistics from Singapore in 2011. This suggests that there is a dataset related to emergency response demand patterns.

2. **Bike Sharing Simulator**: This simulator is based on the work of Ghosh and Varakantham (2017) and utilizes a modified real demand dataset for 60 weekdays. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for bike sharing.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Emergency Response Simulator**, the relevant citation is:
  > Yue, Y., Marla, L., and Krishnan, R. (2012). An efficient simulation-based approach to ambulance fleet allocation and dynamic redeployment. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 398â€“405.

- For the **Bike Sharing Simulator**, the citation is:
  > Ghosh, S., and Varakantham, P. (2017). Incentivizing the use of bike trailers for dynamic repositioning in bike sharing systems. 

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Emergency Response Dataset**: Derived from the simulator inspired by actual demand statistics in Singapore (Yue et al., 2012).
2. **Bike Sharing Dataset**: A modified real demand dataset for 60 weekdays used in the bike sharing simulator (Ghosh and Varakantham, 2017).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
