To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep reinforcement learning for feedback control in a collective flashing ratchet" by Dong-Kyum Kim and Hawoong Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context and relevance of their work. This section may reference previous studies or datasets that are foundational to their research.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or testing the models. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets utilized. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets. This can provide confirmation of the datasets used and their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
