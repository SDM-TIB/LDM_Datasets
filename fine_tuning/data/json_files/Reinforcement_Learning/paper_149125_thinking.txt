To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Empowerment as Representation Learning for Goal-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Jongwook Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to environments or benchmarks used in the experiments. For example, the authors might mention specific environments from the OpenAI Gym or other standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **MuJoCo control suite**, I will look for the citation in the references:
- Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

If they mention using specific datasets like **HalfCheetah**, **Ant**, or **Humanoid**, I will ensure to note that these are part of the MuJoCo suite and cite accordingly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly, making it easy for others to understand the datasets' relevance and how they were applied in the context of the research.
