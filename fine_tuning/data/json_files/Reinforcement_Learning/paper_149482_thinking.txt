To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning-based fast solver of the shallow water equations" by Mojtaba Forghani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the estimation of river flow velocities and mentions a two-stage process involving the estimation of bathymetry from flow velocity measurements, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of accurately estimating flow velocities and mention the use of the shallow water equations (SWEs) but do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods** section, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or validation. The authors describe the use of synthetic flow velocity measurements generated via a numerical solver called Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) but do not provide a specific dataset name.

In the **data preparation** section, the authors mention that they applied the principal component geostatistical approach (PCGA) to flow velocity observations taken from the Savannah River, Augusta, GA. This indicates that the flow velocity measurements are part of a dataset, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

In the **performance evaluation** section, the authors mention using a total of 4,000 river profiles for training, 500 for validation, and 450 for testing. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that may have been cited indirectly. The references include various studies related to hydraulic modeling and flow velocity estimation, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset that the authors used.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors describe the data preparation and the number of profiles used, they do not provide specific dataset names or formal citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset referenced is the synthetic flow velocity measurements generated from the AdH solver, but it lacks a formal citation.

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Flow Velocity Measurements**: Generated from the AdH solver, used for training and validation of the models. However, no formal dataset name or citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings without creating structured entries, as there are no formal datasets to cite.
