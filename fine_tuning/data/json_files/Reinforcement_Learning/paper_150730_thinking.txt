To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Caching-at-STARS: the Next Generation Edge" by Zhaoming Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check there as well, as authors often discuss the datasets in the context of their findings, which may provide additional insights into the datasets' relevance and application.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the details provided in the paper and search for the original source online.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clearly formatted and ready for presentation or further processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
