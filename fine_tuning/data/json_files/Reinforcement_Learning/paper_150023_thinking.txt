To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Go-Explore Complex 3D Game Environments for Automated Reachability Testing" by Cong Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a powerful exploration algorithm, Go-Explore, but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of testing large game maps, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**, where the authors describe their experiments on three proprietary test game levels designed in Unreal Engine 5. The paper lists these maps as:

1. **Small Map**: A small test bed with obstacles and two intentionally placed bugs (approx. 100m x 100m).
2. **Large Map**: A vast cityscape to test the scalability of each algorithm (approx. 1.5km x 1.5km).
3. **Traversal Map**: A large multi-level map with challenging geometry as a hard exploration challenge.

These maps are critical for the experiments, but they are proprietary and do not have publicly available citations.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited that are relevant to the experiments. However, the references primarily discuss prior work and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the proprietary datasets used (the game levels), I will note that while the authors conducted experiments on these maps, they do not provide external citations for them. This is common in research involving proprietary data.

In summary, I will document the following datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Small Map**: Proprietary test map (no citation available).
2. **Large Map**: Proprietary test map (no citation available).
3. **Traversal Map**: Proprietary test map (no citation available).

Since these datasets are proprietary and do not have formal citations, I will indicate that they are not publicly available for reference.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
