To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QSMVM: QoS-aware and social-aware multimetric routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs" by Efra√≠n Palacios Jara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a routing protocol for video-streaming services over MANETs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to identify if any datasets are cited in the context of previous research. This section may provide insights into datasets used in similar studies, even if they are not directly used in this paper.

Then, I will look into the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. If the authors conducted simulations, they might have used synthetic datasets or real-world datasets, which should be clearly stated.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors may summarize their findings and mention any datasets that were particularly significant to their results. 

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Clearly state the name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size, type, and the context in which it was used.
3. **Full Citation**: Include the complete citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Bonnmotion" for generating mobility scenarios, I would note it down as follows:

- **Bonnmotion**: A tool to generate mobility scenarios for mobile ad hoc networks.
- **Full Citation**: Bonnmotion: Tool to generate mobility scenarios for mobile ad hoc networks. http://sys.cs.uos.de/bonnmotion/.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This process ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
