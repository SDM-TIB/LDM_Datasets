To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixtures of Laplace Approximations for Improved Post-Hoc Uncertainty in Deep Learning" by Runa Eschenhagen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on multiple image classification benchmarks, specifically referring to datasets such as **rotated MNIST**, **corrupted CIFAR-10**, and **corrupted ImageNet**. These are key indicators that datasets are being utilized.

I will then look for any **specific details** about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test). For instance, the paper mentions that the **rotated MNIST** dataset consists of transformed MNIST images rotated by various angles, while the **corrupted CIFAR-10** and **corrupted ImageNet** datasets consist of standard datasets with added corruption types.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
