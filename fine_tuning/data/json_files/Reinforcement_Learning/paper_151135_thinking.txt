To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-enabled Priority and Auction-Based Spectrum Management for 6G" by Mina Khadem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and background, which might hint at datasets used in previous studies or those relevant to the current research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize data or results, as they often reference specific datasets.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention simulation parameters in **Table II**, which outlines various parameters for their experiments. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous work or methodologies.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works that may have used datasets relevant to their study. For instance, they reference works that discuss spectrum management and resource allocation, which may imply the use of datasets from those studies.

I will compile the relevant citations for any datasets mentioned in the references. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include the full citation for those datasets as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that they are accurate and complete, ready for any downstream processing or analysis.
