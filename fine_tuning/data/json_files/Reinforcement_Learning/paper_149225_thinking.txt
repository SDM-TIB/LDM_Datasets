To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying machine learning-induced overdiagnosis in sepsis" by Anna Fedyukova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a specific dataset, **MIMIC-IV**, which is a strong indication that it is a primary dataset for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They explicitly state that they used the **MIMIC-IV database**, which contains de-identified clinical data from patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2019. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its scope and the criteria for patient inclusion.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the data collected from the MIMIC-IV dataset, confirming its role in their analysis. There are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, which simplifies the extraction process.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-IV dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **MIMIC-IV**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. C., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M. M., ... & Mark, R. G. (2020). MIMIC-IV: A freely accessible electronic health record dataset. *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 1-13. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0057-8

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research paper and its full citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
