To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Actors and Learners: A Framework for Generating Scalable RL Implementations" by Chi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework's effectiveness in accelerating reinforcement learning algorithms using OpenAI benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using OpenAI benchmarks, which typically include several standard datasets for reinforcement learning tasks. I will need to identify the specific datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors reference the use of the **LunarLander-v2** environment, which is part of the OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the dataset for this environment is implicitly included in the framework's evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The relevant citation for the LunarLander-v2 environment is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. Retrieved from https://gym.openai.com/

Since the paper does not explicitly mention additional datasets beyond the OpenAI benchmarks, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the one associated with the LunarLander-v2 environment.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym environment, which serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted in this paper.
