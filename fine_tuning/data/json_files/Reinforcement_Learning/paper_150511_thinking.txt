To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Matters: The Game of Chess Poses a Challenge to Vision Transformers" by Johannes Czech et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using transformers in chess but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and experiments sections** where datasets are more likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Representation Matters)**, the authors mention using the **KingBase Lite 2019 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is described as a free chess database containing over 1 million chess games played by human expert players with a player ELO rating greater than 2200. This is a significant dataset for their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KingBase Lite 2019 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> KingBase Lite 2019. Available at: https://archive.org/details/KingBaseLite2019, accessed 2022-11-02.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **KingBase Lite 2019**: A chess database containing over 1 million games played by expert players.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> KingBase Lite 2019. Available at: https://archive.org/details/KingBaseLite2019, accessed 2022-11-02.

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information and its citation from the research paper.
