To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature-based Learning for Diverse and Privacy-Preserving Counterfactual Explanations" by Vy Vo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world datasets," which indicates that there are datasets utilized in the research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes information about customers taking credit at a bank, with the task of classifying customers as good or bad credit risks.

2. **Adult Income Dataset**: Extracted from the US 1994 census data, this dataset is used to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year.

3. **Graduate Admission Dataset**: This dataset contains data on Indian students' applications to a Master's program, with the task of predicting admission chances.

4. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset records the performance of students at two schools, predicting whether a student achieves a final score above average.

I will then check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **German Credit Dataset**:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- For the **Graduate Admission Dataset**:
  > Acharya, M. S., Armaan, A., & Antony, A. S. (2019). A comparison of regression models for prediction of graduate admissions. In 2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science (ICCIDS). IEEE, 1â€“5.

- For the **Student Performance Dataset**:
  > Cortez, P., & Silva, A. G. (2008). Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance. (2008).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
