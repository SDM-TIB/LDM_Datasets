To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Detection of Label Errors in Semantic Segmentation Datasets via Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification" by Matthias Rottmann and Marco Reese, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a method for detecting label errors in semantic segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Benchmarks for Label Error Detection in Semantic Segmentation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is described as a high-quality dataset for semantic urban scene understanding, which contains high-resolution images annotated with pixel-wise labels. The authors use this dataset to benchmark their label error detection method.

2. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the CARLA driving simulator, which provides a controlled environment for creating segmentation masks. The authors mention that they have the ground truth under control in this dataset, allowing them to create synthetic label errors for evaluation.

In addition to these primary datasets, the authors also refer to other datasets in their experiments, specifically:

- **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: A well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks.
- **COCO-Stuff Dataset**: A dataset that includes both thing and stuff classes for semantic segmentation.
- **ADE20K Dataset**: A dataset that contains a diverse set of scenes annotated with pixel-wise labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
