To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Healthcare with EOG: A Novel Approach to Sleep Stage Classification" by Suvadeep Maiti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors reference "publically available databases (SleepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS)" which indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The authors mention that their model is tested on multiple publicly available datasets, specifically naming **SleepEDF-20**, **SleepEDF-78**, and **SHHS**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a detailed description of each dataset. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **SleepEDF-20**: This dataset consists of 39 PSG records from 20 healthy individuals aged 25-34, with manual sleep stage classification based on the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) standard criteria.

2. **SleepEDF-78**: An expanded version of SleepEDF-20, this dataset includes PSG recordings from 78 participants.

3. **SHHS (Sleep Heart Health Study)**: This dataset comprises 6,441 subjects, each with a single full-night PSG recording.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
