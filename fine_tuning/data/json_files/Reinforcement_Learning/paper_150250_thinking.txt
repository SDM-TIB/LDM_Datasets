To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post Hoc Explanations May Be Ineffective for Detecting Unknown Spurious Correlation" by Julius Adebayo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **semi-synthetic datasets** to evaluate the effectiveness of post hoc model explanations, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using three classes of datasets for their experiments, specifically for two medical tasks and a dog species classification task. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

In the **section discussing the datasets**, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **Bone Age Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge conducted by the Radiological Society of North America in 2017. It consists of 12,282 training samples, 1,425 validation samples, and 200 test samples.

2. **Knee Radiographs Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the open-source release by Chen et al. (2019) and consists of 5,778 training samples, 826 validation samples, and 1,656 test samples.

3. **Dog Breed Classification Dataset**: This dataset is a combination of the Stanford Dogs dataset and the Oxford Cats and Dogs datasets, focusing on 10 dog classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Bone Age Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Knee Radiographs Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Dog Breed Classification Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
