To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Terminal Prediction as an Auxiliary Task for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Bilal Kartal, Pablo Hernandez-Leal, and Matthew E. Taylor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the domains used for evaluation. They mention conducting experiments on **Atari games**, **BipedalWalker**, and **Pommerman**. I will look for specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these domains.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify the following:

1. **Atari Games**: They mention using a selection of six Atari games, specifically **Pong, Breakout, CrazyClimber, Q*bert, BeamRider, and SpaceInvaders**. These games are part of the OpenAI Gym environment, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning.

2. **BipedalWalker**: This is another environment used for evaluation, which is also available through OpenAI Gym.

3. **Pommerman**: The authors refer to the Pommerman environment, which is based on the classic Bomberman game and is a multi-agent environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Pommerman**, the citation is:
  > Resnick, C., Eldridge, W., Ha, D., Britz, D., Foerster, J., Togelius, J., Cho, K., & Bruna, J. (2018). Pommerman: A multi-agent playground. AIIDE Multi-Agent Workshop.

- For **BipedalWalker**, since it is part of OpenAI Gym, it does not have a separate citation but is included in the OpenAI Gym reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

1. **Atari Games** (Pong, Breakout, CrazyClimber, Q*bert, BeamRider, SpaceInvaders):
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **BipedalWalker**:
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

3. **Pommerman**:
   - Citation: Resnick, C., Eldridge, W., Ha, D., Britz, D., Foerster, J., Togelius, J., Cho, K., & Bruna, J. (2018). Pommerman: A multi-agent playground. AIIDE Multi-Agent Workshop.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
