To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the impact of low-rank adaptation on the performance, efficiency, and regularization of RLHF" by Simeng Sun, Dhawal Gupta, and Mohit Iyyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Alpaca dataset** for aligning the LLaMA 7B checkpoint, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 2 (Implementing RLHF with LoRA)** and **section 2.1 (Experimental settings)**. Here, the authors describe the **Alpaca-52K instruction-following dataset**, which is automatically generated and contains diverse tasks. This dataset is crucial for understanding the experiments conducted in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used the **Alpaca-52K dataset** for supervised fine-tuning and provide details about the splits used for different stages of RLHF. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Alpaca dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. 2023. Available at: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca.

- The **AlpacaFarm** framework is cited as:
  > Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Rohan Taori, Tianyi Zhang, Ishaan Gulrajani, Jimmy Ba, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Alpacafarm: A simulation framework for methods that learn from human feedback*. 2023. Available at: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_farm.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
