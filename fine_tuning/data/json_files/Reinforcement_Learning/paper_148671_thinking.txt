To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Student-Initiated Action Advising via Advice Novelty" by Ercument Ilhan, Jeremy Gow, and Diego Perez-Liebana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted in **GridWorld** and **MinAtar**, indicating that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine **section IV (The Game Environments)**, where the authors describe the two environments in detail:

1. **GridWorld**: This is a grid-structured environment where an agent navigates to a goal tile while avoiding obstacles. The paper mentions that the code for this environment is available at a specific GitHub repository, which is useful for citation purposes.

2. **MinAtar**: This environment consists of minimal versions of five popular Atari games. The authors provide a brief description of each game, including **Asterix**, **Breakout**, **Freeway**, **Seaquest**, and **Space Invaders**. Each game has a common action space and specific observation sizes.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors confirm that they used both **GridWorld** and **MinAtar** for their experiments, which solidifies their role as datasets in this research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For **GridWorld**, the citation is:
  > Ercument Ilhan, Jeremy Gow, and Diego Perez-Liebana. *Action advising with advice imitation in deep reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, AAMAS 2021, May 3-7, 2021, (To appear), IFAAMAS, 2021. Available at: https://github.com/ercumentilhan/GridWorld

- For **MinAtar**, the citation is:
  > K. Young and T. Tian. *Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for more efficient reinforcement learning experiments*. CoRR, vol. abs/1903.03176, 2019. Available at: https://github.com/ercumentilhan/MinAtar/tree/original

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
