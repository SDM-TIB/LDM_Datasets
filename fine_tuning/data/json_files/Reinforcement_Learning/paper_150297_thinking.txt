To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining ELH Concept Descriptions through Counterfactual Reasoning" by Leonie Nora Sieger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and relevance of the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using modified versions of the Family and Animals ontologies for their user survey. This indicates that these ontologies are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 2**, which outlines the datasets used for the user survey, including the number of instances, axioms, atomic concepts, and roles.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Family Ontology**: This dataset is used to classify family members and contains 202 instances, 2,033 axioms, 18 atomic concepts, and 5 roles.

2. **Animals Ontology**: This dataset is used to classify species of animals and contains 28 instances, 170 axioms, 19 atomic concepts, and 4 roles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are ontologies and not traditional datasets with specific publications, I will cite the relevant papers or sources that describe these ontologies:

- For the **Family Ontology**, the citation is:
  > The Family Ontology. (n.d.). Retrieved from [source or repository link if available].

- For the **Animals Ontology**, the citation is:
  > The Animals Ontology. (n.d.). Retrieved from [source or repository link if available].

If specific publications or repositories are not provided in the paper, I will note that these ontologies are commonly used in the field and may be found in various knowledge base repositories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference.
