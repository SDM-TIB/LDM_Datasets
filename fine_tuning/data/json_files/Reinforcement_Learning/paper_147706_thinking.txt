To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Angrier Birds: Bayesian reinforcement learning" by Imanol Arrieta Ibarra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses training a reinforcement learner to play a simplified version of Angry Birds, but it does not mention any datasets directly. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction describes the game and the simulation setup but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. The paper describes the algorithms and feature extractors but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

In the **results and discussion section**, I will check if the authors refer to any datasets used for comparison or evaluation of their algorithms. However, the results primarily focus on the performance of the algorithms rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references include various papers and a GitHub repository for the Angry Birds simulation, but they do not provide specific datasets used in the experiments.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned that require citation. The authors utilized a custom simulation of Angry Birds, which they adapted from an open-source project, but they did not reference any external datasets.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create for this research paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have ensured to retrieve full citations for each dataset from the references section and document them accordingly.
