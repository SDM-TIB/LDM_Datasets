To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIRROR: Differentiable Deep Social Projection for Assistive Human-Robot Communication" by Kaiqi Chen, Jeffrey Fong, and Harold Soh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may reference datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe experiments conducted in three simulated domains: **Gridworld Driving**, **Search & Rescue**, and **Bomb Defusal**. Each of these domains likely involves specific datasets or simulated environments that are crucial for the experiments.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors mention that they created simulated human agents using data collected from real human participants. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from human interactions in the driving task, which is essential for training the simulated agents.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details regarding the datasets, including how they were collected and any specific characteristics or parameters associated with them.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **Gridworld Driving Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from human participants driving a car in a simulated environment. The dataset includes various scenarios with different car movements and visibility conditions (clear weather vs. dense fog).

2. **Search & Rescue Dataset**: This dataset is derived from human interactions in a simulated search-and-rescue task, where participants had to locate and rescue a victim. The dataset includes observations of the environment and actions taken by the participants.

3. **Bomb Defusal Dataset**: This dataset involves data collected from human participants tasked with defusing a bomb using a teleoperated robot. The dataset includes information about the bomb type, terminal positions, and participant actions.

Next, I will look for full citations for any datasets mentioned in the references section of the paper. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
