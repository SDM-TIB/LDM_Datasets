To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid thermal modeling of additive manufacturing processes using physics-informed neural networks for temperature prediction and parameter identification" by Shuheng Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of "partially observed temperature data measured from an infrared camera," which indicates that experimental data is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to the need for both simulation data and experimental data, suggesting that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup or data collection. The authors mention using a "coaxial IR camera" to monitor the melt pool temperature, which implies that they have collected temperature data during their experiments. I will look for details about the dataset, such as the number of data points, the conditions under which the data was collected, and any preprocessing steps.

In the **results section**, I will check for any quantitative results that reference specific datasets. The authors mention using "synthetic IR images generated from the FEM simulation results," which indicates that they also utilized simulation data alongside experimental data.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several studies that may provide context or original sources for the datasets used. 

1. For the **temperature data from the coaxial IR camera**, I will cite the relevant reference that discusses the use of IR cameras in additive manufacturing:
   > Hu D, Kovacevic R (2003) Sensing, modeling and control for laser-based additive manufacturing. *Int J Mach Tools Manuf* 43(1):51â€“60.

2. For the **FEM simulation data**, I will look for the original source of the simulation methodology or results that the authors refer to in their work. This may involve tracing back through the references to find the foundational studies that describe the FEM simulations used to generate the synthetic data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for each source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
