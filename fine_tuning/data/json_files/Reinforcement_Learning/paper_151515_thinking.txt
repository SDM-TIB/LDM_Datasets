To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the Category of Verbal Aspect in Transformer Language Models" by Anisia Katinskaia and Roman Yangarber, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions probing experiments using BERT and RoBERTa, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of prior studies on how aspect is encoded in pretrained language models, which indicates that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their probing experiments. Here, they mention two main sources:

1. **ReLCo corpus**: This corpus is used for alternative contexts and contains exercises for learners of Russian, where verb forms differ only by the aspect feature. The authors reference their own previous work for this dataset.
   
2. **Omnia corpus**: This corpus is used for non-alternative contexts, from which sentences were randomly selected to create a dataset for probing.

The authors also mention that they created a new dataset, the **Russian Aspect Bank**, which includes over 2,000 unique aspect pairs, manually annotated in collaboration with experts in Russian linguistics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ReLCo corpus**, the citation is:
  > Anisia Katinskaia, Maria Lebedeva, Jue Hou, and Roman Yangarber. *Semi-automatically annotated learner corpus for Russian*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 832–839, Marseille, France, 2022. European Language Resources Association.

- For the **Omnia corpus**, the citation is:
  > Tatiana Olegovna Shavrina and Vladimír Benko. *Omnia russica: even larger Russian corpus*. In Corpus Linguistics-2019, pages 94–102, 2019.

- For the **Russian Aspect Bank**, the citation is:
  > Anisia Katinskaia, Roman Yangarber. *The first Russian Aspect Bank with over 2K unique aspect pairs*. 2023. (This is a general reference as the specific citation format is not provided in the paper).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
