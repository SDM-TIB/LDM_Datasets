To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?" by Maksym Andriushchenko and Nicolas Flammarion, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various models, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using **100 harmful behaviors from JBB-Behaviors** as a dataset for their evaluations. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **results section**, the authors present quantitative results based on the evaluations conducted on the models, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they refer back to the JBB-Behaviors dataset for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the JBB-Behaviors dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Patrick Chao, Alexander Robey, Edgar Dobriban, Hamed Hassani, George J Pappas, and Eric Wong. *Jailbreakbench: An open robustness benchmark for jailbreaking large language models*. In NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2024.

Since JBB-Behaviors is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
