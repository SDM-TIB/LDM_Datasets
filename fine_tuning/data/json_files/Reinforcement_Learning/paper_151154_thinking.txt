To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Edits for Counterfactual Explanations: A Comparative Study" by Angeliki Dimitriou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "graph edits" and "counterfactual explanations," which suggests that datasets related to these concepts may be present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of explainability in neural models and mention the use of "scene graphs." This indicates that the datasets might involve visual data represented as graphs.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly where they describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Visual Genome (VG)** dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They state that VG contains real-life scenes with manually annotated scene graphs, making it a significant dataset for their research.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, they detail their use of the Visual Genome dataset and describe two specific splits of this dataset: **VG-DENSE** and **VG-RANDOM**. They explain that VG-DENSE includes graphs with many interconnections, while VG-RANDOM does not impose restrictions on scene graph density. Both splits contain 500 graphs, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Visual Genome dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A., et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 32â€“73, 2017.

With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the method section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Identify the Visual Genome dataset and its splits (VG-DENSE and VG-RANDOM).
4. Retrieve the full citation for the Visual Genome dataset from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
