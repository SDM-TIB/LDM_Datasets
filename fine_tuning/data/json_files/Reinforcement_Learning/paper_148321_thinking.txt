To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimistic Exploration Even with a Pessimistic Initialization" by Tabish Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed algorithm and its performance but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context on the experiments conducted, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for any specific names of datasets or environments that the authors used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention three environments used for their experiments:
1. **Randomized Chain**: A randomized version of a chain environment used to evaluate the algorithm's performance.
2. **Maze**: A two-dimensional gridworld maze where the agent must find a goal.
3. **Montezuma’s Revenge**: A classic Atari game known for its sparse rewards, which is often used as a benchmark in reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are not traditional datasets but rather simulation environments, I will note them as such.

The citations for the environments are as follows:
- For **Randomized Chain**, the reference is:
  > Osband, I., et al. (2016). *Model-based active exploration*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For **Maze**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning literature.

- For **Montezuma’s Revenge**, the reference is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the environments and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Randomized Chain**: 
   - Citation: Osband, I., et al. (2016). *Model-based active exploration*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning.

2. **Maze**: 
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature.

3. **Montezuma’s Revenge**: 
   - Citation: Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
