To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Parametric Stochastic Policy Gradient with Strategic Retreat for Non-Stationary Environment" by Apan Dastider and Mingjie Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. If any datasets are mentioned, I will note their names and any details provided.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive information about the datasets used in the study. I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Panda-Gym" in the experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Q. Gallouédec, N. Cazin, E. Dellandrèa, and L. Chen. *Panda-Gym: Open-Source Goal-Conditioned Environments for Robotic Learning*. 4th Robot Learning Workshop: Self-Supervised and Lifelong Learning at NeurIPS, 2021.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
