To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Coded Computation for Mobile Ad Hoc Computing" by Baoqian Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel coded computation scheme and mentions "comprehensive simulation studies," which suggests that datasets may be involved in these simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or simulation studies section**. In this paper, the authors describe a MAHC system formed by multiple UAVs and conduct simulation studies to evaluate their proposed algorithm. I will pay close attention to any datasets used for these simulations.

Upon reviewing the **simulation settings**, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the environment and parameters for their simulations, such as the number of UAVs, their computing powers, and communication models. This indicates that the authors likely created synthetic datasets for their experiments rather than using established datasets.

Since there are no specific datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors reference their previous studies for certain methodologies (e.g., batch processing procedures). However, these references do not constitute datasets themselves.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant citations for methodologies or frameworks referenced in the paper, even if they do not pertain to specific datasets.

In conclusion, while this paper does not provide explicit datasets, it discusses simulation parameters and methodologies that could be relevant for future research. I will summarize these findings and note the absence of publicly available datasets in my final output.
