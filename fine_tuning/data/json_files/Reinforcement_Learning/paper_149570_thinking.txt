To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reproducible, incremental representation learning with Rosetta VAE" by Miles Martinez and John Pearson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets of varying complexity in section A (Datasets):

1. **8 Gaussians**: A toy dataset comprising 8 Gaussians in two dimensions.
2. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, referenced from LeCun et al. (2010).
3. **3D Chairs**: A dataset used for 3D object recognition, referenced from Aubry et al. (2014).
4. **Birdsong**: A dataset of zebra finch birdsong spectrograms, referenced from Goffinet et al. (2021).

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *Mnist handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2, 2010.

- For **3D Chairs**, the citation is:
  > Mathieu Aubry, Daniel Maturana, Alexei Efros, Bryan Russell, and Josef Sivic. *Seeing 3D chairs: exemplar part-based 2D-3D alignment using a large dataset of CAD models*. In CVPR, 2014.

- For **Birdsong**, the citation is:
  > Jack Goffinet, Samuel Brudner, Richard Mooney, and John Pearson. *Low-dimensional learned feature spaces quantify individual and group differences in vocal repertoires*. eLife, 10, May 2021. doi: 10.7554/elife.67855. URL https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.67855.

The **8 Gaussians** dataset is a synthetic dataset and does not have a formal citation since it is commonly used in the literature.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, ready for further processing or review.
