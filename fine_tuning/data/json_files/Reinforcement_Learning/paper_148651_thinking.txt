To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast semantic parsing with well-typedness guarantees" by Matthias Lindemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of their parsing algorithms but does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context on the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their models. Here, they mention evaluating their methods on several graphbanks, specifically:

1. **DM (Deep Meaning)**: This dataset is used for semantic dependency parsing.
2. **PAS (Proposition Argument Structure)**: Another dataset for evaluating semantic parsing.
3. **PSD (Propositional Semantic Dependency)**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of their evaluation.
4. **EDS (Enhanced Dependency Structure)**: This dataset is used for semantic parsing tasks.
5. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: The authors refer to multiple releases of this dataset, specifically LDC2015E86, LDC2017T10, and LDC2020T02.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DM**:

- For **PAS**:

- For **PSD**:

- For **AMR**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their full citations.
