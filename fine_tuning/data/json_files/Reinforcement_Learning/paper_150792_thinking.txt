To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaZero Gomoku" by Wen Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of AlphaZero to the game of Gomoku, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on reinforcement learning and the challenges of Gomoku, but again, no datasets are referenced directly.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if any datasets are described in the context of the experiments conducted. In section 2.3, the authors mention that they created a specially-designed Gomoku gaming environment and implemented a 6x6 board for their experiments. However, they do not refer to any external datasets; instead, they describe their own implementation and the game mechanics.

Since there are no external datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **experiments and results sections** to confirm this. The results section discusses the performance of the AlphaZero methodology but does not reference any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to ensure that I have not missed any citations related to datasets. However, the references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and previous studies on AlphaZero and Gomoku, rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not utilize any external datasets for its experiments; instead, it focuses on the development of a new algorithm applied to a game environment they created. Therefore, there are no datasets to extract or cite from this paper.

Since no datasets are identified, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. My final output will reflect that there are no datasets to report from this research paper.
