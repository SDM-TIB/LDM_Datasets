To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Optimize Industry-Scale Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problems" by Xijun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real-world data for experiments, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments over real-world data collected from a manufacturing campus with 27 factories. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

I will then check the **methodology** or **experiments** sections for any explicit names or descriptions of datasets. The authors mention that they collected historical data (delivery orders from July to October 2019) as the integrated dataset, which contains around 80,000 delivery orders. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection of delivery orders, so I will note that the dataset does not have a formal citation but is based on their own research.

The key datasets I will extract from the paper are:

1. **Integrated Dataset of Delivery Orders**: This dataset consists of historical delivery orders collected from July to October 2019, containing around 80,000 delivery orders. It is used for training and testing the proposed model.

Since this dataset is not formally published elsewhere, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Integrated Dataset of Delivery Orders
- **Description**: Historical delivery orders collected from July to October 2019, containing around 80,000 delivery orders used for training and testing the proposed model.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
