To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Numeric Reward Machines" by Kristina Levina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the introduction of numeric features into reward machines but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Craft domain** as the environment for their experiments. This indicates that the Craft domain is a dataset or a benchmark used for testing their proposed methods.

I will also check the **background section** (Section 2) to see if there are any references to other datasets or benchmarks that might have been used in prior work. The authors reference the work by Icarte et al. (2022), which may imply that they used datasets from that study as well.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations of any datasets mentioned. The Craft domain is cited as:
- Andreas, J.; Klein, D.; and Levine, S. (2017). *Modular Multitask Reinforcement Learning with Policy Sketches*. In International conference on machine learning, 166–175. PMLR.

Additionally, Icarte et al. (2022) is referenced, which may also provide insights into datasets used in their experiments:
- Icarte, R. T.; Klassen, T. Q.; Valenzano, R.; and McIlraith, S. A. (2022). *Reward Machines: Exploiting Reward Function Structure in Reinforcement Learning*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 73: 173–208.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key datasets identified from the paper are:
1. **Craft domain** - used for experimental evaluation.
   - Citation: Andreas, J.; Klein, D.; and Levine, S. (2017). *Modular Multitask Reinforcement Learning with Policy Sketches*. In International conference on machine learning, 166–175. PMLR.
   
2. **Reward Machines** - referenced from Icarte et al. (2022).
   - Citation: Icarte, R. T.; Klassen, T. Q.; Valenzano, R.; and McIlraith, S. A. (2022). *Reward Machines: Exploiting Reward Function Structure in Reinforcement Learning*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 73: 173–208.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
