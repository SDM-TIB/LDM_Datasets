To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MPC-based Reinforcement Learning for a Simplified Freight Mission of Autonomous Surface Vehicles" by Wenqi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may discuss the context and previous work, which could hint at datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for training or testing their proposed method. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often provides insights into how the datasets were utilized and their relevance to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "ASV Freight Dataset" or similar, I will look for the citation that provides the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
