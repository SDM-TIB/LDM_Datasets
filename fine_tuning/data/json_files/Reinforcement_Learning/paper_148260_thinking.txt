To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Engineering for Object Pick and Place Training" by Raghav Nagpal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of OpenAI's Gym for the Pick and Place environment, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this environment.

Next, I will focus on **section III (OpenAI Gym Environment and Baselines)**, where the authors mention the specific environment used for their experiments: **'FetchPickAndPlace-v1'**. This indicates that the dataset or environment is part of the OpenAI Gym library, which is a crucial detail for my extraction.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the OpenAI Gym or the specific environment mentioned. The authors reference OpenAI's baselines, which may provide additional context or citation for the dataset used.

The relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym environment is:
- OpenAI. *OpenAI Baselines*. https://github.com/openai/baselines, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or provide additional citations for other datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the **'FetchPickAndPlace-v1'** environment from OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
