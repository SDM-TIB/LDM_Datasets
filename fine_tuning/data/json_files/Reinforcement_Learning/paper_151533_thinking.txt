To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Root Cause Analysis of Outliers with Missing Structural Knowledge" by Nastaran Okati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analysis or experiments. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that for detailed descriptions.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for root cause analysis or anomaly detection. I will note down the names of these datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "PetShop dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Michaela Hardt, William Orchard, Patrick Blöbaum, Shiva Kasiviswanathan, and Elke Kirschbaum. *The PetShop Dataset – Finding Causes of Performance Issues Across Microservices*. 2023.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
