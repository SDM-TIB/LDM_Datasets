To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) Distribution Network Pricing in UK, advising China's Distribution Network" by Asad Mujeeb, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. In this section, I will look for specific datasets that were utilized in the simulations or analyses, such as the **IEEE-14 bus system** mentioned in the paper. I will note any relevant details about the dataset, including its structure, purpose, and any specific parameters used in the research.

I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that summarize data findings. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were analyzed and the outcomes of those analyses.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions the **IEEE-14 bus system**, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> "IEEE Power and Energy Society, 'IEEE 14-Bus Test Case,' IEEE, 1996."

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the research paper.
