To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High dimensional precision medicine from patient-derived xenografts" by Naim U. Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) studies, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to PDX models.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Large-Scale PDX Drug Screen for Treatment Response)**, where the authors provide an overview of the PDX data set used in their study. Here, they mention that the Novartis PDX study established a total of **1075 PDX lines** corresponding to various human cancers, which indicates that this is a significant dataset.

In this section, the authors also specify that **190 PDX lines** with complete genomic and response data were utilized for their analyses. They detail the types of cancer represented among these lines, including breast cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This information is crucial for understanding the scope of the dataset.

The authors also mention the genomic profiling of these lines, including gene expression data (399 lines), copy number analysis (375 lines), and mutations (399 lines). This indicates that there are multiple datasets derived from the same PDX lines, which I need to document separately.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Novartis PDX Study**: The citation for the study that established the PDX lines is:
   > Gao, H., Korn, J. M., Ferretti, S., Monahan, J. E., Wang, Y., Singh, M., Zhang, C., Schnell, C., Yang, G., Zhang, Y. et al. (2015). *High-throughput Screening Using Patient-derived Tumor Xenografts to Predict Clinical Trial Drug Response*. Nature Medicine, 21(11), 1318â€“1325.

2. **Genomic Data**: The genomic data derived from the PDX lines is not attributed to a single source but is part of the overall dataset described in the Novartis PDX study. Therefore, I will reference the same citation for the genomic data as well.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the PDX lines, the types of cancer represented, and the genomic profiling data.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- **Novartis PDX Study**: 1075 PDX lines, with 190 lines having complete genomic and response data.
- **Genomic Data**: Gene expression, copy number analysis, and mutation data from the PDX lines.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and included in the final output for each dataset.
