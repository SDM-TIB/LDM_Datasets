To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proper Value Equivalence" by Christopher Grimm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention any datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that might include datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will check there as well, as authors often discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their significance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Atari Learning Environment" as a dataset, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look like this:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have cross-verified the dataset names and citations with the references to avoid any inaccuracies. This thorough approach will help me extract and document the datasets effectively from the research paper.
