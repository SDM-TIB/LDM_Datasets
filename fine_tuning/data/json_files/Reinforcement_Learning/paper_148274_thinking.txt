To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Auto Encoder Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Resource Scheduling in Large-Scale MEC Networks" by Feibo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors discuss simulation parameters and performance metrics but do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they refer to various parameters and settings that may imply the use of certain datasets, such as the number of user equipments (UEs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will need to extract the full citations for those datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about any identified datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the complete citations for any datasets referenced in the paper, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methodology for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments and results sections for explicit dataset information.
3. Checking the references for any cited datasets.
4. Compiling the dataset information and ensuring full citations are included.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document any datasets mentioned in the paper effectively.
