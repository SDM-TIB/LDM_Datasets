To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploratory Lagrangian-Based Particle Tracing Using Deep Learning" by Mengjiao Han, Sudhanshu Sane, and Chris R. Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using a well-known analytical dataset, the **Double Gyre**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their study using the **Double Gyre** dataset, which is frequently used in fluid dynamics research. They describe the dataset in detail, including its temporal duration and the equations that define the flow field.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the **Double Gyre** dataset and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors discuss their methodology and the parameters used for training, but they primarily focus on the **Double Gyre** dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Double Gyre** dataset. The dataset is referenced as follows:
> Shadden, S.C., Lekien, F., and Marsden, J.E. "Definition and properties of Lagrangian coherent structures from finite-time Lyapunov exponents in two-dimensional aperiodic flows." *Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena*, 2005.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will only create an entry for the **Double Gyre** dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
