To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Benefits of Model-Based Generalization in Reinforcement Learning" by Kenny Young et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics or descriptions.

In this paper, the authors describe several environments used for their experiments, such as:

1. **ProcMaze**: A procedurally generated grid world maze where an agent navigates from a start state to a goal state. The dataset includes various maze configurations and transition dynamics.

2. **ButtonGrid**: A grid world with randomly placed buttons that the agent must toggle on to receive rewards. The dataset consists of different button configurations and the corresponding transitions.

3. **PanFlute**: An environment with combinatorial complexity where the agent must activate cells in a specific order to receive rewards. The dataset includes various configurations of pipes and their dynamics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for any datasets that are based on previously published works. If the datasets are original to this study, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors reference existing datasets, I will look for citations like:

- For **ProcMaze**, if it is based on a previously published work, I will find that citation.
- For **ButtonGrid** and **PanFlute**, I will do the same.

If the datasets are original, I will document them as follows:

- **ProcMaze**: Original dataset created for this study, consisting of procedurally generated mazes with various configurations.
- **ButtonGrid**: Original dataset created for this study, featuring a grid with randomly placed buttons.
- **PanFlute**: Original dataset created for this study, designed to test combinatorial complexity in reinforcement learning.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation if applicable. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
