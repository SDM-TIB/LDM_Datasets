To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhance Sample Efficiency and Robustness of End-to-end Urban Autonomous Driving via Semantic Masked World Model" by Zeyu Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **CARLA**, which suggests that this is a dataset or simulation environment used in their research. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on the **CARLA** simulator, which is a well-known open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. I will confirm if they provide specific details about the dataset or environment used within CARLA.

In the **experiments** section, I will check for any references to specific scenarios or configurations within CARLA that might be considered datasets. The authors mention using various weather conditions and urban environments, which could imply different configurations or subsets of the CARLA dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator. The citation for CARLA is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning (pp. 1-16).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reviewing the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Looking for a dedicated datasets section or relevant mentions in the experiments section.
3. Identifying the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used.
4. Retrieving the full citation for CARLA from the references.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for CARLA in the required format.
