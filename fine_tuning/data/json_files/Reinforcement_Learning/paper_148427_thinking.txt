To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smooth Exploration for Robotic Reinforcement Learning" by Antonin Raffin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on three different real robots, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these robots or the tasks they perform.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using **PyBullet environments** for simulation tasks. I will look for specific names of datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors specify four locomotion tasks from the **PyBullet** environments: **HALFCHEETAH, ANT, HOPPER, and WALKER2D**. These are indeed datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the PyBullet environments, but I can reference the original source of PyBullet:

- For **PyBullet**, the citation is:
  > E. Coumans and Y. Bai. *Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. http://pybullet.org, 2016â€“2019.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **HALFCHEETAH**: A locomotion task in the PyBullet environment.
2. **ANT**: Another locomotion task in the PyBullet environment.
3. **HOPPER**: A locomotion task in the PyBullet environment.
4. **WALKER2D**: A locomotion task in the PyBullet environment.

Since these tasks are part of the PyBullet simulation framework, I will use the citation for PyBullet as the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
