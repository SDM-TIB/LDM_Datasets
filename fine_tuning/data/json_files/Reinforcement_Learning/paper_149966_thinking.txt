To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety-Enhanced Autonomous Driving Using Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer" by Hao Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **CARLA benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets related to CARLA might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find specific mentions of datasets. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors describe the dataset collection process, stating that they ran a rule-based expert agent on all 8 towns and weather conditions in the CARLA simulator to collect an expert dataset of **3 million frames (410 hours)** for training and evaluation. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the CARLA simulator.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In the same section, the authors mention that they evaluated their methods on three benchmarks: **CARLA public leaderboard**, **Town05 benchmark**, and **CARLA 42 Routes benchmark**. However, these benchmarks are not datasets themselves but rather evaluation frameworks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The CARLA simulator is referenced in the paper, and the citation is as follows:

- For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 1–16. PMLR.

Since the dataset collected from the CARLA simulator is the primary dataset used in the experiments, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Expert Dataset from CARLA Simulator**: This dataset consists of 3 million frames collected from various towns and weather conditions in the CARLA simulator, used for training and evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset information and provided the necessary citations for future reference.
