To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extrinsically Rewarded Soft Q Imitation Learning with Discriminator" by Ryoma Furuyama et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on **MuJoCo environments**, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be included.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention evaluating their method on three specific environments: **Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and HalfCheetah-v2**. This indicates that these environments are likely associated with datasets used for training and testing their model.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The paper cites **MuJoCo** as the physics engine used for the experiments, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MuJoCo**: 
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the experiments as the environments from MuJoCo. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
