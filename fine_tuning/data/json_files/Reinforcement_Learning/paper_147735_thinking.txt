To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning using Augmented Neural Networks" by Jack Shannon and Marek Grzes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may mention prior work or datasets used in reinforcement learning, which could guide me to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly section 4, where the authors describe the experiments conducted. This section is likely to detail the specific environments or datasets used for testing their proposed methods. The authors mention testing on two classic control problems: **Mountain Car** and **Acrobot**, as well as a custom-designed **Spiral Maze Gridworld**.

I will then look for any references to datasets or environments in the text. For example, the **Mountain Car** problem is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and the **Acrobot** is another standard problem. The **Spiral Maze Gridworld** is a custom environment inspired by previous work, which I will also note.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The Mountain Car and Acrobot problems are often referenced in the literature, so I will look for their original sources:

1. **Mountain Car**:
   - Citation: 
     > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (1998). *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning*. MIT Press.

2. **Acrobot**:
   - Citation:
     > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (1998). *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning*. MIT Press.

3. **Spiral Maze Gridworld**:
   - The authors reference inspiration from Flake (2012) for this custom environment, so I will include that citation as well:
   - Citation:
     > Flake, G. W. (2012). *Square unit augmented, radially extended, multilayer perceptrons*. In Neural networks: tricks of the trade (pp. 143â€“161). Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
