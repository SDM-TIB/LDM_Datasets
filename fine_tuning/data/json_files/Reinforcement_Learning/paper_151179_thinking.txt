To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Style Transfer with Twin-Delayed DDPG for Shared Control of Robotic Manipulators" by Raul Fernandez-Fernandez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a custom Neural Style Transfer (NST) framework and mentions an evaluation with human subjects, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they mention that they used the **CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database** for training the autoencoder. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors describe the styles used for the robotic motions, which were derived from human demonstrations, but they do not mention any additional datasets beyond the CMU database.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database. The citation is as follows:
> "CMU graphics lab: Carnegie mellon university motion capture database," 2003. [Online]. Available: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information accordingly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
