To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Continual Learning via the Meta-learning Update with Multi-scale Knowledge Distillation and Data Augmentation" by Ya-nan Han and Jian-wei Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental evaluation is conducted on **four benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Split CIFAR10**: This dataset is derived from the CIFAR10 dataset, split into 5 disjoint tasks, each containing two classes. The images are processed into 32 Ã— 32 pixels.

2. **Split SVHN**: This dataset consists of 600,000 digit images from Google Street View, also split into 5 disjoint tasks with two classes each.

3. **Split CIFAR100**: The CIFAR100 dataset is divided into 20 disjoint subsets, each treated as a separate task.

4. **Split TinyImagenet200**: This dataset is a variant of Tiny-ImageNet, containing 200 classes split into 40 5-way classification tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImagenet**:
  > Guo, G., Yadav, K., Paull, L. *LA-MAML: Look-ahead Meta Learning for Continual Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.13904, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.
