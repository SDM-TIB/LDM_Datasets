To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Censored Deep Reinforcement Patrolling with Information Criterion for Monitoring Large Water Resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles" by Samuel Yanes et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) for monitoring water quality, which suggests that there may be datasets related to water quality measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, the authors mention the **Ypacaraí Lake** as the primary study area for their experiments. They describe the environment and the parameters used for monitoring, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset name. However, they refer to the use of a randomized benchmark function (Shekel function) for simulating water quality parameters, which indicates that the data used for training and testing may be synthetic rather than sourced from a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **Results and Discussion section** to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for comparison with their proposed method. They discuss performance metrics and comparisons with other algorithms, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. The references include various studies on water quality monitoring and autonomous vehicles, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Ypacaraí Lake Monitoring Data**: The study focuses on monitoring water quality in Ypacaraí Lake, Paraguay, using ASVs. However, no specific dataset is cited, and the data appears to be simulated based on a randomized benchmark function.

2. **Synthetic Data**: The authors mention using a Shekel function for simulating water quality parameters, but this does not constitute a traditional dataset with a citation.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the monitoring of water quality in Ypacaraí Lake and the use of synthetic data for simulations, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the primary data used in this research is synthetic and based on the Shekel function, without a formal dataset citation.
