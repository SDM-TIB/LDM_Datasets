To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for Provably Stable and Consistent Training of Deep Feedforward Networks" by Arunselvan Ramaswamy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving a classification task using images of cats and dogs, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention using a dataset from Kaggle for the classification task. They state that the dataset contains 10,000 images, with an equal number of dog and cat images, and that they used 8,000 images for training and 2,000 for testing. This is a clear indication of the dataset used.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the dataset as follows:

- **Cat and Dog Dataset**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog. 

The citation for this dataset can be formatted as:
> Tong, P. (2018). *Dogs vs. Cats: A dataset for image classification*. Kaggle. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and properly formatted.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for further processing or review.
