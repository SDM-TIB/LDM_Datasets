To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Independent Reinforcement Learning for Weakly Cooperative Multiagent Traffic Control Problem" by Chengwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that might include datasets.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using **two real traffic datasets and one synthetic dataset**. I will note down the names and details of these datasets as follows:

1. **Jinan Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of traffic data collected from 12 intersections in Jinan city, China. It includes vehicle arrival rates and other relevant traffic metrics.

2. **Hangzhou Traffic Dataset**: Similar to the Jinan dataset, this dataset contains traffic data from 16 intersections in Hangzhou city, China, with detailed statistics on vehicle flow.

3. **Synthetic Traffic Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a simulation environment and includes various traffic scenarios designed to test the proposed method under different conditions.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. If the datasets are derived from other studies or publicly available datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For example, if the Jinan and Hangzhou datasets are based on data from OpenStreetMap or other sources, I will include the appropriate citations for those sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are provided for each dataset, ready for downstream processing or review.
