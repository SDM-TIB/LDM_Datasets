To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMOGATOR: A NEW OPEN SOURCE VOCAL BURST DATASET WITH BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGIES" by Fred W. Buhl, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **EmoGator dataset**, which consists of 32,130 samples from 357 speakers, classified into 30 distinct emotion categories. This indicates that the dataset is significant and will be the primary focus.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for additional context about the dataset. The introduction discusses the importance of recognizing emotions in vocal bursts and mentions the EmoGator dataset as a solution to the lack of large datasets in this area. It also references a previous dataset by Cowen et al. that inspired this work, which may be relevant for citation purposes.

Moving on to **section 2.1 (The Dataset)**, I will find detailed information about the EmoGator dataset. This section provides specifics such as the number of samples, speakers, audio duration, and the emotion categories included. It confirms that the EmoGator dataset is balanced, with each of the 30 emotion categories having an equal number of samples.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 2.1**, the author compares the EmoGator dataset to the **Hume-VB dataset**, which consists of 59,201 vocalizations from 1702 speakers with 10 emotion categories. This comparison highlights the differences between the two datasets and provides another dataset to cite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **EmoGator dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
   > Fred W. Buhl. *EMOGATOR: A NEW OPEN SOURCE VOCAL BURST DATASET WITH BASELINE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGIES*. Preprint, April 7, 2023. Available at: https://github.com/fredbuhl/EmoGator.

2. For the **Hume-VB dataset**, I will find the original citation from the references. The relevant citation is:
   > Alice Baird, Panagiotis Tzirakis, Gauthier Gidel, Marco Jiralerspong, Eilif B. Muller, Kory Mathewson, Bj√∂rn Schuller, Erik Cambria, Dacher Keltner, and Alan Cowen. *The ICML 2022 Expressive Vocalizations Workshop and Competition: Recognizing, Generating, and Personalizing Vocal Bursts*. arXiv:2205.01780 [cs, eess], July 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the EmoGator dataset and the Hume-VB dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
