To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control" by Ruijie Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any initial mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using both synthetic and real-world data, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any further elaboration on the datasets used. The introduction discusses the importance of traffic signal control and mentions reinforcement learning but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The paper describes the experimental environment for synthetic data, which involves a four-way intersection with specific parameters such as road length and traffic light phases. The characteristics of this dataset are summarized in Table 4.

2. **Real-World Data**: This dataset is collected from surveillance cameras in Hangzhou, capturing traffic conditions at a four-way intersection over an hour. The details of this dataset are provided in Table 5.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic dataset is generated for the experiments, it may not have a formal citation. For the real-world dataset, I will need to check if the authors reference any specific studies or sources that describe the data collection process.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper does not provide a specific citation for the real-world dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on surveillance data but lacks a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries:

1. **Synthetic Data**: 
   - Description: A dataset created for the experiments involving a four-way intersection with specific traffic parameters.
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated dataset).

2. **Real-World Data**: 
   - Description: Traffic data collected from surveillance cameras in Hangzhou, capturing traffic conditions at a four-way intersection over one hour.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the synthetic dataset and the real-world dataset's reliance on surveillance data without a specific reference.
