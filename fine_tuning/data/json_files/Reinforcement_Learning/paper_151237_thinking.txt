To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RLEEGNet: Integrating Brain-Computer Interfaces with Adaptive AI for Intuitive Responsiveness and High-Accuracy Motor Imagery Classification" by Sriram Nallani and Gautham Ramachandran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present data processing methods for two EEG motor imagery datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the subsections that describe data preprocessing and feature extraction. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **GigaScience Dataset**: This dataset includes EEG files collected from 25 healthy subjects performing various upper-extremity movement tasks. The description details the number of trials, recording sessions, and the types of movements involved, which provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

2. **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a**: This dataset focuses on EEG data from 9 subjects participating in a cue-based BCI paradigm involving four different motor imagery tasks. The methodology section provides specifics about the number of trials, sessions, and the recording setup, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **GigaScience Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a**, the citation is:

Retrieved from https://lampx.tugraz.at/bci/database/001-2014/description.pdf

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
