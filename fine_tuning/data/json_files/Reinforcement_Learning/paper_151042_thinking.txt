To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demand response for residential building heating: Effective Monte Carlo Tree Search control based on physics-informed neural networks" by Fabio Pavirani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on demand response control and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 4.2 (Experiments setup)**, where the authors describe the experimental framework. Here, they mention using a benchmark model developed by Blum et al. (2021) and specifically reference the **BOPTEST-Gym** environment for generating time-series data. This indicates that the BOPTEST-Gym is a dataset or simulation environment used in their experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a detailed description of the data used in their experiments, including variables such as hour of the day, indoor temperature, outside temperature, heat pump modulation signal, heat pump electrical power consumed, and energy prices. This table is crucial as it summarizes the dataset's structure and the types of data collected.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the BOPTEST-Gym environment and the benchmark model developed by Blum et al. (2021). I will extract the full citation for this benchmark model from the references section:

- For **BOPTEST-Gym**, the citation is:
  > Blum, D., Arroyo, J., Huang, S., Drgoňa, J., Jorissen, F., Walnum, H.T., Chen, Y., Benne, K., Vrabie, D., Wetter, M., et al. (2021). *Building optimization testing framework (BOPTEST) for simulation-based benchmarking of control strategies in buildings*. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 14(6), 586–610.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:

1. **BOPTEST-Gym**: A simulation environment used for generating time-series data related to building energy management.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
