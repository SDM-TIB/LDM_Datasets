To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ExIt-OOS: Towards Learning from Planning in Imperfect Information Games" by Andy C. Kitchen and Michela Benedetti, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention specific games used for testing their algorithm. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets or game environments referenced.

In section 4 (Experiments), the authors mention three specific games used for their experiments:

1. **Leduc Poker**: A simplified poker variant with specific rules and structure. The authors reference a prior work for the dataset used in this game.
   
2. **II Goofspiel**: Another game variant with its own set of rules and structure. The authors provide details about the number of cards and rounds, which indicates the dataset's nature.

3. **Liar’s Dice**: A bluffing game played with dice, which is also described in detail. The authors do not provide a specific dataset citation but refer to the game mechanics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or related works mentioned. For the games referenced, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets or rules in detail.

- For **Leduc Poker**, the citation is:
  > Finnegan Southey, Michael P Bowling, Bryce Larson, Carmelo Piccione, Neil Burch, Darse Billings, and Chris Rayner. *Bayes’ bluff: Opponent modelling in poker*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.1411, 2012.

- For **II Goofspiel**, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but it is a known game variant in the literature. I will note that it is commonly referenced in game theory contexts.

- For **Liar’s Dice**, similar to II Goofspiel, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is a well-known game.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for Leduc Poker and noting the common knowledge status of II Goofspiel and Liar’s Dice.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and attributed.
