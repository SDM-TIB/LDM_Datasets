To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Matthias Gerstgrasser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that describe the environments used for testing the proposed method. The authors mention that they evaluate their approach on several benchmark domains, which is a strong indication that datasets are involved.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention using environments from the **PettingZoo package** and the **MeltingPot package**. They describe various domains such as "Pursuit," "Battle," and "Adversarial Pursuit," which are part of these packages. I will need to confirm that these environments correspond to specific datasets or benchmarks.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets or environments mentioned. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset.

1. **PettingZoo package**: The authors mention using three domains from this package, which are:
   - **Pursuit**: A semi-cooperative environment where agents must capture evaders.
   - **Battle**: A semi-adversarial environment where two teams compete against each other.
   - **Adversarial Pursuit**: A predator-prey environment with distinct roles for agents.

2. **MeltingPot package**: The authors describe using three domains from this package, which are:
   - **Cooperative Mining**: A collaborative resource harvesting game.
   - **Rationalizable Coordination**: A coordination game embedded in a larger environment.
   - **Stag Hunt**: A game theory scenario embedded in a larger game world.

Next, I will look for the full citations for the PettingZoo and MeltingPot packages in the references. The relevant citations are likely to be found in the references section, where the authors provide details about the packages and their respective environments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
