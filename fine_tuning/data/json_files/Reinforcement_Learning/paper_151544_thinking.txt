To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ablation Based Counterfactuals" by Zheng Dai and David K. Gifford, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and appendix sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "massive corpuses of training data," which suggests that specific datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the importance of training data in the context of diffusion models. They mention various applications but do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **Methods section**, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets.

In **section 2.1 (Preliminaries)**, the authors describe the training data and its sources, but they do not list specific datasets. I will then check **section 3 (Results)**, where they summarize the experiments conducted. Here, they mention training on various datasets, specifically in **section 3.1**, where they list the ensembles trained on different datasets.

The paper provides a summary of datasets used in **Table B.1 (Appendix)**, which is crucial for my extraction. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
   - Citation: LeCun et al. (2010). *MNIST handwritten digit database*. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

2. **FASHION**: A dataset for clothing item classification.
   - Citation: Xiao et al. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

5. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset.
   - Citation: Liu et al. (2018). *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (CelebA) dataset*. Available: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.

6. **MetFaces**: A dataset of artworks.
   - Citation: Karras et al. (2020). *Training generative adversarial networks with limited data*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33:12104â€“12114.

7. **ArtBench**: A dataset for benchmarking generative models with artworks.
   - Citation: Liao et al. (2022). *The ArtBench dataset: Benchmarking generative models with artworks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.11404.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they appear in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
