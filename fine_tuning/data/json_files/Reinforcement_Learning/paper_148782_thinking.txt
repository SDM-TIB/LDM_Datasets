To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crowdsourced Urban Delivery" by Tanvir Ahamed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically describes the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the proposed models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide results based on the datasets, which can help confirm their relevance. If the authors discuss the datasets in detail, I will note their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Crowdshipping Dataset" and provides details about its structure and usage, I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
