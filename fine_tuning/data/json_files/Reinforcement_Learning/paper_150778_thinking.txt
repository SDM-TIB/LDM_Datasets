To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-inspired Equivariant Descriptors of Non-bonded Interactions" by Kevin K. Huguenin-Dumittan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific features relevant to the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **BioFragment Database (BFDb)**, which contains 2291 pairs created from 22 relaxed organic molecules. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments and any additional datasets that may be referenced. The experiments section often provides insights into how the datasets were applied in the context of the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **BioFragment Database (BFDb)**, I will note the citation as follows:
> Burns, L. A.; Faver, J. C.; Zheng, Z.; Marshall, M. S.; Smith, D. G. A.; Vanommeslaeghe, K.; MacKerell, A. D.; Merz, K. M.; Sherrill, C. D. The BioFragment Database (BFDb): An Open-Data Platform for Computational Chemistry Analysis of Noncovalent Interactions. *J. Chem. Phys.* 2017, 147, 161727.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and presented in an organized manner.
