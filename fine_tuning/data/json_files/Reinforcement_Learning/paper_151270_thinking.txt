To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing and Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Parameter Efficient Tuning" by Weijieying Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs) and mention that they conducted experiments across eight domain-specific continual learning benchmarks. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5.1.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets organized under two categories: CL benchmarks for LLMs and general benchmarks for LLMs.

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **ScienceQA**: A dataset for science question answering.
   - Citation: Lu, P., Mishra, S., Xia, T., Qiu, L., Chang, K.-W., Zhu, S.-C., Tafjord, O., Clark, P., & Kalyan, A. (2022). Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering.

2. **MedMCQA**: A large-scale multi-subject multi-choice dataset for medical domain question answering.
   - Citation: Pal, A., Kumar Umapathi, L., & Sankarasubbu, M. (2022). MedMCQA: A large-scale multi-subject multi-choice dataset for medical domain question answering. In Proceedings of the Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning, volume 174 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 248–260.

3. **FOMC**: A dataset related to the Federal Open Market Committee.
   - Citation: Shah, A., Paturi, S., & Chava, S. (2023). Trillion dollar words: A new financial dataset, task & market analysis. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 6664–6679.

4. **JEC-QA**: A legal-domain question answering dataset.
   - Citation: Zhong, H., Xiao, C., Tu, C., Zhang, T., Liu, Z., & Sun, M. (2020). JEC-QA: A legal-domain question answering dataset. In Proceedings of AAAI.

5. **MeetingBank**: A benchmark dataset for meeting summarization.
   - Citation: Hu, Y., Ganter, T., Deilamsalehy, H., Dernoncourt, F., Foroosh, H., & Liu, F. (2023). MeetingBank: A benchmark dataset for meeting summarization.

6. **C-STANCE**: A dataset for Chinese zero-shot stance detection.
   - Citation: Zhao, C., Li, Y., & Caragea, C. (2023). C-STANCE: A large dataset for Chinese zero-shot stance detection. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 13369–13385.

7. **20Minuten**: A multi-task news summarization dataset for German.
   - Citation: Kew, T., Kostrzewa, M., & Ebling, S. (2023). 20 Minuten: A multi-task news summarisation dataset for German.

8. **NumGLUE**: A suite of fundamental yet challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.
   - Citation: Mishra, S., Mitra, A., Varshney, N., Sachdeva, B., Clark, P., Baral, C., & Kalyan, A. (2022). NumGLUE: A suite of fundamental yet challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for future reference.
