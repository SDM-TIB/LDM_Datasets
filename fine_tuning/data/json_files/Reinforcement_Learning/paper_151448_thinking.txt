To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaskFuser: Masked Fusion of Joint Multi-Modal Tokenization for End-to-End Autonomous Driving" by Yiqun Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that MaskFuser achieves a driving score of 49.05 and route completion of 92.85% on the **CARLA LongSet6 benchmark evaluation**. This indicates that the CARLA LongSet6 dataset is likely a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they collected 1000 routes in 8 officially provided town maps from the CARLA simulator, which suggests that the CARLA dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the evaluation metrics and mention the **LongSet6 benchmark** specifically. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their evaluation process.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset and the LongSet6 benchmark. The CARLA simulator is referenced multiple times, and I will ensure to capture the correct citation format.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

Additionally, the LongSet6 benchmark is derived from the CARLA simulator, so I will reference the CARLA citation for it as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The key dataset identified is the CARLA LongSet6 benchmark, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output.
