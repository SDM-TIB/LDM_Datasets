To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Machine Unlearning Without Retraining Through Selective Synaptic Dampening" by Jack Foster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate their method on **CIFAR10, CIFAR20, CIFAR100**, and the **PinsFaceRecognition dataset**. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to describe.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets within the paper. For instance, the authors mention that CIFAR10, CIFAR20, and CIFAR100 are standard datasets for image classification tasks, while the PinsFaceRecognition dataset consists of 17,534 faces of 105 celebrities collected from Pinterest. This information is crucial for providing context about the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR10, CIFAR20, and CIFAR100**: These datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I can cite them as follows:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2010). Convolutional deep belief networks on CIFAR-10. Unpublished manuscript.

2. **PinsFaceRecognition Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Burak. (2020). *Pinterest Face Recognition Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hereisburak/pins-face-recognition.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for review or further processing.
