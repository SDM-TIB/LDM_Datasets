To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segmentation-Consistent Probabilistic Lesion Counting" by Julien Schroeter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a proprietary dataset of MRI scans from patients with Multiple Sclerosis, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of MRI scans from 1067 patients undergoing a clinical trial for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). They mention that the dataset includes five types of MRI sequences and that the data was processed to ensure no patient appeared in more than one dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work by Karimaghaloo et al. (2016) for details about the dataset. Therefore, I will extract the citation for that paper as it serves as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Zahra Karimaghaloo, Douglas L. Arnold, and Tal Arbel. *Adaptive multi-level conditional random fields for detection and segmentation of small enhanced pathology in medical images*. Medical Image Analysis, 27:17â€“30, 2016.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Proprietary dataset of MRI scans for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS).
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of MRI scans from 1067 patients, monitored over three years with annual scans. It includes five types of MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast, T2-weighted, Fluid Attenuated Inverse Recovery, and Proton Density weighted).
   - **Citation**: Karimaghaloo, Z., Arnold, D. L., & Arbel, T. (2016). *Adaptive multi-level conditional random fields for detection and segmentation of small enhanced pathology in medical images*. Medical Image Analysis, 27, 17-30.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review.
