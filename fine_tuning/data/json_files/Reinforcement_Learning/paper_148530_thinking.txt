To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Reinforcement Learning to Herd a Robotic Swarm to a Target Distribution" by Zahi Kakish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention datasets used for validation or comparison, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. If the authors describe any simulations or experiments, they might reference specific datasets or environments used for training or testing their algorithms.

In this paper, the authors describe a simulation environment created using OpenAI Gym, which is a significant clue that there may be datasets or environments relevant to the experiments. I will check if they provide any specific dataset names or references to existing datasets used in their simulations.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the OpenAI Gym environment, I will note that the citation for this is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

If they refer to any specific datasets related to swarm robotics or reinforcement learning, I will ensure to extract those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
