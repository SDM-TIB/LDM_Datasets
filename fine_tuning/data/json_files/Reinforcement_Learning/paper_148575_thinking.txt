To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lagrangian Duality in Reinforcement Learning" by Pranay Pasula, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to find any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and their historical context but does not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Duality in Learning from Demonstration)**, which discusses Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) and other learning paradigms. Here, the author mentions that GAIL learns from expert demonstrations but does not specify any datasets used for these demonstrations.

I will also check **section 5 (Duality in Policy Search)**, which covers various RL algorithms like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). However, the section primarily focuses on theoretical aspects and does not provide information about specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments or methodologies discussed. The author references various algorithms and concepts in reinforcement learning but does not cite any datasets.

Since I did not find any datasets in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have proceeded to locate their full citations in the **References section** to ensure proper documentation.

In summary, I will note that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction, and therefore, there are no citations to compile.
