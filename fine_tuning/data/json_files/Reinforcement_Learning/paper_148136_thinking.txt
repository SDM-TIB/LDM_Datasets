To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GACNN: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm" by Parsa Esfahanian and Mohammad Akhavan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used in previous works.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using two datasets for training their convolutional neural networks: **MNIST** and **CIFAR10**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant statistics.

In the evaluation section, the authors state:
- For the **MNIST dataset**, they used 70,000 images for training and validation and 10,000 images for testing.
- For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, they used 50,000 images for training and validation and 10,000 images for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
