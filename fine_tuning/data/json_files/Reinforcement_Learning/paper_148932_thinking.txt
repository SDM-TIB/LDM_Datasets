To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visualizing MuZero Models" by Joery A. de Vries et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors provide an open-source implementation of MuZero along with an interactive visualizer, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the MuZero algorithm and its applications but does not explicitly mention any datasets either.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this section, the authors state that they tested their work on low-dimensional classic control environments from OpenAIâ€™s Gym, specifically mentioning **CartPole** and **MountainCar**. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **results** section to confirm the use of these datasets. The authors present results for both CartPole and MountainCar, reinforcing that these are indeed the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since CartPole and MountainCar are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the citation for the OpenAI Gym itself:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **CartPole**: A classic control environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.
2. **MountainCar**: Another classic control environment where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I provide the necessary details for each dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
