To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forensic Similarity for Digital Images" by Owen Mayer and Matthew C. Stamm, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments conducted. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for training and evaluation. For instance, the authors mention using three publicly available datasets for forgery detection: **Columbia**, **Carvalho**, and **Korus et al.** datasets. I will note these datasets and their purposes.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their usage. For example, Table I lists camera models used in training and testing, which may indicate the datasets from which these images were sourced.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **Columbia Dataset**: I will find the original paper or source that describes this dataset.
2. **Carvalho Dataset**: Similarly, I will locate the citation for this dataset.
3. **Korus et al. Dataset**: I will find the reference for this dataset as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description of its purpose, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
