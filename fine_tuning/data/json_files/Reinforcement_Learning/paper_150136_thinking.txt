To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out of Distribution Reasoning by Weakly-Supervised Disentangled Logic Variational Autoencoder" by Zahra Rahiminasab et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on the **Carla dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the **Carla dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They provide details about how they generated images using the Carla simulator and the specific generative factors they considered (city and rain).

I will also check the **data partitioning section** where they describe how they created different partitions based on the generative factors. They mention that they gathered images from various cities and different rain intensities, which further confirms the use of the Carla dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Carla dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv [cs.LG], pp. 1â€“16.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Carla Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed OOD reasoning framework. It is generated using the Carla simulator, which allows for the creation of images under various conditions, including different cities and rain intensities.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
