To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design of Artificial Intelligence Agents for Games using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Andrei-Claudiu Roibu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often outlines the objectives and context of the research, which can also hint at the datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the author discusses the environments used for training the AI agents, such as "OpenAI Gym’s Atari environment" and specific games like "CartPole," "MountainCar," and "Acrobot." These are key indicators that datasets are involved.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the author references any datasets used for evaluation or comparison. The author mentions using the Arcade Learning Environment for Atari games, which is a significant dataset in reinforcement learning research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the paper may reference foundational works or datasets related to the Atari games or the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

The datasets I will extract include:

1. **OpenAI Gym’s Atari Environment**: This dataset includes various Atari games used for training reinforcement learning agents.
   - Citation: Bellemare, M. G. et al. (2013) ‘The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents’, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015-Janua, pp. 4148–4152. doi: 10.1613/jair.3912.

2. **CartPole**: A classic control problem used as a benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Citation: Sutton, R. S. and Barto, A. G. (2018) *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. Second Edition. London, England: MIT Press.

3. **MountainCar**: Another classic control problem that tests the agent's ability to build momentum.
   - Citation: Sutton, R. S. and Barto, A. G. (2018) *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. Second Edition. London, England: MIT Press.

4. **Acrobot**: A more complex control problem involving a two-link robotic arm.
   - Citation: Sutton, R. S. and Barto, A. G. (2018) *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. Second Edition. London, England: MIT Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
