To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superior Genetic Algorithms for the Target Set Selection Problem Based on Power-Law Parameter Choices and Simple Greedy Heuristics" by Benjamin Doerr, Martin S. Krejca, and Nguyen Vu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which they are used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the target set selection problem (TSS) and reference previous works. This section may contain citations to datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

I will then examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on various social networks, which suggests that these networks are the datasets of interest.

In the **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, including their characteristics such as the number of vertices and edges. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the authors reference the following datasets:
1. **Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) Datasets**: This collection includes various social networks used in their experiments. The citation is:
   > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. 2014. SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

2. **Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)**: While not a dataset, it is a method referenced in the context of the experiments. The citation is:
   > Albert López Serrano and Christian Blum. 2022. A biased random key genetic algorithm applied to target set selection in viral marketing. In Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022. ACM, 241–250. https://doi.org/10.1145/3512290.3528785.

3. **Q-Learning Ant Colony Optimization**: Another method referenced in the context of the experiments. The citation is:
   > Jairo Enrique Ramírez Sánchez, Camilo Chacón Sartori, and Christian Blum. 2023. Q-Learning ant colony optimization supported by deep learning for target set selection. In Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2023. ACM, 357–366. https://doi.org/10.1145/3583131.3590396.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
