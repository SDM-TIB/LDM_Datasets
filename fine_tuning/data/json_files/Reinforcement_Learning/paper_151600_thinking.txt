To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Fusion and Task Guided Embedding for End-to-end Autonomous Driving" by Yipin Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method was evaluated on the **CARLA simulation platform**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors discuss the dataset used for training and testing. In this section, they specify that they used the **CARLA simulator**, particularly version 0.9.10, for their experiments. They also mention that seven towns were used for training and Town05 was selected for evaluation due to its diversity in drivable regions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CARLA**:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

Since the CARLA simulator is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
