To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smoothed functional-based gradient algorithms for off-policy reinforcement learning: A non-asymptotic viewpoint" by Nithia Vijayan and Prashanth L. A., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the algorithms proposed, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section**, where they describe the experimental setup and the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the **CartPole** control problem from the OpenAI Gym toolkit. This is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and it is crucial to note that the dataset here refers to the simulation environment rather than a traditional dataset with labeled data.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the CartPole environment or any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the OpenAI Gym toolkit, which is the source of the CartPole environment.

The full citation for the OpenAI Gym toolkit is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

Since the CartPole environment is part of the OpenAI Gym, I will include this citation as the dataset reference.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **CartPole Environment**: This is the primary dataset used in the experiments, which is part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and completeness, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym toolkit as the source of the dataset.
