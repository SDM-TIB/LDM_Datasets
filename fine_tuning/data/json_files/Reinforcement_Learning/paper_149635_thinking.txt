To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Estimation with Discrete Stein Operators" by Jiaxin Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments. If no datasets are mentioned here, I will continue to the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets or experimental setups. 

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **Omniglot** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including any specific configurations or splits mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

3. **Omniglot Dataset**:
   > Brenden M Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332–1338, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
