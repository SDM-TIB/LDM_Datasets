To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An efficient data-based off-policy Q-learning algorithm for optimal output feedback control of linear systems" by Mohammad Alsalti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to look for any specific datasets used in the study. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using **input-output data** collected from systems, but they do not specify any named datasets. Instead, they refer to the data collected from experiments conducted on various linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not standard datasets but rather data generated from the experiments described in the paper.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited or if the authors refer to previous works that may have used specific datasets. However, in this case, the references primarily discuss algorithms and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the data collection process described in the paper instead. The authors mention that they collected input-output data from the systems using persistently exciting inputs, which is crucial for the algorithm's performance.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant details about the data collection process and its significance in the context of the research.

In conclusion, while this paper does not reference specific datasets with full citations, it emphasizes the importance of the input-output data collected from experiments on LTI systems, which serves as the foundation for the proposed Q-learning algorithm.
