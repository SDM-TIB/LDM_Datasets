To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking a (µ + λ) Genetic Algorithm with Configurable Crossover Probability" by Furong Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may highlight key datasets used for benchmarking. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Algorithms and Benchmarks)**, particularly **subsection 2.2 (The IOHprofiler Problem Set)**, where the authors describe the benchmark problems used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In subsection 2.2, the authors mention the **IOHprofiler problem set**, which consists of 25 real-valued pseudo-Boolean test problems. They list specific problems such as **OneMax**, **LeadingOnes**, and others, providing a brief description of each. I will note down the names and any relevant details provided.

Additionally, I will check **section 2.3 (Data Availability)**, where the authors mention that detailed results for the different configurations of the (µ + λ) GA are available in their data repository. This section may provide a link or reference to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **IOHprofiler** in the following way:

- For the **IOHprofiler problem set**, the citation is:
  > Doerr, C., Wang, H., Ye, F., van Rijn, S., Bäck, T. (2018). *IOHprofiler: A benchmarking and profiling tool for iterative optimization heuristics*. arXiv e-prints:1810.05281. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05281

Next, I will also note the specific problems mentioned in the paper, such as:

1. **OneMax**: A classic optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the number of ones in a binary string.
2. **LeadingOnes**: A problem where the fitness value depends on the number of leading ones in a binary string.

For each of these problems, I will ensure to provide the appropriate citations if they are referenced in the literature.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in this research paper.
