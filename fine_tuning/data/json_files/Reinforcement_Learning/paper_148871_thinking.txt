To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indoor Group Activity Recognition Using Multi-Layered HMMs" by Vinayak Elangovan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the recognition of group activities based on imagery data processing, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to video imagery.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author discusses the challenges of Group Activity Recognition (GAR) and mentions various human interactions. I will look for any specific datasets that may have been used in previous studies referenced in this section.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of experiments or data collection methods. The author mentions using observations from video imagery, which may indicate the use of specific datasets for training or testing their models.

I will also examine the **experimental results section** to see if the author provides details about the datasets used in their experiments. The paper describes a scenario involving three humans and two cardboard boxes, which may imply the use of a custom dataset created for this study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for providing proper attribution to the datasets used in the research. I will look for any papers or datasets that are explicitly mentioned as sources of data.

If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note any relevant datasets that are implied through the methodology or experimental setup. For example, if the paper references a specific dataset for human activity recognition, I will include that in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
