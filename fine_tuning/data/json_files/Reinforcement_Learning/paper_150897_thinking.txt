To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Continuous Control with Consistency Policy" by Haoran Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various offline and online tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors present results on several tasks, and they mention specific datasets in the context of their experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors refer to the **D4RL benchmark** and **dm_control tasks**. These are key datasets used for evaluating their method. 

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark is specifically designed for offline reinforcement learning and includes various datasets for different tasks. The authors mention that their method achieves competitive performance on this benchmark.

2. **dm_control Tasks**: This is another set of tasks used for online reinforcement learning, which the authors also evaluate their method against.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **D4RL benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. CoRR abs/2004.07219 (2020). arXiv:2004.07219.

- For the **dm_control tasks**, the citation is:
  > Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy P. Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *dm_control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Softw. Impacts 6 (2020), 100022. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2020.100022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
