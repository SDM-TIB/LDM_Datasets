To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Genetic Algorithms with Deep Neural Networks for Exploring the Chemical Space" by Akshat Kumar Nigam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the design of organic materials and molecules, hinting at the use of datasets for optimization tasks.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. Here, the authors mention the use of computational tools and optimization problems, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where datasets are likely to be detailed. In **subsection 4.1**, the authors mention a reference dataset consisting of **250,000 commercially available molecules extracted from the ZINC database**. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **references section** of the paper. The citation for the ZINC database is as follows:
> John J. Irwin, Teague Sterling, Michael M. Mysinger, Erin S. Bolstad, and Ryan G. Coleman. *ZINC: A Free Tool to Discover Chemistry for Biology*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(7):1757â€“1768, 2012.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In the **related works section**, the authors reference various models and datasets used in previous studies, but they do not specify additional datasets used in their own experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ZINC dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details and citations are included for clarity and completeness.
