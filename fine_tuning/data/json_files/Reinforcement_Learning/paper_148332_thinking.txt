To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Experience Replay" by Jieliang Luo and Hui Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on robotic assembly tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section (Section 4)**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments used for testing their method. They mention two specific tasks: **peg-in-hole** and **lap-joint**. I will check if these tasks are associated with any publicly available datasets or if they are based on custom simulations.

In **Section 4.1 (Environments)**, the authors state that they modeled their assembly tasks in the **PyBullet simulation engine**. They describe the peg-in-hole task using a KUKA robotic arm and the lap-joint task in a robot-less setup. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets that are publicly available or referenced.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather describes the simulation environments used for their experiments, I will note that the experiments are based on custom simulations rather than established datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets. I will note that the experiments were conducted using simulated environments in PyBullet, and while the tasks are well-defined, they do not reference any external datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings into a structured output that reflects the absence of publicly available datasets while acknowledging the use of custom simulations for the experiments.
