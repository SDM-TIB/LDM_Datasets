To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Attacks on Deep Algorithmic Trading Policies" by Yaser Faghan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in algorithmic trading and mentions the evaluation of proposed attack techniques against benchmark and real-world DQN trading agents. This suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental environments. Here, they mention two specific environments used for their experiments:

1. **Basic Trading Environment**: This environment uses data sourced from the Russian stock market prices between 2015 and 2016. The dataset consists of one-minute interval samples capturing open, high, low, and close prices.

2. **TensorTrade Environment**: This environment utilizes a dataset from the start of 2020, which includes open, high, low, close, and volume prices at hourly intervals, along with technical indicators like the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from specific market data and not from standalone publications, I will note that the authors have not provided formal citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and details as described in the paper:

1. **Russian Stock Market Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains one-minute interval data from the Russian stock market, including open, high, low, and close prices from 2015 to 2016.
   - Citation: Not formally cited in the paper.

2. **TensorTrade Dataset**: 
   - Description: Comprises hourly interval data from the start of 2020, including open, high, low, close, and volume prices, along with technical indicators such as RSI and MACD.
   - Citation: Not formally cited in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset descriptions are clear and concise, ready for any structured output or further processing as needed.
