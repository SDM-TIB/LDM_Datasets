To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Acting in Delayed Environments with Non-Stationary Markov Policies" by Esther Derman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets that are foundational to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 7, where they mention the environments used for testing their algorithm. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets or environments that are explicitly named.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several environments, including:
1. **Tabular Maze Domain**: This is based on tabular Q-learning and is used to study the merits of the proposed method.
2. **CartPole**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
3. **Acrobot**: Another reinforcement learning environment where the objective is to swing up a two-link robot arm.
4. **Atari Learning Environment**: The authors mention testing their algorithm on various Atari games, which are well-known benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. The paper may not provide formal citations for all environments, especially if they are widely recognized benchmarks. However, I can still document them based on their common references in the literature.

For the environments mentioned, I will compile the following citations:
- **Tabular Maze Domain**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540v1.

- **CartPole**: 
  > Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., & Anderson, C. W. (1983). Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problems. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 13(5), 834-846.

- **Acrobot**: 
  > The Acrobot environment is part of the OpenAI Gym and does not have a separate citation but is commonly referenced alongside the Gym.

- **Atari Learning Environment**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
