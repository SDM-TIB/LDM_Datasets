To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of a District Cooling Energy Plant" by Zhong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of numerical simulation results, which may indicate the presence of datasets used for training or validation. The introduction may provide context on the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors describe the datasets used for model calibration and validation. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **system description** and **model calibration** sections, I will look for references to any datasets used for model identification or validation. The authors may mention specific datasets that were instrumental in developing their simulation models or validating their results.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset from a specific university or organization, I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication details, and any relevant URLs if available.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future use or verification.
