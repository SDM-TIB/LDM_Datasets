To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Neural Architecture Search" by Seyed Saeed Changiz Rezaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on "three public NAS benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three benchmarks:

1. **NAS-Bench-101**: This benchmark is described as containing 423,624 DAG-style cell-based architectures, each trained and evaluated for accuracy. It is a significant dataset for neural architecture search.

2. **NAS-Bench-201**: This dataset consists of 15,625 evaluated cells, with architecture cells made up of 6 searchable edges and 5 candidate operations. It is used for evaluating NAS algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120.

3. **NAS-Bench-301**: This benchmark provides a formal evaluation for 1,018 architectures in the DARTS search space, allowing for comparisons across different NAS methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NAS-Bench-101**, the citation is:
  > Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 7105â€“7114.

- For **NAS-Bench-201**, the citation is:
  > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **NAS-Bench-301**, the citation is:
  > Siems, J., Zimmer, L., Zela, A., Lukasik, J., Keuper, M., & Hutter, F. (2020). *NAS-Bench-301 and the Case for Surrogate Benchmarks for Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.09777.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
