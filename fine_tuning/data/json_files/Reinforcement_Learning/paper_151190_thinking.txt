To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DRL-Based Dynamic Channel Access and SCLAR Maximization for Networks Under Jamming" by Abdul Basit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used. The introduction often discusses previous work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about each dataset, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will search for the original paper that introduced the dataset to ensure I provide the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format for easy reference, making sure that the citations are complete and correctly formatted according to academic standards.
