To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Dimensional Reward Functions" by Pushi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used for validation and testing.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used during the experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on **Atari games** and **maze environments**. I will note the specific games and environments mentioned, as these are likely to be the datasets used for their experiments. For instance, the paper lists six Atari games: **AirRaid, Asteroids, Gopher, MsPacman, UpNDown, and Pong**. Each of these games serves as a dataset for evaluating the proposed method.

Additionally, the paper discusses three maze environments: **maze-exclusive, maze-identical, and maze-multireward**. These environments are also treated as datasets for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for any datasets that are based on existing works. If the datasets are original or created by the authors, I will note that as well.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Atari Games**:
   - For the Atari games, the citation is:
     > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. **Maze Environments**:
   - The maze environments are original to this study and do not have a separate citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the Atari games and noting the original nature of the maze environments. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
