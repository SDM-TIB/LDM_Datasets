To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XPROAX: Local explanations for text classification with progressive neighborhood approximation" by Yi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section V (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Yelp reviews**: This dataset consists of restaurant reviews, each limited to 16 words, and is labeled as either positive or negative.
2. **Amazon reviews polarity**: This dataset includes customer reviews about various products, with ratings from 1 to 5 stars. The authors note that neutral reviews (3 stars) were discarded, and reviews with ≤ 2 stars were labeled as negative, while those with ≥ 4 stars were labeled as positive.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Yelp reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For the **Amazon reviews polarity dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 649–657, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
