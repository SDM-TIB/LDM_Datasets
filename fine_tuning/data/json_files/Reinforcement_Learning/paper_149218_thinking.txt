To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constraints Penalized Q-learning for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Haoran Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new algorithm for safe offline reinforcement learning, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of learning from offline data but do not name any specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, specifically mentioning that they conducted experiments on three Mujoco tasks: **Hopper-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, and Walker2d-v2**. They indicate that the datasets used for these experiments consist of a mixture of transitions collected from both safe and unsafe policies, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the Mujoco tasks or datasets. The references include various papers, but they do not provide specific citations for the Mujoco environments themselves. However, I can infer that the Mujoco environments are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

To provide proper citations for the Mujoco tasks, I will refer to the original Mujoco paper:

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets used in the experiments, I will compile the dataset entries with their citations. The datasets are:

1. **Hopper-v2**: A continuous control task where the agent learns to balance and move a simulated one-legged hopper.
2. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A continuous control task where the agent learns to control a simulated cheetah to run as fast as possible.
3. **Walker2d-v2**: A continuous control task where the agent learns to walk in a simulated 2D environment.

The citations for these datasets will refer to the Mujoco paper as they are standard environments:

- For **Hopper-v2**, **HalfCheetah-v2**, and **Walker2d-v2**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
