To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aerial-Aided mmWave VANETs Using NOMA" by Abdullah Abu Zaid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will check if any datasets are mentioned that are used for performance analysis or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss related works and may mention datasets used in previous studies. This section may provide context for the datasets that the authors are using or comparing against.

I will then examine the **methodology section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe their experimental setup, including any datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons that reinforce the significance of the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them with the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the paper effectively, ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset identified.
