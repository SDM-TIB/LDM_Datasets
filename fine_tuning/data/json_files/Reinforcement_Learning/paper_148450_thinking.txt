To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles Using Learned Models of Agent Futures" by Allen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the **Argoverse** and **CARLA** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe their model training and validation processes. They state that the GMM position predictor is trained on a subset of the **Argoverse dataset** and that the GMM control predictor uses data collected from the **CARLA** simulator. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **Argoverse dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chang, M.-F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, A., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D. (2019). *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8748–8757.

2. For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1–16.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper attribution to the original sources.
