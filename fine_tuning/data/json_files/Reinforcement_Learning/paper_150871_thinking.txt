To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expected Flow Networks in Stochastic Environments and Two-Player Zero-Sum Games" by Marco Jiralerspong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "our experiments involved."

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for subsections specifically dedicated to datasets, as they often contain detailed descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to stochastic environments or two-player games, possibly including benchmarks or standard datasets in the field of reinforcement learning or game theory.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will involve summarizing the key details of each dataset, such as its name, purpose, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
