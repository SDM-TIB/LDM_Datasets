To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering percolation-like games with deep learning" by Michael M. Danziger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly focusing on the **Data Generation** subsection. This section typically contains detailed information about how datasets were created or sourced, including any parameters or configurations used during the data generation process. 

In this paper, the authors mention generating training and validation data by randomly initializing board states of size 20×20 with a fraction of blocked squares. This indicates that the dataset is synthetic and generated based on specific rules outlined in the paper.

I will also look for any **results** or **discussion** sections that might reference the performance of the models on these datasets or any comparisons made with existing datasets. This could provide additional context or validation for the datasets used.

After gathering all relevant information, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, since the dataset is synthetic and generated by the authors, I will note that there may not be a traditional citation, but I will document the methodology used to create the dataset.

The key points I will extract include:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The dataset is generated by initializing board states of size 20×20 with a fraction of blocked squares, as described in the Methods section.

2. **Data Generation Methodology**: The authors provide a detailed algorithm for generating the dataset, which I will summarize.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will focus on documenting the synthetic dataset creation process as the primary dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset details, including the methodology for its generation, ensuring that I provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
