To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Language Generation with Sentence Coherence Objective" by Ruixiao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the goal of improving coherence in language generation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the problem of coherence in generated text and references existing models like GPT-2 and BERT, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they used the **Wikipedia dataset** for training and fine-tuning their model. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.1, the authors describe how they train a coherence classification model using positive samples from the same paragraph and negative samples from the entire training set. However, they do not specify any additional datasets beyond the Wikipedia dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wikipedia dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Stephen Merity. *The wikitext long term dependency language modeling dataset*. Salesforce Metamind, 9, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Wikipedia dataset, I will document this dataset with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included as required. The only dataset extracted from this paper is the Wikipedia dataset, and I will ensure that it is clearly documented with the full citation.

This systematic approach allows me to accurately extract and cite the relevant datasets from the research paper.
