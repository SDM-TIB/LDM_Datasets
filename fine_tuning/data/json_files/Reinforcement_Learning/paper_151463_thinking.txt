To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exclusively Penalized Q-learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Junghyuk Yum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Exclusively Penalized Q-learning (EPQ), is evaluated on various offline control tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **D4RL benchmark** for their experiments, which is a collection of datasets for offline reinforcement learning. I will note down the specific tasks and datasets mentioned.

In **subsection 4.1 (Performance Comparisons)**, the authors describe several tasks and datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Mujoco Locomotion Tasks**: This includes datasets for HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d, with variations such as 'random', 'medium', 'expert', 'medium-expert', 'medium-replay', and 'full-replay'.

2. **Adroit Manipulation Tasks**: This section mentions four tasks (Pen, Hammer, Door, and Relocate) with two datasets each: 'human' (derived from motion-capture data) and 'cloned' (from both the cloned behavior policy and the original data).

3. **AntMaze Navigation Tasks**: The authors describe six navigation tasks (umaze, umaze-diverse, medium-play, medium-diverse, large-play, and large-diverse) with specific dataset characteristics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The D4RL benchmark is referenced, and I will ensure to include the citation for it:

- For the D4RL benchmark, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Next, I will compile the datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
