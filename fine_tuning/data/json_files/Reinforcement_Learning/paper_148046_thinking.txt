To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Empathic Deep Q-Learning" by Bart Bussmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of Empathic DQN in two gridworld environments, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used for experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets or environments used in their research. In this case, the authors mention two specific environments: the **Coexistence environment** and the **Sharing environment**. 

1. **Coexistence Environment**: This environment involves a robot and a cat, where the robot must navigate without harming the cat. The authors describe the setup and the dynamics of the environment, but they do not refer to a specific dataset. Instead, they create a simulated environment for their experiments.

2. **Sharing Environment**: This environment consists of a robot and a human, where the robot collects resources (batteries) while considering the human's needs. Similar to the Coexistence environment, this is also a simulated environment rather than a dataset derived from real-world data.

Since both environments are custom-designed for the experiments and do not correspond to publicly available datasets, I will note that there are no external datasets cited in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have captured any relevant citations that might pertain to the environments or methodologies used. However, since the environments are not derived from existing datasets, I will not find specific dataset citations here.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets; instead, it employs two custom-designed environments for its experiments: the Coexistence environment and the Sharing environment. 

I will document this information clearly, noting the absence of external datasets while providing a brief description of the environments used in the experiments.
