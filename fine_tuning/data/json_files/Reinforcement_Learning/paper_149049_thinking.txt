To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphSVX: Shapley Value Explanations for Graph Neural Networks" by Alexandre Duval and Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to identify the datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

In this particular paper, I expect to find datasets mentioned in the context of both synthetic and real-world experiments. For instance, the authors might describe datasets like "Cora" and "PubMed" for document classification tasks, or synthetic datasets like "BA-2motifs" and "MUTAG" for graph classification tasks.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements. This will involve formatting the citations correctly and ensuring that all relevant details are included, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and well-organized for any downstream processing or review.
