To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A pricing mechanism to jointly mitigate market power and environmental externalities in electricity markets" by Lamia Varawala et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in the research. The authors may discuss previous studies or datasets that inform their work, which could be relevant.

I will then focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the data collection process, including any datasets they used for their analysis. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors reference specific datasets when discussing their findings. They may provide insights into how the datasets were analyzed or the outcomes derived from them.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on this process, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include their full citations. If the paper mentions datasets like "Nordpool market data" or "European Environment Agency data," I will ensure to find the appropriate citations for these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, description, and citation, to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in this research paper.
