To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collision Avoidance Robotics Via Meta-Learning" by Aravind Mahadevan and Abhiram Iyer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions a 2D vehicle equipped with a LIDAR sensor, it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and references the Brain Corp robot motion planning environment, which may indicate the use of a specific dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup. In section IV, the authors describe their experimental setup for both MAML and TD3. They mention that they trained agents on the Brain Corp robot motion planning environment, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional context or references to datasets used in their experiments. However, it appears that the primary dataset referenced is the Brain Corp robot motion planning environment.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Brain Corp robot motion planning environment. The paper cites it as follows:

- **Brain Corp robot motion planning environment**: 
  > Brain Corp, “Brain motion planning environment,” 2019. Available at: https://github.com/braincorp/bc-gym-planning-env.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Brain Corp robot motion planning environment**: This environment is used for training agents equipped with LIDAR sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation for the Brain Corp robot motion planning environment, ensuring that it is clearly documented for future reference.
