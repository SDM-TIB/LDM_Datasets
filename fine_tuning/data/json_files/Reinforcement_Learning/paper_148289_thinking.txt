To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Counterfactual Treatment Outcomes Over Time Through Adversarially Balanced Representations" by Ioana Bica et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a simulated model of tumor growth, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this model.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss leveraging observational data, such as electronic health records, which indicates that they may have used real-world datasets in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and validation. The authors describe evaluating their model on a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of tumor growth, which implies that they have generated or utilized a dataset for this purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Simulated Tumor Growth Dataset**: This dataset is generated using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to simulate the combined effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in lung cancer patients. The authors mention that they used this dataset to evaluate their model's performance in predicting counterfactual outcomes.

2. **MIMIC-III Database**: The authors also utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database, which consists of electronic health records from ICU patients. They extracted patient data related to antibiotic administration and white blood cell counts to assess the effectiveness of treatments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **Simulated Tumor Growth Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geng, C., Paganetti, H., & Grassberger, C. (2017). *Prediction of treatment response for combined chemo-and radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients using a bio-mathematical model*. Scientific Reports, 7(1), 13542.

- For the **MIMIC-III Database**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-wei, H. L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3, 160035.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately documented with its full citation.
