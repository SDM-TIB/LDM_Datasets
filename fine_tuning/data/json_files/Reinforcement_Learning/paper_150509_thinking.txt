To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FLCC: Efficient Distributed Federated Learning on IoMT over CSMA/CA" by Abdelaziz Salama et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions benchmarking the proposed approach using the **MNIST dataset** for performance evaluation. This indicates that a dataset is explicitly referenced, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for any additional mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the use of IoMT devices and their applications, but the specific dataset is not elaborated upon further. 

In the **simulation results and discussion** section, the authors provide more context about the **MNIST dataset**, stating that it contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits and that each node within the network is assigned random samples in the range of 100-200 for training and validation using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). This confirms the dataset's relevance and application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically standardized. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
