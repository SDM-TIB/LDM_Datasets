To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAS-LID: Efficient Neural Architecture Search with Local Intrinsic Dimension" by Xin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on NASBench-201," which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, the authors discuss their experiments and mention the datasets they utilized. I will pay close attention to any descriptions or characteristics of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **NASBench-201** dataset. They describe it as a public tabular architecture dataset that builds a DARTS-like search space and provides the performance of 15,625 neural architectures on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. This is a crucial detail that confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NASBench-201 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

Additionally, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. I will also look for their citations in the references. The citations for these datasets are:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **NASBench-201**: A public tabular architecture dataset providing performance metrics for neural architectures.
   - Citation: Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset used for image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Another dataset used for image classification tasks, similar to CIFAR-10.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
