To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Urban Driving by Imitating a Reinforcement Learning Coach" by Zhejun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a reinforcement learning expert called Roach, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the training and evaluation of this model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **CARLA simulator** as the environment for their experiments. They also refer to the **NoCrash benchmark** and the **LeaderBoard benchmark** for evaluating their methods. I will need to confirm if these benchmarks are associated with specific datasets or if they are simply evaluation protocols.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to the CARLA simulator, I will find the original paper that describes it. The citation for CARLA is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 1–16.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of public driving datasets or specific datasets used for training the RL agent. If the authors reference datasets like **nuScenes** or **BDD100K**, I will ensure to extract their citations as well.

For example, if the paper mentions the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation would be:
> Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., ... & Beijbom, O. (2019). nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for each one. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
