To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for General Game Playing with Ludii and Polygames" by Dennis J. N. J. Soemers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of Ludii and Polygames for training models in various games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention that they trained models on **fifteen different games** implemented in Ludii. I will look for specific names of these games, as they may serve as datasets for the experiments.

In the **table presented in section 5**, the authors list the games along with their properties, trainable parameters, and win percentages. The games mentioned include:

1. **Breakthrough**
2. **Connect6**
3. **Dai Hasami Shogi**
4. **Fanorona**
5. **Feed the Ducks**
6. **Gomoku**
7. **Hex**
8. **HeXentaﬂ**
9. **Konane**
10. **Lasca**
11. **Minishogi**
12. **Pentalath**
13. **Squava**
14. **Surakarta**
15. **Yavalath**

Each of these games represents a dataset used for training the models in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets associated with these games. However, since these games are implemented in the Ludii system, they may not have traditional citations like datasets from academic papers. Instead, I will cite the Ludii system itself as the source of these datasets.

The citation for the Ludii system is:
> Piette, É., Soemers, D. J. N. J., Stephenson, M., Sironi, C. F., Winands, M. H. M., & Browne, C. (2020). Ludii – the ludemic general game system. In G. D. Giacomo, A. Catala, B. Dilkina, M. Milano, S. Barro, A. Bugarín, & J. Lang (Eds.), Proceedings of the 24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2020) (Vol. 325, pp. 411–418). IOS Press.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Ludii system as the source of the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
