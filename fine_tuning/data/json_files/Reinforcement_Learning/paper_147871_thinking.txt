To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infeasibility and structural bias in Differential Evolution" by Fabio Caraffini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup, including any datasets used for testing the algorithms. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various configurations of Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms and their performance on optimization problems. They mention using a specific function for testing, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly referenced. If they are, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like "CEC 2014 Benchmark Functions," I would look for the citation that describes this dataset in detail, including the authors, title, and publication details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any required output format or further processing.
