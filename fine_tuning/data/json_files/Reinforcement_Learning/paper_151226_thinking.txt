To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Estimation Bias in Deep Double Q-Learning" by Alberto Sinigaglia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **Mujoco robotics environments** from the **OpenAI Gym suite** for their experiments. This indicates that they are using a well-known set of environments for testing their algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Mujoco environments are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the original citation for Mujoco and OpenAI Gym.

The citation for Mujoco is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In *2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems* (pp. 5026â€“5033). doi:10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
