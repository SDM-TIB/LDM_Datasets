To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Synthetic Environments for Reinforcement Learning with Evolution Strategies" by Fabio Ferreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic environments (SEs) for reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the concept of learning proxy data generating processes for reinforcement learning but still lacks specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **method** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **method** section, the authors describe the target tasks as **CartPole-v0** and **Acrobot-v1**, which are standard environments from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments** section, the authors mention that they conducted evaluations on these two tasks, confirming their use as datasets. However, I need to ensure I have the full citations for these environments.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets:

1. **CartPole-v0**: The citation for this environment is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Acrobot-v1**: This environment is also part of the OpenAI Gym, so it shares the same citation as CartPole-v0.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CartPole-v0**: OpenAI Gym environment for reinforcement learning.
- **Acrobot-v1**: Another OpenAI Gym environment for reinforcement learning.

Both datasets are cited from the same source, which is the OpenAI Gym paper. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
