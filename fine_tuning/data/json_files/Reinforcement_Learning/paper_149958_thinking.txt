To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is Healthy? Generative Counterfactual Diffusion for Lesion Localization" by Pedro Sanchez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generative diffusion models for lesion localization, which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention evaluating lesion localization performance using data from the **BraTS 2021 challenge**. This indicates that the BraTS dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it comprises magnetic resonance (MR) imaging from four sequences: T1, post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). They also mention the number of patients involved in the dataset splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the BraTS 2021 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **BraTS 2021 challenge**, the citation is:
  > Bakas, S., Reyes, M., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Rempï¬‚er, M., Crimi, A., Shinohara, R.T., Berger, C., Ha, S.M., Rozycki, M., et al. "Identifying the best machine learning algorithms for brain tumor segmentation, progression assessment, and overall survival prediction in the BraTS challenge." arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.02629 (2018).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the BraTS 2021 challenge, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
