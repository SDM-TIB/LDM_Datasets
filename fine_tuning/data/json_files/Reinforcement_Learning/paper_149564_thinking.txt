To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fair Node Representations with Graph Counterfactual Fairness" by Jing Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly the **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant statistics that characterize these datasets.

From my reading of section 4.1, I find that the authors used three datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated based on a causal model, allowing for full manipulation of the data generation process. The authors describe how the features, latent embeddings, graph structure, and labels are created.

2. **Bail Dataset**: This dataset contains data on defendants released on bail in U.S. state courts. Each node represents a defendant, and edges represent similarities in criminal records and demographics. The sensitive attribute used is race, and the task is to classify defendants regarding their likelihood of committing a violent crime if released.

3. **Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes individuals' default payment information, where each node represents an individual and edges represent similarities in spending and payment patterns. The sensitive attribute is age, and the task is to predict whether an individual will default on credit card payments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Bail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Agarwal, C., Lakkaraju, H., & Zitnik, M. (2021). Towards a Unified Framework for Fair and Stable Graph Representation Learning. UAI (2021).

- For the **Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Agarwal, C., Zitnik, M., & Lakkaraju, H. (2021). Towards a Rigorous Theoretical Analysis and Evaluation of GNN Explanations. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09078 (2021).

The **Synthetic Dataset** does not have a specific citation since it is generated by the authors based on their own causal model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
