To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FLASH-RL: Federated Learning Addressing System and Static Heterogeneity using Reinforcement Learning" by Sofiane Bouaziz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained on **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **MobiAct** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experimental methodology** section, specifically focusing on the **dataset description** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits used for image classification tasks, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset includes 60,000 colored images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

3. **MobiAct**: This dataset is designed for activity recognition and fall detection, comprising data collected from 67 volunteers during various activities, including falls.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **MobiAct**, the citation is:
  > G. Vavoulas, C. Chatzaki, T. Malliotakis, M. Pediaditis, and M. Tsiknakis. *The MobiAct Dataset: Recognition of Activities of Daily Living Using Smartphones*. In ICT4AgeingWell, 2016.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for future reference.
