To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Type-2 Fuzzy Reliability-Redundancy Allocation Problem and its Solution Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm" by Zubair Ashraf et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experimental simulations were performed on various numerical datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the need for reliable systems and the importance of datasets in evaluating their proposed methods. However, I need to find the exact names and details of the datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Pharmaceutical Plant Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the series-parallel FMORRAP formulation, and it includes shaping factors, scaling factors, component weights, and volumes for various sub-systems.

2. **Input Dataset from Mutingi (2014)**: This dataset is used for the parallel-series FMORRAP formulation and includes similar parameters as the pharmaceutical dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Pharmaceutical Plant Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garg H, Sharma SP. "Multi-objective reliability-redundancy allocation problem using particle swarm optimization." *Computers & Industrial Engineering*, 64:247-255, 2013. doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2012.09.015.

- For the **Input Dataset from Mutingi (2014)**, the citation is:
  > Mutingi M. "System reliability optimization: A fuzzy multi-objective genetic algorithm approach." *Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc - Reliability and Safety*, 16:400-406, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
