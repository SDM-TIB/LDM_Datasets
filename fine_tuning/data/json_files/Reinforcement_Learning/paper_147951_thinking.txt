To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Manifolds: A non-linear analogue to Active Subspaces" by Robert A. Bridges et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this section, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the paper, the authors mention two main datasets related to their experiments:

1. **Two-dimensional test functions**: The authors describe three specific functions used for testing their method:
   - \( f_1(x, y) = e^{y - x^2} \)
   - \( f_2(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \)
   - \( f_3(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 0.2x + 0.6y \)

2. **Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generator model**: The authors reference a dataset used for sensitivity analysis, which is based on the work of Glaws et al. (2017). They describe the parameters and ranges used in their experiments, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the MHD power generator model, I will look for the original paper by Glaws et al. (2017) to provide an accurate citation.

The citation for the MHD power generator model is:
> Glaws, A., et al. "Dimension reduction in magnetohydrodynamics power generation models: Dimensional analysis and active subspaces." *SADM: ASA Data Sci. J.*, 10(5):312â€“325, 2017.

For the two-dimensional test functions, since they are mathematical functions rather than datasets from a specific source, I will note that they are commonly used in literature for testing purposes but do not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
