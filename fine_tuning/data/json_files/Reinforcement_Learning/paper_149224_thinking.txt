To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MarsExplorer: Exploration of Unknown Terrains via Deep Reinforcement Learning and Procedurally Generated Environments" by Dimitrios I. Koutras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the MarsExplorer environment but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** where the authors discuss the evaluation of various reinforcement learning algorithms. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and testing the algorithms.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not reference any external datasets but rather describe the MarsExplorer environment itself as a procedurally generated environment for reinforcement learning. This means that the dataset is essentially the data generated by the MarsExplorer environment during the experiments.

Since there are no external datasets cited, I will document the MarsExplorer environment as the primary dataset used in the experiments. I will also need to provide a full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Dimitrios I. Koutras, Athanasios Ch. Kapoutsis, Angelos A. Amanatiadis, Elias B. Kosmatopoulos. *MarsExplorer: Exploration of Unknown Terrains via Deep Reinforcement Learning and Procedurally Generated Environments*. Preprint. Under review.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: MarsExplorer Environment
   - **Description**: An openai-gym compatible environment designed for exploration and coverage of unknown terrains using reinforcement learning. The environment generates procedural terrains for training and evaluation.
   - **Citation**: Dimitrios I. Koutras, Athanasios Ch. Kapoutsis, Angelos A. Amanatiadis, Elias B. Kosmatopoulos. *MarsExplorer: Exploration of Unknown Terrains via Deep Reinforcement Learning and Procedurally Generated Environments*. Preprint. Under review.

With this information compiled, I am ready to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
