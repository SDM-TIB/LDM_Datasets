To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Strategies to Perform Multilingual Analysis of Social Content for a Novel Dataset in the Tourism Domain" by Maxime Masson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a "newly collected and annotated multilingual dataset composed of tourism-related tweets," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Building and Annotation)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **27,379 tweets**, with **2,961 tweets** selected for annotation. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition, including the languages involved (French, English, and Spanish) and the specific tasks for which the data has been annotated (Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, and Fine-Grained Thematic Concept Extraction).

In this section, the authors also discuss the methodology used for collecting and annotating the dataset, which includes using the Twitter Academic API and a novel iterative filtering process. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or resources mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **WTO Thesaurus of Tourism and Leisure Activities** as a resource for thematic concept extraction, which is important for understanding the dataset's annotation framework.

The citation for the WTO Thesaurus is:
> World Tourism Organization. *Thesaurus on tourism and leisure activities*. World Tourism Organization, Madrid, Spain, 2002.

Additionally, the authors mention existing annotated resources in **section 2.3**, such as the **ESTER corpus** and **AnCora**, which could be relevant for comparative analysis. Here are their citations:

- For the **ESTER corpus**:
  > Galliano, S., Geoffrois, E., Gravier, G., Bonastre, J.-F., Mostefa, D., Choukri, K. *Corpus description of the ester evaluation campaign for the rich transcription of french broadcast news*. In LREC, 2006, pp. 139–142.

- For **AnCora**:
  > Taulé, M., Martí, M. A., Recasens, M. *Ancora: Multilevel annotated corpora for catalan and spanish*. In Lrec, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their authoritative references.
