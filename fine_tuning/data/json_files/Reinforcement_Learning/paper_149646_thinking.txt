To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Hierarchy Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Wei Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they refer to several tasks, including a large-scale autonomous driving task in the **CARLA simulator**. This indicates that the CARLA simulator is a dataset or environment used for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to see if any datasets are cited or discussed in detail. The authors mention the CARLA simulator, which is a well-known dataset for autonomous driving tasks. I will ensure to find the full citation for this dataset.

In the **references section**, I will look for the citation of the CARLA simulator. The relevant citation is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to benchmark tasks such as **GOALNAV**, **JCTNAV**, and **TAXI**. These are likely specific tasks rather than datasets, but I will verify if they reference any underlying datasets or if they are derived from existing datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the identified datasets and their full citations into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Check the references for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
4. Document the findings clearly, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
