To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitation Game: A Model-based and Imitation Learning Deep Reinforcement Learning Hybrid" by Eric MSP Veith et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset mentions.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or case studies. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors may describe their case study involving the CIGRÉ Medium Voltage benchmark grid. I will pay close attention to any details regarding this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the research.

In the **case study section**, I will look for specific details about the CIGRÉ Medium Voltage benchmark grid. This section should provide insights into the dataset's structure, size, and any relevant parameters that were used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the ability to locate the datasets.

For the CIGRÉ Medium Voltage benchmark grid, I will look for the following citation:
- CIGRÉ. *CIGRÉ Medium Voltage Benchmark Grid*. [Online]. Available: [CIGRÉ website or relevant publication link].

If the paper references any other datasets, I will ensure to extract their names and citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future research or applications.
