To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment" by Karol Kurach et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the Google Research Football Environment, indicating that it is a new reinforcement learning environment, but it does not specify datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the need for challenging environments in reinforcement learning but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and experimental setup sections** to look for any datasets used in their experiments.

In the **Football Benchmarks section**, the authors describe benchmark tasks but do not refer to external datasets. Instead, they mention the Football Engine and the Football Academy, which are components of their environment rather than datasets. 

I will also check the **experimental results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. However, it appears that the paper focuses on the environment itself and the benchmarks created within it, rather than utilizing external datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The paper does not mention any specific datasets from external sources, as it primarily discusses the Football Environment and its components.

Since the paper does not provide any external datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. The focus is on the development of a new environment for reinforcement learning rather than on utilizing existing datasets.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets that require citation, as it primarily introduces a novel environment for reinforcement learning without referencing external datasets.
