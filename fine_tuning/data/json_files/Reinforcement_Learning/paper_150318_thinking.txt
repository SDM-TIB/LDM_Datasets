To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Neural Architecture Search for Temporal Convolutional Networks at the Edge" by Matteo Risso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmarks)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four benchmarks:

1. **PPG-based Heart-Rate Monitoring**: The dataset used is the **PPG-Dalia dataset**. I will note that this dataset is used for regression tasks related to heart rate monitoring.

2. **ECG-based Arrhythmia Detection**: The authors mention the **ECG5000 dataset**, which is used for classifying ECG signals into five classes.

3. **sEMG-based Hand-Gesture Recognition**: The dataset referenced here is the **NinaPro DB1 dataset**, which includes various gesture classes for recognition tasks.

4. **Keyword Spotting**: The dataset used for this task is the **Speech Commands v2 dataset**, which is designed for limited-vocabulary speech recognition.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **PPG-Dalia dataset**:
  > A. Reiss et al., “Deep PPG: Large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks,” Sensors, vol. 19, no. 14, p. 3079, 2019.

- For the **ECG5000 dataset**:
  > Y. Chen et al., “A general framework for never-ending learning from time series streams,” Data Min. Knowl. Discov., vol. 29, no. 6, pp. 1622–1664, 2015.

- For the **NinaPro DB1 dataset**:
  > M. Atzori et al., “Building the NinaPro database: A resource for the biorobotics community,” in Proc. 4th IEEE RAS & EMBS BioRob, 2012, pp. 1258–1265.

- For the **Speech Commands v2 dataset**:
  > P. Warden, “Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
