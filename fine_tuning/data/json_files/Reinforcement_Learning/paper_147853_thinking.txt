To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sharing Behaviors with Arbitrary Numbers of Agents" by Katherine Metcalf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a method for modeling turn-taking behaviors in a multi-agent environment, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for validation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups. 

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors describe a **tower-building environment** where their models are tested. However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or specific datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they describe the setup and the types of agents involved in the experiments.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. I will look for any references that might pertain to datasets used in similar experiments or methodologies.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works related to multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning, but none of these references point to specific datasets. 

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. 

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.**
2. **No references to datasets were found in the references section.**

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all sections of a research paper, especially the experiments and references, to identify datasets. In this case, the absence of datasets means I will not be able to provide any citations.
