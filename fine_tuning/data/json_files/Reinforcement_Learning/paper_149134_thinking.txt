To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Practical Credit Assignment for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Vyacheslav Alipov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed methods on the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** benchmark, which suggests that this could be a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will specifically look for any mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors indeed mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as their benchmark for evaluating the performance of their proposed algorithms. They state that they tested their methods on a broad swathe of **32 ALE games**, which indicates that the ALE serves as a collection of datasets for various games.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The citation for ALE is as follows:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2012). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279. doi: 10.1613/jair.3912. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from ALE, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A benchmark consisting of multiple games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for ALE, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
