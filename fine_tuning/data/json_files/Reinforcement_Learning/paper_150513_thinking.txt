To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA-BSP: a simulated dataset with pedestrians" by Maciej Wielgosz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a sample dataset featuring pedestrians generated using the ARCANE framework, which indicates that a specific dataset is being introduced. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and its applications in pedestrian detection, autoencoding, pose estimation, and pose lifting.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the dataset in detail. In this paper, the dataset is described in **section 3 (Binary Single Pedestrian dataset)**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its structure, the number of scenes, frames, and the types of annotations available.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **Binary Single Pedestrian dataset**: This dataset contains almost 400 scenes, with each clip recorded for 900 frames at 30 fps, yielding 30 seconds of video. It is specifically designed for binary classification tasks where the pedestrian is either crossing or non-crossing. The dataset includes annotations in CSV format, detailing various attributes such as pedestrian age, gender, and pose keypoints.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin:

- For the CARLA simulator, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio López, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

Since the dataset is generated using the CARLA simulator, this citation is relevant for the dataset itself.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and its citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its authoritative citation.
