To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A GA-like Dynamic Probability Method With Mutual Information for Feature Selection" by Gaoshuai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **15 datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental results and analysis)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the characteristics of the datasets, including the number of instances, features, and classes. This table is crucial as it provides a concise overview of each dataset.

In Table 1, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **PCMAC**: 1943 instances, 3289 features, 2 classes.
2. **Isolet**: 1560 instances, 617 features, 26 classes.
3. **GLIOMA**: 50 instances, 4434 features, 4 classes.
4. **Prostate GE**: 102 instances, 5966 features, 2 classes.
5. **RELATHE**: 1427 instances, 4322 features, 2 classes.
6. **TOX 171**: 171 instances, 5748 features, 4 classes.
7. **USPS**: 9298 instances, 256 features, 10 classes.
8. **CNAE-9**: 1079 instances, 855 features, 9 classes.
9. **lung discrete**: 73 instances, 325 features, 7 classes.
10. **warpPIE10P**: 210 instances, 2420 features, 10 classes.
11. **lung**: 203 instances, 3312 features, 5 classes.
12. **COIL20**: 1440 instances, 1024 features, 20 classes.
13. **warpAR10P**: 130 instances, 2400 features, 10 classes.
14. **Yale**: 165 instances, 1024 features, 15 classes.
15. **Brain Tumor 1**: 90 instances, 5920 features, 5 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly. Therefore, I will need to look up the datasets individually to find their authoritative sources.

For example, I can find the following citations:

- **PCMAC**:

- **Yale**: 
  > "Yale Dataset." Available at [source].

- **Brain Tumor 1**:

After gathering the necessary citations, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
