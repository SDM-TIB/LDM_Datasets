To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QPLEX: Duplex Dueling Multi-Agent Q-Learning" by Jianhao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from the **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, which is a well-known benchmark for evaluating multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. I will note the specific tasks or scenarios from SMAC that were used as datasets.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or datasets that may not have been included in the main text. This is often where supplementary information is provided.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For the **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge**, I will reference the original paper that introduced this benchmark:

- For the **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge**, the citation is:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems, pp. 2186â€“2188, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
