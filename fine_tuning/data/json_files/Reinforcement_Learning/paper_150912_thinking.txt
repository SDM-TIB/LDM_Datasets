To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solution to Advanced Manufacturing Process Problems using Cohort Intelligence Algorithm with Improved Constraint Handling Approaches" by Aniket Nargundkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work. This section often contains background information that may lead to the identification of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed algorithms. This section is crucial as it often outlines the specific datasets employed in the study.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. This may include comparisons with other algorithms or benchmarks, which can help confirm the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. It is important to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using datasets related to advanced manufacturing processes, I will look for the original sources of these datasets and note their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
