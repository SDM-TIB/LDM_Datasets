To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hindsight Network Credit Assignment" by Kenny Young, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on a contextual bandit version of MNIST, which suggests that the MNIST dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate HNCA on the **MNIST dataset**. This confirms that MNIST is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will then look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. (2010). Mnist handwritten digit database. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information accordingly.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method in a contextual bandit setting. It consists of handwritten digit images and is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation included, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
