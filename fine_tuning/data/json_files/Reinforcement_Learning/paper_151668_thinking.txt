To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In Search for Architectures and Loss Functions in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning" by Mikhail Terekhov and Caglar Gulcehre, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on several environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting evaluations on the **MORL Deep Sea Treasure**, **Minecart**, and **Reacher environments**. These environments are likely to be the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of these environments. The authors provide insights into how these environments are structured and what specific data they contain. For example, the **Deep Sea Treasure** environment involves a submarine navigating a grid with two objectives: fuel cost and treasure reward. The **Minecart** environment has multiple rewards based on ore collection and fuel consumption, while the **Reacher** environment involves controlling a robotic arm with specific targets.

After identifying these environments, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but will refer to the original papers or sources that describe these environments.

1. **Deep Sea Treasure**: The citation is:
   > Alegre, L. N., Felten, F., Talbi, E.-G., Danoy, G., Nowé, A., Bazzan, A. L. C., & da Silva, B. C. (2022). MO-Gym: A library of multi-objective reinforcement learning environments. In Proceedings of the 34th Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence BNAIC/Benelearn 2022.

2. **Minecart**: The citation is also from the same source as above, as it is part of the MO-Gym library.

3. **Reacher**: This environment is based on the MuJoCo physics engine, and the citation is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, T. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026–5033. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
