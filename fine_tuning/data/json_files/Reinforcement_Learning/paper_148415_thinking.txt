To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSAC: Distributional Soft Actor Critic for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning" by Xiaoteng Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on several continuous control benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments using **MuJoCo** and **Box2d** environments, which are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **background section (Section 2)** to see if there are any references to specific datasets or environments that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. The authors mention the use of **OpenAI Gym**, which provides a suite of environments for testing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **MuJoCo**: 
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, 2012.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: 
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

3. **Box2d**: This is typically included within the OpenAI Gym framework, so it may not have a separate citation. However, it is often referenced in conjunction with OpenAI Gym.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
