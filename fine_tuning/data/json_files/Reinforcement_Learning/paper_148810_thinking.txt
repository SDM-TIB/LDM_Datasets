To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selective Pseudo-Labeling with Reinforcement Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation" by Bingyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **DomainNet**: A large-scale domain adaptation benchmark dataset containing six domains and 345 classes. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed method.

2. **Office-31**: A widely used dataset for visual domain adaptation, consisting of 31 categories collected from three different domains: Amazon (A), Webcam (W), and DSLR (D).

3. **Office-Home**: Another domain adaptation dataset that includes four distinct domains: Artistic images (A), Clipart (C), Product images (P), and Real-World images (R). This dataset is noted to be more challenging than Office-31.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **Office-31**, the citation is:
  > Saenko, K., Kulis, B., Fritz, M., & Darrell, T. (2010). Adapting visual category models to new domains. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **Office-Home**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
