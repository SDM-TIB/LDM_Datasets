To extract datasets from the research paper titled "META-Learning Eligibility Traces for More Sample Efficient Temporal Difference Learning" by Mingde Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental studies section** (Chapter 5), as this is where datasets are most likely to be detailed. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experimental sections, I will pay attention to any references to environments or datasets used in the experiments, such as "RingWorld," "FrozenLake," and "MountainCar." I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their structure, purpose, and any relevant statistics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "RingWorld" dataset, I will look for its original source or any relevant papers that describe it. Similarly, I will do the same for "FrozenLake" and "MountainCar," ensuring that I capture the full citation for each.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
