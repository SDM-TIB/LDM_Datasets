To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cal-QL: Calibrated Offline RL Pre-Training for Efficient Online Fine-Tuning" by Mitsuhiko Nakamoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several specific tasks and datasets in the context of their experiments. 

1. **D4RL Benchmark Tasks**: The authors state that they evaluate Cal-QL on a variety of benchmark tasks from D4RL, which is a significant indicator that multiple datasets are involved. 

2. **AntMaze Tasks**: The paper describes the AntMaze tasks, which require controlling a quadruped robot. The datasets used include:
   - **antmaze-large-diverse-v2**
   - **antmaze-large-play-v2**
   - **antmaze-medium-diverse-v2**
   - **antmaze-medium-play-v2**

3. **Franka Kitchen Tasks**: The authors also mention the Franka Kitchen domain, which involves controlling a robot to achieve specific configurations. The datasets used here are:
   - **kitchen-complete**
   - **kitchen-partial**
   - **kitchen-mixed**

4. **Adroit Dexterous Manipulation Tasks**: The paper discusses three tasks in the Adroit domain, which involve a dexterous manipulation robot. The datasets for these tasks are:
   - **pen-binary-v0**
   - **door-binary-v0**
   - **relocate-binary-v0**

5. **Visual Manipulation Domain**: The authors mention a pick-and-place task that involves visual manipulation, which is another dataset used in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the D4RL benchmark tasks and other datasets are typically included in the references, which provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation for future reference.
