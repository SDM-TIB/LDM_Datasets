To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Well Do Feature-Additive Explainers Explain Feature-Additive Predictors?" by Zachariah Carmichael and Walter J. Scheirer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating explainers on "thousands of synthetic and several real-world tasks," which suggests that both synthetic and real-world datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: This dataset contains median home values in Boston, MA, predicted by various covariates, including sensitive attributes related to race.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset, collected by ProPublica, includes covariates such as criminal history and demographics, along with the proprietary COMPAS risk score and recidivism data for defendants from Broward County, Florida.

3. **FICO HELOC Dataset**: This dataset consists of anonymous HELOC applications made by consumers requesting a credit line, with the task being to predict repayment ability within two years.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: A down-sampled version of the MNIST dataset is used, which includes handwritten digits resized for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Boston Housing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Harrison, Jr. and Daniel L Rubinfeld. *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1):81–102, March 1978.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, and Lauren Kirchner. *Machine bias: there’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks*. ProPublica, 2016. Available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

- For the **FICO HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). *FICO explainable machine learning challenge: Home equity line of credit (HELOC) dataset*. Available at: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
