To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Inverse Q-learning with Constraints" by Gabriel Kalweit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors refer to the **Objectworld benchmark** and the **SUMO simulator** for their experiments, indicating that these are likely datasets or environments used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors describe their evaluation on the **Objectworld benchmark** and the **SUMO simulator**. I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

For the **Objectworld benchmark**, I will check the references section to find the original source or citation for this dataset. The paper mentions that the Objectworld environment is based on a specific setup, and I will look for the original paper that describes this benchmark.

For the **SUMO simulator**, I will also look for its citation in the references section. The authors mention using the SUMO simulator for autonomous lane-change tasks, which indicates that it is a significant part of their evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Objectworld Benchmark**: The citation for the Objectworld benchmark is:
   > Sergey Levine, Zoran Popovic, and Vladlen Koltun. *Nonlinear inverse reinforcement learning with gaussian processes*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 24, pages 19â€“27. Curran Associates, Inc., 2011.

2. **SUMO Simulator**: The citation for the SUMO simulator is:
   > Daniel Krajzewicz, Jakob Erdmann, Michael Behrisch, and Laura Bieker-Walz. *Recent development and applications of SUMO - simulation of urban mobility*. International Journal On Advances in Systems and Measurements, 3 and 4, 12 2012.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and provide proper credit to the original sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included.
