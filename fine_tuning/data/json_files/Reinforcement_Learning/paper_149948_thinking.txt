To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAD for Robust Reinforcement Learning in Machine Translation" by Domenic Donato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a variety of translation tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they run their model on a total of **9 dataset–language direction translation tasks**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

I will then look for a **table or a list** within this section that details the datasets. In the paper, there is a reference to **Appendix C**, which provides a detailed description of the datasets, preprocessing, and tokenization. I will check this appendix to find the specific datasets used.

Upon reviewing Appendix C, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **IWSLT’14**: This dataset is used for English ↔ German translation tasks.
2. **WMT’14**: This dataset is used for English ↔ German news translation tasks.
3. **WMT’20**: This dataset includes multiple language pairs, specifically Pashto ↔ English and Chinese ↔ English.
4. **NIST**: This dataset is used for the Chinese → English translation task.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly known datasets in the machine translation community. Therefore, I will provide the standard references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- **IWSLT’14**:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2014). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT).

- **WMT’14**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

- **WMT’20**:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2020). *Findings of the 2020 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT20)*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation.

- **NIST**:
  > NIST (2006). *The NIST Open MT Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
