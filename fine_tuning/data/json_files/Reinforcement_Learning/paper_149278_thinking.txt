To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReGen: Reinforcement Learning for Text and Knowledge Base Generation using Pretrained Language Models" by Pierre L. Dognin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **WebNLG+ 2020** and **TEKGEN** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. In **Section 4.1**, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **WebNLG+ 2020**: This dataset is used for both graph-to-text (G2T) and text-to-graph (T2G) tasks. The authors describe it as containing RDF-encoded graphs associated with lexicalizations of sentences. They specify the dataset's structure, including the number of samples for training, validation, and testing.

2. **TEKGEN**: The authors describe this dataset as a large-scale test bed for G2T and T2G tasks, curated using Wikipedia and Wikidata. They mention that they processed the dataset to create subject, object, and relation boundaries, which enhances its usability for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WebNLG+ 2020**, the citation is:
  > Thiago Castro Ferreira, Claire Gardent, Nikolai Ilinykh, Chris van der Lee, Simon Mille, Diego Moussallem, and Anastasia Shimorina. *The 2020 bilingual, bi-directional WebNLG+ shared task: Overview and evaluation results (WebNLG+ 2020)*. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Natural Language Generation from the Semantic Web (WebNLG+), pages 55â€“76, Dublin, Ireland (Virtual), 2020.

- For **TEKGEN**, the citation is:
  > Oshin Agarwal, Heming Ge, Siamak Shakeri, and Rami Al-Rfou. *Knowledge graph based synthetic corpus generation for knowledge-enhanced language model pre-training*. 2021.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
