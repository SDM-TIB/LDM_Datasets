To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration with Unreliable Intrinsic Reward in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Wendelin BÃ¶hmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses intrinsic rewards and their impact on multi-agent reinforcement learning, but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are described. In this section, the authors mention extending a common partially observable predator-prey task in a grid-world. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name; instead, they describe the experimental setup and the nature of the task.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or benchmarks, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers related to reinforcement learning and exploration strategies, but again, they do not specify any datasets.

Given that the paper focuses on a custom experimental setup rather than established datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note the experimental setup as a potential dataset for future reference.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Predator-Prey Task**: A custom experimental setup described in the paper, which involves 4 agents in a grid-world environment. While not a formal dataset, it is a significant part of the research.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to extract, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none mentioned in the paper. Instead, I will summarize the experimental setup as a noteworthy aspect of the research.

Overall, this paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather describes a unique experimental framework that could be of interest for future studies in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
