To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalised Discount Functions applied to a Monte-Carlo AIÂµ Implementation" by Sean Lamont et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experimentation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using the AIXIjs platform, which is designed for simulating general reinforcement learning agents. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets that are commonly used in the field. Instead, they focus on the implementation of their own environment and the parameters used for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or related studies are cited that might include datasets relevant to their research. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of theoretical works and previous studies on reinforcement learning and discount functions, rather than specific datasets.

Given that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings accordingly. I will note that while the authors discuss their experimental setup and the AIXIjs platform, they do not provide citations for any datasets, as their work is more focused on theoretical contributions and the implementation of their own simulation environment.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings into a structured format, indicating that no external datasets were referenced in this paper, and provide a brief overview of the experimental setup described by the authors.
