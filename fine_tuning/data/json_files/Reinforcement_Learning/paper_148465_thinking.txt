To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Update Mechanism for Q-Networks Based On Extreme Learning Machines" by Callum Wilson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their new algorithm, Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM), to a standard Q-Network on the cart-pole task, which suggests that there may be datasets or environments involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any specific datasets or environments used in the evaluation of the proposed method. In this case, the authors explicitly mention using the **OpenAI Gym** environment for testing their algorithms, specifically the **CartPole-v0** environment.

I will then look for a detailed description of the CartPole-v0 environment within the paper. The authors describe it as a classical control problem where the goal is to keep a pole balanced on a cart, and they provide some details about the state and action spaces involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym and the CartPole-v0 environment. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, John Schneider, John Schulman, John Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

Additionally, the original formulation of the cart-pole problem is attributed to:

- **Cart-Pole Problem**: 
  > David Michie and R. A. Chambers. *BOXES: An Experiment in Adaptive Control*. Machine Intelligence, vol. 2, pp. 137â€“152, 1968.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the OpenAI Gym and the original cart-pole problem formulation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
