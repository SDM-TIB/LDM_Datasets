To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Concept Mapping: The Emergence of Human Abilities in Artificial Neural Networks When Learning Embodied and Self-Supervised" by Viviane Clay et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the experimental setup and the data used for training their models. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Obstacle Tower environment** for training their artificial neural networks. I will note this as a dataset since it is a specific environment used for their experiments.

I will also check the **supplementary material** for any additional datasets or data sources that may not have been included in the main text. The supplementary material often contains valuable details about the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Obstacle Tower environment**, the citation is:
> Arthur Juliani, Ahmed Khalifa, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Jonathan Harper, Ervin Teng, Hunter Henry, Adam Crespi, Julian Togelius, and Danny Lange. *Obstacle Tower: A Generalization Challenge in Vision, Control, and Planning*. February 2019.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations. I will then prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
