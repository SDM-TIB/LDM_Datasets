To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Throughput maximization of an IRS-assisted wireless powered network with interference: A deep unsupervised learning approach" by Ahsan Mehmood et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors describe the datasets used for their numerical examples or simulations. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were used to validate the proposed methods or algorithms. This may include performance metrics or comparisons against existing datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this specific paper, I will focus on the following potential datasets:

1. **Simulation Data**: The authors mention using numerical examples to validate their approach. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or parameters used for these simulations.

2. **Benchmark Datasets**: If the authors compare their results against existing methods, they may reference benchmark datasets. I will look for any such mentions.

3. **Custom Datasets**: If the authors created their own datasets for the study, I will look for details on how these datasets were generated and their characteristics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For any simulation data or custom datasets, I will note the details provided in the paper, including the methodology for generating or collecting the data.

- For benchmark datasets, I will extract the full citation from the references section, ensuring that I include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
