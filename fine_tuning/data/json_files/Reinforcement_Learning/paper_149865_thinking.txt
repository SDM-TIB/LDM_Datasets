To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SyntheX: Scaling Up Learning-based X-ray Image Analysis Through In Silico Experiments" by Cong Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of simulated images for training AI models, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **clinical tasks section** where the authors describe three specific applications: hip imaging, surgical robotic tool detection, and COVID-19 lesion segmentation. Each of these tasks likely involves distinct datasets.

In the **hip imaging section**, the authors mention creating a dataset of 366 real hip fluoroscopic images and corresponding high-resolution CT scans from cadaveric specimens. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

For the **surgical robotic tool detection**, they indicate using synthetic images generated from CT scans selected from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database, along with real X-ray images of the continuum manipulator. This implies the existence of two datasets: one synthetic and one real.

In the **COVID-19 lesion segmentation section**, the authors refer to using CT scans from the ImagEng lab and UESTC to generate synthetic chest X-ray data. They also mention a benchmark dataset containing 2,951 real COVID-19 chest X-ray samples for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **New Mexico Decedent Image Database**: 
   > Edgar, H. et al. New Mexico Decedent Image Database. Off. Med. Investig. Univ. New Mexico. (2020). doi.org/10.25827/5s8c-n515.

   > Degerli, A. et al. COVID-19 infection map generation and detection from chest X-ray images. Health Information Science Systems 9, 1–16 (2021).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
