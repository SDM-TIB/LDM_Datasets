To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fitted Q-Learning for Relational Domains" by Srijita Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their evaluations in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on **three classical Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL) domains**: the Blocks World domain (with tasks such as Stack, Unstack, and On) and the Logistics domain. I will note these domains as they represent the datasets used for the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution to the original sources of the datasets.

1. **Blocks World Domain**: The citation for the Blocks World domain is:
   > Slaney, J., & ThiÃ©baux, S. (2001). *Blocks world revisited*. AIJ.

2. **Logistics Domain**: The citation for the Logistics domain is:
   > Boutilier, C., Reiter, R., & Price, B. (2001). *Symbolic dynamic programming for first-order MDPs*. In IJCAI.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
