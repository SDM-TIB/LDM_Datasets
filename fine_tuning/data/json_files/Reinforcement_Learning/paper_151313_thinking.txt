To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language Models to Coding Preferences" by Martin Weyssow et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the introduction of **CodeUltraFeedback**, which is a dataset of 10,000 complex instructions, and **CODAL-Bench**, a benchmark for assessing LLM alignment. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology section**. In the section titled **II. CODEULTRAFEEDBACK**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **CodeUltraFeedback** dataset, which consists of 10,000 complex instructions and 40,000 responses generated by 14 diverse LLMs. The dataset is designed to align LLMs with five coding preferences. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and structure.

Additionally, the authors mention that **CODAL-Bench** is constructed from a subset of **CodeUltraFeedback**, specifically selecting 500 instructions to evaluate LLM alignment. This indicates that **CODAL-Bench** is not a standalone dataset but rather a benchmark derived from **CodeUltraFeedback**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **Magicoder Evol-Instruct dataset**, which serves as the initial dataset for **CodeUltraFeedback**. The citation for this dataset is:
- Wei, Y., Wang, Z., Liu, J., Ding, Y., & Zhang, L. (2023). *Magicoder: Source code is all you need*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.02120.

Since **CODAL-Bench** is derived from **CodeUltraFeedback**, it does not have a separate citation but can be referenced as part of the **CodeUltraFeedback** dataset.

In summary, I will document the following datasets with their respective citations:

1. **CodeUltraFeedback**: A preference dataset of 10,000 complex instructions and 40,000 responses generated using 14 diverse LLMs.
   - Citation: Weyssow, M., Kamanda, A., & Sahraoui, H. (2023). *CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language Models to Coding Preferences*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.14196.

2. **CODAL-Bench**: A benchmark for evaluating LLM alignment, constructed from a subset of **CodeUltraFeedback**.
   - Citation: Refer to **CodeUltraFeedback** for details.

3. **Magicoder Evol-Instruct**: The initial dataset used to create **CodeUltraFeedback**.
   - Citation: Wei, Y., Wang, Z., Liu, J., Ding, Y., & Zhang, L. (2023). *Magicoder: Source code is all you need*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.02120.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
