To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Heads or Tails: Towards Semantically Consistent Visual Counterfactuals" by Simon Vandenhende et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three fine-grained image recognition datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **CUB Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of images of 200 bird classes, with keypoint locations for 15 bird parts. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of counterfactual explanations.

2. **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: This dataset contains images of 120 dog breeds, annotated with keypoint locations of 24 parts. It is also used in their experiments.

3. **iNaturalist-2021 Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,486 bird classes and is noted for its challenging scenes. The authors mention that they hired raters to annotate keypoint locations for a subset of images from this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CUB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Tech. rep., California Institute of Technology.

- For the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., & Fei-Fei, L. (2011). *Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization*. In Proceedings of the CVPR Workshop.

- For the **iNaturalist-2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Cole, E., Beery, S., Wilber, K., Belongie, S., & Mac Aodha, O. (2021). *Benchmarking representation learning for natural world image collections*. In Proceedings of the CVPR.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
