To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Path Planning and Power Allocation of a Cellular-Connected UAV using Apprenticeship Learning via Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Alireza Shamsoshoara et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of UAVs in various applications and mention the need for effective communication strategies. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach to apprenticeship learning and the simulation environment. They mention that an open-source simulator was developed to collect expert information and trajectories based on optimal behavior. This suggests that the simulator itself may generate datasets, but I need to confirm this in the results or experiments section.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the performance evaluation of their proposed methods. They mention using a designed simulation environment with parameters such as the number of cellular base stations and user equipment, but they do not provide specific datasets used for training or testing.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in relation to the simulation or experiments. However, the focus seems to be on the simulation environment rather than external datasets.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors primarily used a simulation environment to generate data rather than relying on pre-existing datasets. Therefore, I will note that while there are no traditional datasets cited, the authors created a simulation framework that serves as a dataset for their experiments.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Environment**: The authors developed an open-source simulator to collect expert trajectories and information based on optimal behavior. This simulator serves as the primary source of data for their experiments.

2. **No External Datasets Cited**: The paper does not reference any external datasets for training or evaluation, focusing instead on the data generated from their simulation.

In conclusion, while I cannot provide traditional dataset citations, I will document the existence of the simulation environment as the source of data for the research.
