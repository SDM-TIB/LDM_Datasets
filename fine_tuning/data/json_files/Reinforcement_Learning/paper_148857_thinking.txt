To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance-Aware Predictive Navigation in Multi-Agent Environments" by Jinkun Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conduct experiments in the **CARLA simulator** and also evaluate their method on **GTA V**. These are key indicators that datasets are involved.

I will also look for any references to specific datasets used for training or evaluation within the experiments. The authors mention using a dataset collected for training a Mask R-CNN model, which is referenced as **[28]** in the references section. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the Mask R-CNN model.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., Koltun, V. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In: Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning. pp. 1–16 (2017).

2. For the dataset used to train the Mask R-CNN model, which is referenced as **[28]**, the citation is:
   > Richter, S.R., Vineet, V., Roth, S., Koltun, V. "Playing for data: Ground truth from computer games." In: ECCV. pp. 102–118. Springer (2016).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
