To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Context Connects Counterfactual Fairness to Robust Prediction and Group Fairness" by Jacy Reese Anthis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on counterfactual fairness and mentions the use of the **Adult income dataset** for experiments, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors state that they conducted experiments using the **Adult income dataset**. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, features, and any relevant characteristics that are mentioned in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the Adult income dataset as follows: it is used to simulate a protected class and is balanced with equal probabilities for the protected classes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on counterfactual fairness.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Adult income dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Adult income dataset**:
  > Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi. *Adult*. 1996. DOI: 10.24432/C5XW20.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Adult income dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset used for predicting income based on demographic and financial records, manipulated to simulate a protected class.
   - **Full Citation**: Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi. *Adult*. 1996. DOI: 10.24432/C5XW20.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly documented and ready for any further processing or analysis.
