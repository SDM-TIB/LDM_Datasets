To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Safe Genetic Algorithm Approach for Energy Efficient Federated Learning in Wireless Communication Networks" by Lina Magoula et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Federated Learning (FL) and mentions a simulation setup that utilizes a specific dataset for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation setup section** (Section V), where the authors describe the FL process. Here, they explicitly mention the use of the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit recognition. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains **60,000 samples** in total, and each worker is assigned a random selection of data samples ranging from **800 to 1200**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. AT&T Labs, 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
