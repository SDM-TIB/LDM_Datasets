To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diminishing Stereotype Bias in Image Generation Model using Reinforcement Learning Feedback" by Xin Chen and Virgile Foussereau, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mitigating gender bias in image generation models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the ethical implications of stereotype biases in image generation but does not specify any datasets used in the experiments.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details regarding the data used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using a "pretrained stable diffusion model" and a "gender classification Transformer model," but again, there are no specific datasets named.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on their experiments, but they do not provide explicit names of datasets either. They refer to prompts used for generating images but do not mention any datasets that were utilized for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. However, the references primarily cite works related to methodologies and models rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments, or they may have used proprietary or unpublished datasets that are not disclosed in the paper.

In conclusion, I will note that no specific datasets were identified in this research paper, and therefore, I cannot provide full citations for datasets as they were not mentioned. This highlights the importance of transparency in research regarding the datasets used, as it allows for reproducibility and further exploration by other researchers.
