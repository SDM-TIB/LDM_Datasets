To extract datasets from the research paper titled "σ-zero: Gradient-based Optimization of ℓ0-norm Adversarial Examples" by Antonio Emanuele Cinà et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method using **MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **ImageNet** datasets for their evaluations. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about each dataset in the paper. In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **ImageNet**: A large dataset with millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2005.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Imagenet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Communications of the ACM, vol. 60, pp. 84–90, 2012.

With the dataset names and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the datasets from the paper, ensuring to include their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
