To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear Transformations Against Unlearnable Datasets" by Thushari Hapuarachchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions "unlearnable CIFAR10 datasets generated by those twelve data protection approaches," indicating that CIFAR10 is one of the datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various data protection approaches and their effectiveness, which suggests that they will reference datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets they utilized. They specifically mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, **MNIST dataset**, and **ImageNet dataset** generated by the Neural Tangent Generalization Attack (NTGA). This section will provide details on how these datasets were manipulated or transformed.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors provide results based on the datasets mentioned earlier. They discuss the performance of their proposed framework on the CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C. (2010). *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
