To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMAP: Explanation by Minimal Adversarial Perturbation" by Matt Chapman-Rounds et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "several standard datasets," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for model-agnostic explanation methods and hint at the datasets used for evaluation. However, I need to look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Half Moons Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset used for testing the model's performance. The authors state that they generated 10,000 samples from this dataset, which is available on scikit-learn.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors converted the MNIST dataset into a binary classification task using only the digits '8' and '3'. They provide details about the train/test split.

3. **UCI Adult Dataset**: The authors used a subset of the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, detailing the preprocessing steps they took.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further insights into how these datasets were utilized and the performance metrics achieved.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Half Moons Dataset**, since it is a synthetic dataset from scikit-learn, I will cite it as follows:
  > Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Prettenhofer, P., Weiss, R., Dubourg, V., Vanderplas, J., Passos, A., Cournapeau, D., Brucher, M., Perrot, M., and Duchesnay, E. (2011). Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 12, 2825-2830.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., and Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For the **UCI Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., and Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper for further processing or review.
