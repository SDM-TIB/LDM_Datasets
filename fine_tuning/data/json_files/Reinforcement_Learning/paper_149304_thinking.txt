To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partially-Supervised Novel Object Captioning Leveraging Context from Paired Data" by Shashank Bujimalla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **MS COCO** and **no-caps** datasets for evaluating their approach, which indicates that these are key datasets to note.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and mention **MS COCO Captions** as a popular dataset. They also refer to the **held-out MS COCO** and **no-caps** datasets as benchmarks for Novel Object Captioning (NOC). This confirms that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. They describe the **held-out MS COCO dataset**, which is a subset of the original MS COCO dataset, and mention that it contains 70,194 images with fully paired data and 12,589 images as partially paired data. They also specify that the held-out dataset excludes image-caption pairs for eight selected novel object classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

- For **no-caps**, the citation is:
  > Harsh Agrawal, Karan Desai, Yufei Wang, Xinlei Chen, Rishabh Jain, Mark Johnson, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Stefan Lee, and Peter Anderson. *nocaps: Novel Object Captioning at Scale*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 8948–8957, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
