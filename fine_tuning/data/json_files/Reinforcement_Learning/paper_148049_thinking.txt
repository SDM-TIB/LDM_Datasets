To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Split Q Learning: Reinforcement Learning with Two-Stream Rewards" by Baihan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a framework for reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the motivation behind the research but still lacks explicit dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any tables or figures that might list datasets used for testing or validation. In this paper, the authors describe their proposed approach and mention testing their agents in **nine computer games**: Pacman, Catcher, FlappyBird, Pixelcopter, Pong, PuckWorld, Snake, WaterWorld, and Monster Kong. However, these are not traditional datasets but rather environments for reinforcement learning experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **future work** sections for any references to datasets that may have been used or planned for future experiments. The authors mention the need to test their model on both healthy subjects and patients with specific mental conditions, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will look into the **References section** to see if any of the cited works might refer to datasets relevant to the research. However, the references primarily discuss theoretical frameworks and previous studies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no traditional datasets cited or used in the experiments. The focus is on the development of a new algorithm rather than on empirical validation with established datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not provide any datasets with full citations, as the experiments are conducted in simulated environments rather than on specific datasets. This will be noted in the final output to ensure clarity regarding the absence of dataset references.
