To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few Shot Teamwork" by Elliot Fosong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the few-shot teamwork (FST) problem but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context for the problem but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or methodology sections** (if present) for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. In this case, the paper does not seem to have a dedicated section for datasets, which suggests that the authors may have used existing datasets or frameworks without naming them directly.

I will then look for any **footnotes or inline citations** that might reference datasets indirectly. If the authors mention any previous works or frameworks that involve datasets, I will note those references.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets relevant to the FST problem. I will look for papers that discuss datasets used in multi-agent reinforcement learning or related fields, as these may provide context or datasets that the authors relied upon.

If I find any relevant datasets mentioned in the references, I will extract their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset from a cited paper, I will ensure to include that citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including any relevant citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the paper does not provide explicit datasets but may rely on existing literature in the field.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and related work for dataset mentions.
2. Checking methodology or experiments sections for explicit dataset references.
3. Looking for footnotes or inline citations that may indicate dataset usage.
4. Reviewing the References section for any relevant datasets cited in other works.
5. Compiling the findings into a clear summary, including full citations for any datasets identified.

This thorough approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
