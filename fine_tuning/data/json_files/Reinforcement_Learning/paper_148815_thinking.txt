To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Generate Your Counterfactuals: Towards Controlled Counterfactual Generation for Text" by Nishtha Madaan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework GYC for generating counterfactual text samples, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section**, which is crucial for identifying the specific datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **DBpedia**: This dataset focuses on locations and organizations, containing 560K training samples and 70K test samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lehmann, J., Isele, R., Jakob, M., Jentzsch, A., Kontokostas, D., Mendes, P., Hellmann, S., Morsey, M., Van Kleef, P., Auer, S., and Bizer, C. (2014). *DBpedia - A Large-scale, Multilingual Knowledge Base Extracted from Wikipedia*. Semantic Web Journal, 6. doi:10.3233/SW-140134.

2. **AgNews**: This dataset contains real-world data with four classes (world, business, sports, and sci-fi), totaling 120K training samples and 7.6K testing samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhang, T., Zhao, J., and LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 649–657.

3. **Yelp**: This dataset focuses on informal text containing reviews, specifically using a filtered version of the Yelp Polarity dataset with 250K negative sentences and 350K positive ones. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shen, T., Lei, T., Barzilay, R., and Jaakkola, T. (2017). *Style Transfer from Non-parallel Text by Cross-alignment*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 6830–6841.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics and the context in which they were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations for clarity and completeness, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented in the final output.
