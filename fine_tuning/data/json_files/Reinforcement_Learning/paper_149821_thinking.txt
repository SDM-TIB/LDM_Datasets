To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Bidding and Playing Strategies in the Trick-Taking Game Wizard using Deep Q-Networks" by Jonas Schumacher and Marco Pleines, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may discuss related works that could hint at datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** closely, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, there is no direct mention of a specific dataset used for training the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) agents. Instead, the authors focus on the Wizard game itself as the environment for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the dataset in this context is the game data generated during the self-play training of the DQN agents.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none explicitly mentioned. However, I will summarize the data generation process described in the paper:

1. **Game Data**: The data consists of the actions taken by the DQN agents during self-play, including the bidding and playing phases of the Wizard game. This data is generated through the interactions of the agents in the game environment.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or datasets related to the Wizard game or similar card games are cited. However, since the focus is on the DQN implementation and the Wizard game itself, there may not be specific datasets to cite.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, noting that the primary dataset is the game data generated during the experiments, and I will summarize the lack of external datasets in this research. If any foundational papers or datasets related to the Wizard game are referenced, I will include their citations as well.

Overall, the extraction process reveals that the dataset is inherently tied to the experimental setup rather than an external dataset, which is a common scenario in research focused on game environments.
