To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated recognition of the pericardium contour on processed CT images using genetic algorithms" by E.O. Rodrigues et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurately identifying the pericardium contour and mention the use of images from previous works. This suggests that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe the input images used for their experiments. They mention using "Computed Tomography fat ranged images" and refer to a ground truth dataset from a previous work. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

The authors specify that the ground truth dataset contains images of 20 patients, totaling 878 images, with manual segmentations of epicardial and mediastinal fats. This dataset is crucial for their methodology.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ground truth dataset mentioned. The reference is:

- For the ground truth dataset, the citation is:
  > E. Rodrigues, F. Morais, N. Morais, L. Conci, L. Neto, A. Conci. *A novel approach for the automated segmentation and volume quantification of cardiac fats on computed tomography*. Computers in Biology and Medicine, 123, 109â€“128, 2016.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the results section, where they might discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
