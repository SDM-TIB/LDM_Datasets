To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value-Decomposition Multi-Agent Actor-Critics" by Jianyu Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on the **StarCraft II micromanagement task**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this task.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their benchmarking against baseline algorithms and refer to the **StarCraft II micromanagement environment (SMAC)**. This indicates that the dataset used for evaluation is related to the StarCraft II game.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the datasets used, including descriptions of the maps and configurations. The appendix contains a table (Table 2) that outlines various maps used in the experiments, which are part of the SMAC dataset. The maps listed include:

1. **2s vs 1sc**: Involves 2 Stalkers against 1 Spine Crawler.
2. **8m**: Involves 8 Marines against 8 Marines.
3. **2s3z**: Involves 2 Stalkers and 3 Zealots against 2 Stalkers and 3 Zealots.
4. **3s5z**: Involves 3 Stalkers and 5 Zealots against 3 Stalkers and 5 Zealots.
5. **1c3s5z**: Involves 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, and 5 Zealots against 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, and 5 Zealots.
6. **bane vs bane**: Involves 20 Zerglings and 4 Banelings against 20 Zerglings and 4 Banelings.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset used in the experiments. The paper references the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, which is a well-known benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

The full citation for the SMAC dataset is:
> Samvelyan, M., Rashid, T., Schroeder de Witt, C., Farquhar, G., Nardelli, N., Rudner, T. G., Hung, C.-M., Torr, P. H., Foerster, J., & Whiteson, S. (2019). The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS), 2186â€“2188. International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
