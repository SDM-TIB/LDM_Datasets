To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperation on the Fly: Exploring Language Agents for Ad Hoc Teamwork in the Avalon Game" by Zijing Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, as they often detail the experimental setup and any datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the AvalonPlay benchmark, which is a multi-agent platform used for their experiments. This indicates that there is a specific dataset or benchmark involved, but I need to confirm its details.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (The AvalonPlay Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the benchmark in detail. They mention that the AvalonPlay benchmark is designed for evaluating LLM agents in the context of ad hoc teamwork. However, they do not provide a separate dataset name; instead, they describe the game mechanics and roles involved in the benchmark.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for training or evaluation. They mention using different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA 2) but do not specify any external datasets. Instead, they focus on the performance of agents within the AvalonPlay benchmark.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather introduces the AvalonPlay benchmark as a novel experimental setup, I will treat the benchmark itself as the primary dataset for this research.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the AvalonPlay benchmark. Since it is a new benchmark introduced in this paper, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **AvalonPlay benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Zijing Shi, Meng Fang, Shunfeng Zheng, Shilong Deng, Ling Chen, Yali Du. *Cooperation on the Fly: Exploring Language Agents for Ad Hoc Teamwork in the Avalon Game*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the AvalonPlay benchmark, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to understand the datasets used in this research.
