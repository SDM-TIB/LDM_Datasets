To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications" by Tuomas Haarnoja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm on various benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 7, where they compare their method against other algorithms on benchmark tasks. This section is likely to contain specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon examining section 7, I find that the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym benchmark suite** for their experiments. This suite includes several continuous control tasks, which implies that there are multiple datasets involved, but I need to identify the specific tasks and their corresponding datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The OpenAI Gym is a well-known resource, and I can find its citation easily.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Additionally, the paper mentions specific tasks such as **Hopper-v2**, **Walker2d-v2**, **HalfCheetah-v2**, **Ant-v2**, and **Humanoid-v2**. These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym suite, and I will include them in the dataset entries.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

1. **OpenAI Gym Benchmark Suite**: This suite includes various continuous control tasks used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Specific Tasks**:
   - **Hopper-v2**: A task involving a 2D hopper robot.
   - **Walker2d-v2**: A task involving a 2D bipedal walker.
   - **HalfCheetah-v2**: A task involving a 2D half-cheetah robot.
   - **Ant-v2**: A task involving a 3D ant robot.
   - **Humanoid-v2**: A task involving a 3D humanoid robot.

These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym and do not require separate citations as they are included in the citation for the OpenAI Gym.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
