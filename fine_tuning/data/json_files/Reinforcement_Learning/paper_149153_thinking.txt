To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for Evaluating Post Hoc Feature-Additive Explainers" by Zachariah Carmichael and Walter J. Scheirer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of explainers on "thousands of synthetic and several real-world tasks," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly listed. In this section, the authors mention evaluating explainers on several real-world datasets, including:

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: This dataset contains median home values in Boston, which can be predicted by various covariates, including sensitive attributes related to race.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset, collected by ProPublica, contains covariates such as criminal history and demographics, along with the proprietary COMPAS risk score and recidivism data for defendants from Broward County, Florida.

3. **FICO Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Dataset**: This dataset comprises anonymous HELOC applications made by consumers requesting a credit line, with the task being to predict repayment ability.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, which has been down-sampled for the purposes of this study.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. Here are the citations I will look for:

- For the **Boston Housing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Harrison, Jr., D. L. Rubinfeld. *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1), 81–102, 1978. doi:10.1016/0095-0696(78)90006-2.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., Kirchner, L. *Machine bias: there’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks.* ProPublica, 2016. Available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

- For the **FICO HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > FICO. *FICO explainable machine learning challenge: Home equity line of credit (HELOC) dataset*. 2018. Available at: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278–2324, 1998. doi:10.1109/5.726791.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that each dataset is properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
