To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Least Squares Regression with Markovian Data" by Guy Bresler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that detail their structure or size.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of a **Gaussian Autoregressive (AR) Markov Chain** for their experiments. They mention that the data points are generated from this Markov chain, but I need to confirm if they refer to any publicly available datasets or if they created their own synthetic data.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or prior works that introduced datasets relevant to their study. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This should be the official name as used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, features, and any specific characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset**, I would document it as follows:
- **Name**: Penn Action Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing video clips of various actions, annotated with keypoints for pose estimation.
- **Citation**: Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have compiled this information for all datasets mentioned in the paper, I will organize it clearly to ensure that it is easy to read and understand. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
