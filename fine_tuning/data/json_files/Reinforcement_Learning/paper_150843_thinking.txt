To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Engineering Algorithm (GEA): An Efficient Metaheuristic Algorithm for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems" by Majid Sohrabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the Genetic Engineering Algorithm (GEA) on benchmark instances, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various combinatorial optimization problems and reference existing algorithms, but I need to find explicit dataset names.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors mention that they conducted evaluations on "a set of benchmark instances" and refer to specific instances from the literature. I will look for any explicit dataset names or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference six well-established instances from the literature for benchmarking their algorithms. However, they do not provide specific dataset names within the text. Instead, they cite references that likely contain the dataset information.

I will now check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets used in their experiments. The references that are likely to contain the dataset information are:

1. **Elshaer, R., and Awad, H. (2020)**. A taxonomic review of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the vehicle routing problem and its variants. *Computers and Industrial Engineering*, 140, 106242.
2. **Fathollahi-Fard, A. M., Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, M., and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, R. (2020)**. Red deer algorithm (RDA): a new nature-inspired meta-heuristic. *Soft Computing*, 24, 14637-14665.

These references likely contain the datasets or benchmark instances used in the experiments. I will extract the full citations for these references to ensure proper attribution.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

In summary, I will:
1. Identify the relevant sections of the paper.
2. Look for explicit mentions of datasets or benchmark instances.
3. Check the references for full citations related to the datasets used in the experiments.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for each dataset.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
