To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Causal Link Estimation under Hidden Confounding using Knockoff Interventions" by Violeta Teodora Trifunov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to both synthetic datasets and real aerosol-cloud-climate observational time series data. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific names of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of causal link estimation and mentions the use of synthetic datasets, but does not specify names.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe how they generated synthetic data to validate their causal link estimation method. They provide equations that define the relationships between the variables in this synthetic dataset, but do not provide a formal citation since it is generated by the authors.

2. **Cloud and Aerosol Observation Data**: The authors refer to a dataset provided by Jesson et al. (2021), which consists of gridded measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2004 to 2019. They specify that this dataset includes measurements of cloud optical depth (COD) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), along with several meteorological variables used as proxies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the cloud and aerosol observation dataset:

- For the **Cloud and Aerosol Observation Data**, the citation is:
  > Jesson, Andrew, Manshausen, Peter, Douglas, Alyson, et al. 2021. Using Non-Linear Causal Models to Study Aerosol-Cloud Interactions in the Southeast Pacific. In: NeurIPS 2021 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning.

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is generated by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the cloud and aerosol observation dataset and clearly indicate that the synthetic dataset is generated by the authors without a formal citation.
