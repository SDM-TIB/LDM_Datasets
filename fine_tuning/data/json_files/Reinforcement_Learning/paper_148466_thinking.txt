To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-step deep reinforcement learning for open-loop control of laminar and turbulent flows" by H. Ghraieb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are used for comparison or evaluation.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the experimental setup or simulations. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. I will look for any mentions of numerical simulations, experimental data, or benchmark datasets.

The **results section** is crucial as it often summarizes the findings and may include references to datasets used for validation. I will look for any tables or figures that present results based on specific datasets, as these will help confirm the datasets' relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "NACA 0012 airfoil dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, if they reference a dataset related to turbulent flows, I will ensure to find its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed.

In summary, my approach involves:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identifying specific datasets and their relevance to the research.
3. Consulting the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
