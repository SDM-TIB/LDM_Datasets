To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mirror Learning: A Unifying Framework of Policy Optimisation" by Jakub Grudzien Kuba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract does not mention specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction. Here, the authors discuss various reinforcement learning algorithms but do not specify datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 7) where the authors describe their numerical experiments. They mention testing their algorithms in three simple environments: **Single-step Game**, **Tabular Game**, and **GridWorld**. However, these are not traditional datasets but rather simulated environments used for testing.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or benchmarks, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references primarily consist of foundational papers and algorithms in reinforcement learning, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no external datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The authors rely on simulated environments for their experiments rather than established datasets.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Single-step Game**: A simulated environment where the agent chooses one of five actions with associated rewards.
2. **Tabular Game**: A simple game with five states and specific reward structures.
3. **GridWorld**: A 5x5 grid environment with barriers and rewards for reaching specific goals.

Since these are not traditional datasets with citations, I will note that no external datasets were referenced in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
