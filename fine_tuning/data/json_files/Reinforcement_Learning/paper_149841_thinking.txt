To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIN: Graph-based Interaction-aware Constraint Policy Optimization for Autonomous Driving" by Se-Wook Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a navigation scenario with CARLA, an urban driving simulator, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulator.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the specific datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or simulation environments. In this case, the authors mention using **CARLA**, which is a well-known simulator for autonomous driving research.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to CARLA or other datasets that may have been used in their experiments. The CARLA simulator is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to include its full citation.

The citation for CARLA is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning (pp. 1-16).

Since CARLA is the primary dataset mentioned in the context of the experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
