To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General Learning Framework for Open Ad Hoc Teamwork Using Graph-based Policy Learning" by Arrasy Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets relevant to their work. If any datasets are mentioned, I will note their names and any details provided.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, type, and purpose).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Note the names and details of any datasets found.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
