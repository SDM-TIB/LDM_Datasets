To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Goal-Directed Reinforcement Learning by Model Characterization" by Shoubhik Debnath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the tasks or environments they used, which could lead to the identification of specific datasets.

Then, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the experiments conducted, including the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will review it thoroughly to gather all relevant information. This section may provide specific details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific simulation environment or benchmark dataset, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing complete citations for each one.
