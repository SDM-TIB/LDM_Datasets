To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical Block-wise Neural Network Architecture Generation" by Zhao Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of designing neural networks and may reference datasets indirectly. However, I still do not see any specific datasets mentioned.

Now, I will move on to the **methodology** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss experiments or evaluations. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. 

Upon reviewing the methodology, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. They describe these datasets in terms of their characteristics, such as the number of classes and images, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

Next, I will check the **results** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional details about their application in the experiments.

After confirming the use of the CIFAR datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, which is critical for academic integrity and reproducibility.
