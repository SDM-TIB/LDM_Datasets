To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CINA: Conditional Implicit Neural Atlas for Spatio-Temporal Representation of Fetal Brains" by Maik Dannecker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **dHCP** and **FeTA**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on the parts where the authors describe their evaluation and the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, they mention using a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI scans from the **dHCP** dataset and the **FeTA** dataset. 

I will then extract specific details about each dataset:

1. **dHCP Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing T2 weighted 3D MRI of 138 fetal brains showing no abnormalities, with an isotropic resolution of 0.5 mm. The age range of the subjects is between 22 and 38 weeks gestational age.

2. **FeTA Dataset**: This dataset includes T2 weighted 3D MRI of 80 neurotypical and pathological fetal brains, also with 0.5 mm isotropic resolution. The authors note that 30 normal and 30 abnormal cases were used, with an age range of 21 to 36 weeks gestational age.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **dHCP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Price, A.N., et al. "The developing human connectome project (dhcp): fetal acquisition protocol." In Proceedings of the annual meeting of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), vol. 244, 2019.

- For the **FeTA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Payette, K., et al. "An automatic multi-tissue human fetal brain segmentation benchmark using the fetal tissue annotation dataset." Scientific Data 8(1), 167 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00946-3.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
