To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning-based Wavefront Sensorless Adaptive Optics Approaches for Satellite-to-Ground Laser Communication" by Payam Parvizi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an adaptive optics reinforcement learning (RL) environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the simulations or experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Wavefront Sensorless Adaptive Optics RL Environment)**, where the authors describe the RL environment they developed. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used for training and testing the RL algorithms. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this section, the authors mention the use of the **HCIPy: High Contrast Imaging for Python package** as the foundation for their RL environment. This package likely includes datasets related to adaptive optics, atmospheric turbulence modeling, and fiber coupling. I will note this as a dataset source.

Additionally, I will check the **experimental methodology section** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets used in their experiments or simulations. They may provide details about the parameters and conditions under which the datasets were generated or utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. For example, if the HCIPy package is referenced, I will look for its citation to ensure proper attribution.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will be crucial for maintaining academic integrity and allowing others to access the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing.
