To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search for Quantum Reinforcement Learning" by Yize Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of DQAS in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) and hints at the use of various datasets, but does not specify them directly.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Chapter IV), where the authors mention conducting experiments in two benchmark reinforcement learning environments: **Cart Pole** and **Frozen Lake**. This indicates that these environments are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these environments. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

1. For **Cart Pole**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym, wiki, CartPole v0. Retrieved from https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0

2. For **Frozen Lake**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym, wiki, FrozenLake v0. Retrieved from https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/FrozenLake-v0

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Cart Pole**: A reinforcement learning environment used for evaluating the DQAS method.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym, wiki, CartPole v0. Retrieved from https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0

2. **Frozen Lake**: Another reinforcement learning environment utilized in the experiments.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym, wiki, FrozenLake v0. Retrieved from https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/FrozenLake-v0

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
