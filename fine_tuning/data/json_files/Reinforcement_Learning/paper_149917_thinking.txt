To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Quantum Circuit Design with Nested Monte Carlo Tree Search" by Pei-Yong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and it may mention specific datasets used for numerical experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized.

In the **methods section**, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup or the algorithms used. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe any specific datasets used for training or testing their algorithms, I will note these down.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize results based on different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset** or a specific quantum chemistry dataset, I will ensure to find the corresponding citation for each.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
