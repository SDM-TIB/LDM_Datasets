To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value-of-Information based Arbitration between Model-based and Model-free Control" by Krishn Bera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of skill learning and reinforcement learning but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **method section** where they describe the environment used for their experiments.

In **section II (Method)**, the authors specify that they used the **Taxi-v2 environment** available in OpenAI Gym for their simulations. This is a clear indication of a dataset or environment being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, which is crucial for proper documentation. The relevant reference is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the algorithm and its performance rather than multiple datasets, the **Taxi-v2 environment** is the only dataset mentioned.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Taxi-v2 environment** using the required format, ensuring to include the full citation for proper referencing.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, focusing on the single dataset identified in the paper.
