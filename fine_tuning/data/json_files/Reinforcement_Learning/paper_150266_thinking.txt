To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Trained Image Encoder for Generalizable Visual Reinforcement Learning" by Zhecheng Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights that extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on four benchmarks: **DMControl Generalization Benchmark**, **DMControl Manipulation Tasks**, **Drawer World**, and **CARLA**. This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the necessary details for each dataset, including the original papers or sources from which they are derived.

1. **DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB)**: This benchmark is developed based on the DeepMind Control Suite, which is a widely used benchmark for continuous control tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
