To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cosine Similarity-based Method for Out-of-Distribution Detection" by Nguyen Ngoc-Hieu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and reference various methods and datasets used in previous works. This section may provide context for the datasets they are using.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** as in-distribution datasets, and they also list several out-of-distribution datasets: **SVHN**, **LSUN-Crop**, **LSUN-Resize**, **iSUN**, **Textures**, and **Places365**.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors provide a brief description of the datasets in the experimental setup, which will help me summarize their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report, 2009.

3. **SVHN**:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., and Ng, A. Y. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

4. **LSUN-Crop**:
   > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., and Xiao, J. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

5. **LSUN-Resize**:
   > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., and Xiao, J. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

6. **iSUN**:
   > Xu, P., Ehinger, K. A., Zhang, Y., Finkelstein, A., Kulkarni, S. R., and Xiao, J. *Turkergaze: Crowdsourcing saliency with webcam based eye tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.06755, 2015.

7. **Textures**:
   > Cimpoi, M., Maji, S., Kokkinos, I., Mohamed, S., and Vedaldi, A. *Describing textures in the wild*. Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 3606–3613, 2014.

8. **Places365**:
   > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., and Torralba, A. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452–1464, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by others interested in this area of study.
