To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-Ray CT Reconstruction of Additively Manufactured Parts using 2.5D Deep Learning MBIR" by Amirkoushyar Ziabari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of X-ray computed tomography (XCT) for non-destructive evaluation of additively manufactured parts, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach to using CAD models and simulated XCT measurements. They mention voxelizing a CAD model and adding defects, which suggests that they created a synthetic dataset for their experiments. However, I need to confirm if this dataset has a specific name or if it is referred to in a particular way.

In the **results section**, the authors present comparisons of reconstruction methods and mention the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) values for different methods, but they do not provide a formal name for the dataset used. It appears that the dataset is derived from their own simulations rather than a publicly available dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will focus on documenting the synthetic dataset they created. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of a voxelized CAD model with added defects, which they used for training their deep learning model. I will summarize this dataset as follows:

1. **Synthetic CAD Model Dataset**: This dataset consists of a voxelized representation of a CAD model of an additively manufactured part, which includes random defects such as voids and holes. The dataset was generated for the purpose of training the 2.5D DL-MBIR network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets. However, the references primarily cite previous works related to reconstruction techniques and do not provide a citation for the synthetic dataset, as it is not a standard dataset but rather a custom dataset created for this study.

Since there are no formal citations for external datasets, I will document the synthetic dataset as follows:

- **Synthetic CAD Model Dataset**: No formal citation available as it is a custom dataset created by the authors for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to note that it is a synthetic dataset without a formal citation. This will provide clarity on the nature of the dataset used in the research.
