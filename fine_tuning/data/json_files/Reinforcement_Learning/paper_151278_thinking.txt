To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling the Quality of Dialogical Explanations" by Milad Alshomary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a corpus of 399 dialogues from the Reddit forum "Explain Like I am Five" (ELI5), which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Corpus Construction** section. Here, the authors describe their methodology for acquiring the ELI5 dialogues, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and significance.

In **section 3.1 (Explanation Dialogue Acquisition)**, the authors explain how they collected the dialogues over three years using the Pushshift Reddit API. They mention that they curated a new explanation dialogue corpus consisting of 399 dialogues covering 204 questions, which is essential information for the dataset entry.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ELI5 dataset. The authors reference their own previous work, which is important for proper citation. The relevant citation for the ELI5 dataset is:

- For the ELI5 dataset, the citation is:
  > Angela Fan, Yacine Jernite, Ethan Perez, David Grangier, Jason Weston, and Michael Auli. *ELI5: Long form question answering*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3558â€“3567, Florence, Italy, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the ELI5 dialogue corpus, which is significant for studying explanation dialogues and their quality. I will ensure that the citation is included in the final output for proper attribution.
