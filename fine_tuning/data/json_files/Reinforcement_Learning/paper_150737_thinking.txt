To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESRL: Efficient Sampling-based Reinforcement Learning for Sequence Generation" by Chenglong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on traditional sequence generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **Experiments** section, where they describe the datasets used for machine translation and abstractive summarization tasks.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **IWSLT’14 German-English (De-En)**: A small-scale dataset used for machine translation.
2. **WMT’14 English-German (En-De)**: A large-scale dataset also used for machine translation.
3. **CNN/DM Dataset**: Used for the abstractive summarization task.
4. **Alpaca’s 52k Data**: Used for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
5. **GPT-4 Alpaca Data**: Another dataset used for RLHF.
6. **GPT-4 Comparison Dataset**: Used to train the reward model.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
