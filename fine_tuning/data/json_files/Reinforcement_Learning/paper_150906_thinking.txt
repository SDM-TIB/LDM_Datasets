To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Defect Analysis of 3D Printed Cylinder Object Using Transfer Learning Approaches" by Md Manjurul Ahsan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves analyzing images of 3D-printed cylinders, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Collection)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used in their research. They state that the dataset was provided by the Smart Materials and Intelligent Systems (SMIS) Laboratory and consists of images of 3D-printed cylindrical objects, some of which are defective and others non-defective. This section is crucial as it provides details about the dataset's nature.

The paper mentions that the dataset is balanced and imbalanced, with specific allocations for training and testing across two studies. The details provided include the number of defective and non-defective samples used in each study, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is collected from the SMIS Laboratory, I will note that it may not have a formal citation like published datasets. However, I will still document it as follows:

- **Dataset**: 3D Printed Cylinder Images
  - **Description**: A collection of images of 3D-printed cylindrical objects, including both defective and non-defective examples, provided by the Smart Materials and Intelligent Systems (SMIS) Laboratory, University of Oklahoma.
  - **Citation**: Ahsan, M. M., Raman, S., & Siddique, Z. (2023). Defect Analysis of 3D Printed Cylinder Object Using Transfer Learning Approaches. Preprint.

Since the dataset is not published in a traditional sense, the citation reflects the authors and the title of the paper where the dataset is discussed.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details, including the dataset's description and citation, which is critical for proper attribution and further research.
