To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HRL4IN: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Navigation with Mobile Manipulators" by Chengshu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in two environments, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the problem but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. Here, they mention two environments: **Interactive ToyEnv** and **Interactive Gibson Environment**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather simulation environments where the experiments are conducted.

I will also look into the **Appendix A (Environment Details)**, which provides more information about the environments. It describes the configurations and parameters of the Interactive ToyEnv and Interactive Gibson Environment, but again, these are not datasets that can be cited in the traditional sense.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide specific dataset citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. The focus is primarily on the environments used for testing the proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning method rather than on datasets that could be cited.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses two experimental environments, it does not provide any datasets that can be cited. Therefore, there are no dataset citations to extract from this paper.
