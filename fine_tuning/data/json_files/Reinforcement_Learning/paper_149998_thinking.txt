To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Causal Structure of Domain Invariant Supervised Representation Learning" by Zihao Wang and Victor Veitch, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it usually contains comprehensive details about each dataset, including its name, size, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

Similarly, if the paper mentions another dataset, such as **MNIST**, I will find its citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, including any supplementary datasets that may be referenced in the text or figures. This thorough approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets and that I provide complete citations for each one.
