To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distal Explanations for Model-free Explainable Reinforcement Learning" by Prashan Madumal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments in **six reinforcement learning benchmarks**. I will look for specific names of these benchmarks or datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several specific datasets and benchmarks used in their experiments. I will list these datasets along with their descriptions:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes various environments for testing RL agents.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

2. **StarCraft II**: The authors mention using custom maps and scenarios built on the StarCraft II platform for their experiments.
   - Citation: Vinyals, O., Ewalds, T., Bartunov, S., Georgiev, P., Vezhnevets, A. S., Yeo, M., Makhzani, A., KÃ¼ttler, H., Agapiou, J., & Schrittwieser, J. (2017). StarCraft II: A new challenge for reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782.

3. **CartPole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
   - Citation: OpenAI Gym documentation.

4. **MountainCar**: Another classic problem where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.
   - Citation: OpenAI Gym documentation.

5. **Taxi**: A discrete environment where the agent must pick up and drop off passengers.
   - Citation: OpenAI Gym documentation.

6. **LunarLander**: A physics-based environment where the agent must land a spacecraft safely.
   - Citation: OpenAI Gym documentation.

7. **BipedalWalker**: An environment where the agent must walk on two legs.
   - Citation: OpenAI Gym documentation.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned above are either directly provided in the text or can be inferred from the context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
