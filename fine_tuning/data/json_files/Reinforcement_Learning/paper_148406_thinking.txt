To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Software-Level Accuracy Using Stochastic Computing With Charge-Trap-Flash Based Weight Matrix" by Varun Bhatt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors report achieving specific accuracies on the **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into **section V (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. They also discuss the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which contain 50,000 training and 10,000 test images of real-world objects, with CIFAR-10 having 10 classes and CIFAR-100 having 100 classes.

In addition, the authors mention using the **Mountain Car** environment for reinforcement learning, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. “Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition.” *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky. “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.” *Citeseer*, Tech. Rep., 2009.

3. For the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky. “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.” *Citeseer*, Tech. Rep., 2009. (Note: CIFAR-100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR-10 as they are part of the same dataset collection.)

4. For the **Mountain Car environment**, the citation is:
   > A. W. Moore. “Efficient memory-based learning for robot control,” 1990.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
