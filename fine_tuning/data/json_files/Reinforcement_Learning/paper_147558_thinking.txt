To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRUST-PCL: An Off-Policy Trust Region Method for Continuous Control" by Oﬁr Nachum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may indicate if datasets are utilized for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several environments from **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. Specifically, they refer to the following tasks:

1. **Acrobot**: A discrete-control task.
2. **HalfCheetah**: A continuous-control task utilizing the MuJoCo environment.
3. **Swimmer**: Another continuous-control task from MuJoCo.
4. **Hopper**: A continuous-control task from MuJoCo.
5. **Walker2d**: A continuous-control task from MuJoCo.
6. **Ant**: A continuous-control task from MuJoCo.

These environments are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, and the authors have used them to evaluate the performance of their proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo, I will provide the relevant citations for these resources:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Acrobot** (part of OpenAI Gym)
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **HalfCheetah** (part of MuJoCo)
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov et al. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

3. **Swimmer** (part of MuJoCo)
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov et al. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

4. **Hopper** (part of MuJoCo)
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov et al. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

5. **Walker2d** (part of MuJoCo)
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov et al. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

6. **Ant** (part of MuJoCo)
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov et al. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
