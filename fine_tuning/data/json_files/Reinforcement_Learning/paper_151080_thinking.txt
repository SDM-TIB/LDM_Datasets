To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling non-linear Effects with Neural Networks in Relational Event Models" by Edoardo Filippi-Mazzola and Ernst C. Wit, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and it may mention specific datasets or applications that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (US patent citation network)**, as it appears to be a key section where the authors discuss a specific dataset used for their analysis. In this section, the authors mention the US patent citation network, which contains nearly 100 million citations and about 8 million patents from 1976 to 2022. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and relevant to their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **simulation study** sections, as these may include synthetic datasets used for testing the DREAM model. The authors may describe how they generated relational event data for their simulations, which could also be considered a dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the US patent citation network, I will look for any relevant papers or sources that provide the dataset or describe its creation.

The key datasets I will extract are:

1. **US Patent Citation Network**: This dataset is described in detail in section 5, and I will ensure to capture its significance and the context in which it is used.

2. **Synthetic Relational Event Data**: If the authors provide details on how they generated this data for their simulations, I will document that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are complete and formatted correctly.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
