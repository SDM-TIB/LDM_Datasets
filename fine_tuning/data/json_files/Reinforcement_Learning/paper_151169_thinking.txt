To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comparison of RL-based and PID controllers for 6-DOF swimming robots: hybrid underwater object tracking" by Faraz Lotfi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for training or evaluation, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets or data generation methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments. Here, they mention generating a dataset of 1200 images using augmentation methods for training YOLOv7. This indicates that there is a specific dataset created for the experiments, which I need to document.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors reference a dataset called the "Video Diver Dataset (VDD-C)", which contains 100,000 annotated images of divers underwater. This is crucial information that I need to include.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset from the experiments**:
   - **Dataset Name**: Custom Dataset for YOLOv7 Training
   - **Description**: A dataset of 1200 images generated using augmentation methods for training the YOLOv7 model in the context of underwater object tracking.

2. **Video Diver Dataset (VDD-C)**:
   - **Dataset Name**: Video Diver Dataset (VDD-C)
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 100,000 annotated images of divers underwater, used for training and evaluating object detection models.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Custom Dataset for YOLOv7 Training**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will note it as:
  > Lotfi, F., Virji, K., & Dudek, G. (2023). *Robust scuba diver tracking and recovery in open water using YOLOv7, SORT, and spiral search*. In 2023 20th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV).

- For the **Video Diver Dataset (VDD-C)**, the citation is:
  > de Langis, K., Fulton, M., & Sattar, J. (2021). *Video Diver Dataset (VDD-C): 100,000 annotated images of divers underwater*.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset with its name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
