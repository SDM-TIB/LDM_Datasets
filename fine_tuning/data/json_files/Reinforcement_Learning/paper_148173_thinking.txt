To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biomimetic Ultra-Broadband Perfect Absorbers Optimised with Reinforcement Learning" by Trevon Badloe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a double deep Q-learning network (DDQN) to design absorbers based on the structure of a moth's eye, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets or materials used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the design of metamaterials and mentions various structures but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any tables or figures that might contain data or results derived from specific datasets. In this paper, the authors provide tables that list the materials used for the moth-eye structures and their corresponding absorption results. 

In **Table 1**, the authors list possible dielectric materials for the spacer layer, which includes:
- Alumina (Al2O3)
- Silicon (Si)
- Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)

In **Table 2**, they provide a list of possible metallic materials for the back reflector, including:
- Aluminium (Al)
- Silver (Ag)
- Gold (Au)
- Chromium (Cr)
- Copper (Cu)
- Iron (Fe)
- Nickel (Ni)
- Titanium (Ti)
- Tungsten (W)

Additionally, **Table 4** summarizes the best results of the optimization process for each moth-eye material, detailing the periodicity, height, radius of curvature, spacer thickness, spacer material, substrate material, and average absorption percentage for various metals.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or materials mentioned. However, the paper does not explicitly cite datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets). Instead, it references materials and their properties, which are derived from the Lumerical material database.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with full citations, I will summarize the materials used in the experiments and their corresponding references:

1. **Dielectric Materials**:
   - Alumina (Al2O3)
   - Silicon (Si)
   - Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)

2. **Metallic Materials**:
   - Aluminium (Al)
   - Silver (Ag)
   - Gold (Au)
   - Chromium (Cr)
   - Copper (Cu)
   - Iron (Fe)
   - Nickel (Ni)
   - Titanium (Ti)
   - Tungsten (W)

3. **Material Database Reference**:
   - All material data is taken from the Lumerical material database, which is not cited in the references but is mentioned in the text.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets with full citations, it does reference materials and their properties that are essential for the experiments conducted. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
