To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Contrastive Spoken Language Understanding" by Umberto Cappellazzo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two established SLU datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on two SLU datasets: **Fluent Speech Commands (FSC)** and **Spoken Language Understanding Resource Package (SLURP)**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset.

For the **Fluent Speech Commands (FSC)** dataset, the authors describe it as containing 30,043 English utterances recorded at 16 kHz, resulting in 31 intent classes. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's size and structure.

For the **SLURP dataset**, the authors mention that it comprises around 56 hours of audio of people interacting with a home assistant, along with an additional 43.5 hours of synthetic data. The dataset is noted for its lexical complexity, with each utterance annotated with three semantics: scenario, action, and entity, leading to a total of 18 scenarios and 69 intents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Fluent Speech Commands (FSC)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Loren Lugosch, Mirco Ravanelli, Patrick Ignoto, Vikrant Singh Tomar, and Yoshua Bengio. *Speech model pre-training for end-to-end spoken language understanding*. Proceedings of Interspeech, 2019.

2. For the **SLURP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Emanuele Bastianelli, Andrea Vanzo, Pawel Swietojanski, and Verena Rieser. *SLURP: A spoken language understanding resource package*. Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 7252â€“7262, 2020.

With the dataset names and their respective citations in hand, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, as this is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
