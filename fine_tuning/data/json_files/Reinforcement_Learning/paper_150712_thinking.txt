To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CycleIK: Neuro-inspired Inverse Kinematics" by Jan-Gerrit Habekost et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the models are trained and tested on dense datasets collected from the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Method** section, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets: **Small1000**, **Full1000**, and **Full1400**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of samples and the workspace configurations.

The authors describe the **Small1000 dataset** as containing 1,000,000 samples limited to a specific area of the workspace, while the **Full1000** and **Full1400 datasets** contain 1,000,000 and 1,400,000 samples, respectively, sampled from the entire workspace. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that describe these datasets. However, in this case, the datasets appear to be original contributions of the authors and may not have separate citations. Therefore, I will document them as part of the CycleIK framework.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the datasets:

- For **Small1000** dataset:
  > Habekost, J.-G., Strahl, E., Allgeuer, P., Kerzel, M., & Wermter, S. (2023). *CycleIK: Neuro-inspired Inverse Kinematics*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date].

- For **Full1000** dataset:
  > Habekost, J.-G., Strahl, E., Allgeuer, P., Kerzel, M., & Wermter, S. (2023). *CycleIK: Neuro-inspired Inverse Kinematics*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date].

- For **Full1400** dataset:
  > Habekost, J.-G., Strahl, E., Allgeuer, P., Kerzel, M., & Wermter, S. (2023). *CycleIK: Neuro-inspired Inverse Kinematics*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset and their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
