To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary Algorithms for Designing Reversible Cellular Automata" by Luca Mariot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail experimental setups or data sources. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results** section, where the authors may discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to the datasets. This could provide additional context or confirm the datasets previously identified.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size or structure.
3. The full citation as provided in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively from the research paper.
