To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEPG: A Minimalist Ensemble Policy Gradient Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Qiang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **PyBullet suite**, which is a physics simulation environment. However, they do not specify any particular datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets). Instead, they refer to environments within the PyBullet suite, which serve as the basis for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the environments or datasets used. In this case, the PyBullet suite is referenced, and I will need to provide its citation.

The citation for the PyBullet suite is:
> Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai. *Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. http://pybullet.org, 2016â€“2021.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset-like reference is the PyBullet suite.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PyBullet suite as the dataset used in the experiments.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
