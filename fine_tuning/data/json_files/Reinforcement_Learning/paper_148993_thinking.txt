To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heuristics for Optimizing 3D Mapping Missions over Swarm-Powered Ad Hoc Clouds" by Leandro R. Costa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of a swarm-powered distributed 3D mapping mission, which suggests that there may be datasets related to 3D mapping or drone operations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide details about the datasets used for testing or validation. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may describe the datasets used for their computational results. I will look for any explicit names of datasets, such as "3D mapping dataset" or "UAV operational dataset," and note their descriptions, including the number of images, types of data collected, and any relevant parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "CAPsac dataset" or "UAV mapping dataset," I will find the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or repository where it can be accessed.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
