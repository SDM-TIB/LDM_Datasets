To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tonic: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Fast Prototyping and Benchmarking" by Fabio Pardo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the need for a flexible codebase for reinforcement learning research but does not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments and benchmark sections** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 5 (Environments)**, the paper lists several environments used for benchmarking, specifically mentioning that Tonic supports environments from **OpenAI Gym**, **DeepMind Control Suite**, and **PyBullet**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **benchmark section**. The paper states that Tonic includes a large-scale benchmark with training logs and model weights for 70 continuous-control tasks, which are derived from the aforementioned environments. However, it does not provide specific dataset names or citations.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the datasets or environments used. The following citations are relevant:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

3. **PyBullet**:
   > Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai. *PyBullet, a Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. 2016. URL https://pybullet.org.

Now that I have identified the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **OpenAI Gym** (Brockman et al., 2016)
- **DeepMind Control Suite** (Tassa et al., 2018)
- **PyBullet** (Coumans & Bai, 2016)

These datasets are essential for the experiments and benchmarks described in the paper, and I will ensure to include their full citations in any subsequent documentation or reporting.
