To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lights out: training RL agents robust to temporary blindness" by Nathan Ordonez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference previous works that used specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain details about the environments used for training and testing the RL agents. I will look for any specific names of datasets or environments that are used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the maze environments they created for testing their approach. They mention two maze environments but do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they seem to have designed these mazes specifically for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the datasets in this context refer to the custom maze environments created by the authors.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will not need to look for citations in the references section for datasets. However, I will still document the maze environments as datasets, as they are integral to the experiments conducted.

The two maze environments described in the paper are:

1. **Maze Environment 1**: This maze is designed to test the agent's ability to navigate through various challenges, including an open room, zigzag paths, and forks. The agent starts at a designated point and aims to reach a goal.

2. **Maze Environment 2**: This maze is used to empirically check how long of a blindness mask the agents can handle while still successfully reaching the goal.

Now, I will compile the information about these maze environments into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation of the paper for reference.

The citation for the paper is:
> Nathan Ordonez, Marije Tromp, Pau Marquez Julbe, and Wendelin BÃ¶mer. *Lights out: training RL agents robust to temporary blindness*. Delft University of Technology.

In summary, I will document the two maze environments as datasets used in the experiments, along with the citation of the paper, as there are no external datasets referenced.
