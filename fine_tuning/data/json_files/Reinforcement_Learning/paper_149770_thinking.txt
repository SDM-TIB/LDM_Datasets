To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Highly Adaptive Acoustic Model for Accurate Multi-Dialect Speech Recognition" by Sanghyun Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on large-scale speech datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide statistics about the datasets used. Here, they mention that the models were evaluated on English speech data from users of eight different dialects, including native and non-native speakers. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: This dataset is used for native speech data, consisting of 960 hours of English speech.
2. **Speech Ocean Datasets**: These datasets are used for non-native speech data, including various dialects such as Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Korean.

The paper provides statistics for the training sets of these dialects, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LibriSpeech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Cuoguo Chen, Danial Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

- For the **Speech Ocean Datasets**, the citation is:
  > KingLine Data Center. *ASR corpus*. Available at: http://kingline.speechocean.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
