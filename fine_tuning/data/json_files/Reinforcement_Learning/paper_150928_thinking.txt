To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Unit Test Data Generation and Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Code Synthesis" by Philip John Gorinski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the generation of data consisting of function signatures and associated unit tests, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention using the **Mostly Basic Python Problems Dataset (MBPP)**, which is described as containing 964 instances of natural language problem descriptions, associated gold solutions, and unit tests. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **related work** and **approach** sections. The authors reference other datasets such as **APPS** and **MBPP** in the context of existing code datasets with functional tests. 

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract include:

1. **Mostly Basic Python Problems Dataset (MBPP)**:
   > Jacob Austin, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Maarten Bosma, Henryk Michalewski, David Dohan, Ellen Jiang, Carrie Cai, Michael Terry, Quoc Le, et al. *Program synthesis with large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732, 2021.

2. **APPS Dataset**:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Saurav Kadavath, Mantas Mazeika, Akul Arora, Ethan Guo, Collin Burns, Samir Puranik, Horace He, Dawn Song, et al. *Measuring coding challenge competence with apps*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.09938, 2021.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
