To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explanation-Guided Fairness Testing through Genetic Algorithm" by Ming Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on "multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets." This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list five datasets:

1. **Census Income Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether an adult's income exceeds $50K. It contains 32,561 samples and 13 features, with protected attributes including gender, age, and race.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset assesses the credit level of applicants based on personal conditions. It consists of 600 samples and 20 features, with protected attributes being gender and age.

3. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: This dataset relates to a marketing campaign of a Portuguese bank, predicting whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit. It has 45,211 samples and 16 features, with age as a protected attribute.

4. **IMDB Dataset**: A large dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 samples, where each sample has an average of 210 words. The protected attributes are gender and country.

5. **SST Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, containing 9,613 samples with an average of 19 words. The protected attributes are the same as those in the IMDB dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Census Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2021. Census Income Dataset. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2021. German Credit Dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data).

- For the **Bank Marketing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2021. Bank Marketing Dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2021. IMDB Dataset. https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/.

- For the **SST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2021. Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset. http://nlpprogress.com/english/sentiment_analysis.html.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
