To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Attention for Slate Markov Decision Processes with High-Dimensional States and Actions" by Peter Sunehag et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to recommendation systems, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In the **experimental comparison section**, the authors mention a "test environment" that consists of environments with varying numbers of states and actions represented by high-dimensional vectors. However, they do not specify any named datasets directly. Instead, they describe the environments as derived from a real recommendation system, which suggests that the data is based on proprietary or specific datasets used in their experiments.

To ensure I have all necessary information, I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or related works that provide datasets. However, it appears that the paper does not provide specific dataset citations, as it focuses more on the methodology and results rather than on publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Test Environment**: The environments used for testing are derived from a real recommendation system, but no specific dataset names or citations are provided.

Given this analysis, I will note that while the paper discusses environments based on real-world data, it lacks explicit dataset citations. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they are not mentioned in the paper. 

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not specify any datasets with full citations, and I will prepare to summarize the findings accordingly.
