To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory Population in Continual Learning via Outlier Elimination" by Julio Hurtado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CORe50**, which suggests these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **CORe50**: A dataset designed for continuous object recognition, consisting of 50 object categories with images captured in various settings.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is part of the same dataset collection:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CORe50**, the citation is:
  > Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni. *Core50: A New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, volume 78 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 17â€“26, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
