To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interference Aware Cooperative Routing for Edge Computing-enabled 5G Networks" by Abdullah Waqas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus more on the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including the challenges in 5G networks, but they do not mention any specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their proposed algorithm and the simulation setup. Here, they mention that they conducted simulations with a network of wireless devices but do not specify any datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion** sections. These sections typically provide insights into the experiments conducted and may reference datasets used for validation. However, upon reviewing these sections, it appears that the authors primarily focus on simulation results rather than empirical data from specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the references mainly consist of literature on routing algorithms and network performance, with no explicit mention of datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or simulations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document them with full citations, following the format used in the references section. This would involve identifying the dataset name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation for each dataset.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that there are no datasets to extract, and thus, no citations to compile.
