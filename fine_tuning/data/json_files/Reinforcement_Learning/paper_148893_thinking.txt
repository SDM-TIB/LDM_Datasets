To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Poisoning Attacks and Defense for General Multi-Class Models Based On Synthetic Reduced Nearest Neighbors" by Pooya Tavallali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed attack and defense techniques but does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets for their experiments, but they do not provide specific names or citations directly in the text. Therefore, I will check the **References section** to find any datasets that might have been cited in the context of previous works or methodologies.

In the references, I will look for papers that describe datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this study. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, or others, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples or classes.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the MNIST dataset, I would include:
- **Name**: MNIST
- **Description**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
- **Full Citation**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are clearly documented and formatted for easy reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
