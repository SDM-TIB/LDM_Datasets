To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Optimization Method-Assisted Ensemble Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm to Solve Unit Commitment Problems" by Jingtao Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical studies on IEEE 118 and 300-bus systems, indicating that these systems may be datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Numerical Studies)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention applying their method to solve a 48-hour period unit commitment problem for the **IEEE 118-bus system** and the **IEEE 300-bus system**. This confirms that these two systems are indeed datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The IEEE test systems are commonly referenced in power systems research, so I will look for authoritative sources that describe these datasets.

For the **IEEE 118-bus system**, the citation is:
> R. D. Zimmerman, C. E. Murillo-Sánchez, and R. J. Thomas. "Matpower: Steady-state operations, planning, and analysis tools for power systems research and education." *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 12-19, 2010.

For the **IEEE 300-bus system**, the citation is typically the same as the 118-bus system since they are part of the same Matpower package:
> R. D. Zimmerman, C. E. Murillo-Sánchez, and R. J. Thomas. "Matpower: Steady-state operations, planning, and analysis tools for power systems research and education." *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 12-19, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
