To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recommendation Systems with Distribution-Free Reliability Guarantees" by Anastasios N. Angelopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on the **Yahoo! Learning to Rank** and **MS MARCO** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the **Yahoo! Learning to Rank dataset** as containing 36,251 Yahoo! search queries, with a subset used for their experiments. They also mention the **MS MARCO dataset**, which consists of 367,013 text queries sampled from Bing, with each query associated with 100 documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Yahoo! Learning to Rank dataset**, the citation is:
   > Olivier Chapelle and Yi Chang. *Yahoo! learning to rank challenge overview*. In Proceedings of the learning to rank challenge, pages 1â€“24. PMLR, 2011.

2. For the **MS MARCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@NIPS, 2016.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and formatting them appropriately for further processing.
