To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning" by Xu-Hui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method (EDIS) on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors evaluate their method. Here, they mention specific environments and datasets used for testing. In particular, they refer to benchmark tasks from **D4RL** (Fu et al., 2020), which is a significant clue that I should look for specific datasets associated with these tasks.

In **Section 5.1**, the authors list several environments where EDIS was evaluated, including:

1. **MuJoCo Locomotion**: This includes tasks like hopper, halfcheetah, and walker2d, which are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.
2. **AntMaze Navigation**: This includes various datasets such as antmaze-umaze-v2 and antmaze-medium-diverse-v2.
3. **Adroit Manipulation**: This includes tasks like pen-human-v1 and door-human-v1.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the D4RL dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used.

The full citation for the D4RL dataset is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., and Levine, S. D4RL: datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. CoRR, abs/2004.07219, 2020.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations:

1. **MuJoCo Locomotion**: This includes several tasks, but the specific datasets are not individually cited in the paper. However, they are part of the D4RL benchmark.
2. **AntMaze Navigation**: Similar to MuJoCo, the specific datasets are part of the D4RL benchmark.
3. **Adroit Manipulation**: The datasets mentioned (e.g., pen-human-v1, door-human-v1) are also part of the D4RL benchmark.

Since the paper does not provide separate citations for each task within the D4RL benchmark, I will reference the D4RL citation for all the datasets mentioned.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

- **MuJoCo Locomotion**: Part of D4RL (Fu et al., 2020).
- **AntMaze Navigation**: Part of D4RL (Fu et al., 2020).
- **Adroit Manipulation**: Part of D4RL (Fu et al., 2020).

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
