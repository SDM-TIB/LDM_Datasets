To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoding Surface Codes with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Policy Reuse" by Elisha Siddiqui Matekole et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it could hint at their existence. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that describe the experimental setup or simulations. This section is likely to detail the datasets used for training and testing the reinforcement learning models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using different environments with varying error probabilities, which suggests that they may have used simulated datasets rather than publicly available datasets. I will need to clarify whether these environments are based on existing datasets or if they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the study.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Environment-0" or "Environment-1," I will need to determine if these are original datasets created by the authors or if they are based on established datasets in the field of quantum error correction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any relevant parameters.

Finally, I will organize the dataset information clearly, ready for further processing or review.
