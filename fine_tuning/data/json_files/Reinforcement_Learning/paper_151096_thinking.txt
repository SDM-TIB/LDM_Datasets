To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search for Partially Observable Multi-agent Pathfinding" by Alexey Skrynnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the problem context and may reference specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **empirical evaluation section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets. This could provide additional context about the datasets used and their relevance to the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Warehouse 46 Ã— 33," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is derived from another work, I will ensure to cite the original paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
