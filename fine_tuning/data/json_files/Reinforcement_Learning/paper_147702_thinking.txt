To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prioritized Experience Replay" by Tom Schaul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of prioritized experience replay in reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be described. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 benchmark suite** for their experiments. This is a well-known collection of games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, which indicates that it is a dataset of sorts.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or experimental setups that might not be detailed in the main sections. The paper mentions a modified version of the **MNIST dataset** for supervised learning experiments, specifically a class-imbalanced variant. This is another dataset that I need to include.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Atari 2600 Benchmark Suite**: This dataset consists of various Atari games used to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms. The authors do not provide a specific citation in the paper, but the original paper describing the benchmark is:
   > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.4708, 2012.

2. **Modified MNIST Dataset**: The authors created a class-imbalanced version of the MNIST dataset for their experiments. The original MNIST dataset citation is:
   > LeCun, Yann, Cortes, Corinna, and Burges, Christopher JC. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I format the information correctly for any downstream processing or review. This includes clearly stating the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.
