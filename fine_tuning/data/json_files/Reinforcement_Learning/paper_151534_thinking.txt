To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strategically Conservative Q-Learning" by Yutaka Shimizu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **D4RL benchmark tasks**, which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will note this as a potential dataset to investigate further.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **D4RL dataset** for their experiments. I will need to gather more details about this dataset, including its components and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation on various tasks using the D4RL dataset. They mention tasks such as **Mujoco locomotion** and **Antmaze tasks**, which are part of the D4RL benchmark. I will confirm that these tasks are indeed part of the dataset and note any specific configurations or splits used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the D4RL dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2021). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=px0-N3_KjA.

Since the D4RL dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the D4RL dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included and accurately represented.
