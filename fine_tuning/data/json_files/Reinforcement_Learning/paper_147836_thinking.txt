To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving" by Sen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of **The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)** as the environment for training the agent, which suggests that this is a key dataset or environment used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. They mention using **TORCS** and provide a table (Table 1) that lists selected sensor inputs from the simulator. This indicates that the dataset consists of various sensor data collected during simulations.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors elaborate on their experimental setup and mention that they conducted experiments in different modes of **TORCS**. They describe the training and evaluation processes, which further confirms that **TORCS** is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for **TORCS**. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for TORCS itself, as it is a well-known simulator in the field. Therefore, I will reference the original TORCS documentation or website for the citation.

The citation for **TORCS** is:
> TORCS: The Open Racing Car Simulator. Available at: http://torcs.sourceforge.net/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the use of **TORCS** and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)**: A synthetic driving simulator used for training reinforcement learning agents in autonomous driving tasks.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for **TORCS** with the appropriate citation.
