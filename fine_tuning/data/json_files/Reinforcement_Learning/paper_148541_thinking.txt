To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Based Handwritten Digit Recognition with Two-State Q-Learning" by Abdul Mueed Hafiz and Ghulam Mohiuddin Bhat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "three datasets have been used for benchmarking of the approach," which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction mentions handwritten digit recognition and references various techniques, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experimentation** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly list three datasets: **MNIST**, **USPS**, and **MATLAB Digit Image Dataset**. This confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > LeCun Y, Bottou L, Bengio Y, Haffner P (1998) Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE 86 (11):2278-2324.

2. **USPS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > USPS Handwritten Digit Dataset. Available at: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html.

3. **MATLAB Digit Image Dataset**: The citation is:
   > MATLAB(R) (2017) MATLAB Digit Image Dataset.

Now that I have the names and citations for each dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
