To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action Candidate Based Clipped Double Q-learning for Discrete and Continuous Action Tasks" by Haobo Jiang, Jin Xie, and Jian Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the research.

In the **abstract**, I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors may discuss the datasets in relation to their methodology or previous work, which can provide context for their selection.

Then, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will identify the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Dhariwal, P., Hesse, C., Klimov, O., Nichol, A., Plappert, M., Radford, A., Schulman, J., Sidor, S., Wu, Y., and Zhokhov, P. (2017). OpenAI baselines.

If they mention any specific datasets like **MinAtar**, I will also find its citation:
> Young, K., and Tian, T. (2019). MinAtar: An Atari-inspired Testbed for More Efficient Reinforcement Learning Experiments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract for any mentions of datasets.
2. Review the introduction for context and specific dataset mentions.
3. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset mentioned.
5. Compile the dataset information and citations for clarity and accessibility.
