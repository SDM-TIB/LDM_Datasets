To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Two-stage Thermal History Prediction Method for Metal Additive Manufacturing of Thin Walls" by Yifan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous work and may reference datasets used in those studies. This could provide context for the datasets they are using in their own research.

In the **methods section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets or data collection. This section typically outlines the experimental setup and the specific datasets used for training and testing the models. The authors mention conducting **fifteen wire arc AM experiments** and **nine simulations**. I will note the details of these experiments, including any specific datasets generated from them.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from previous studies or established datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the following details for each dataset:
1. **Dataset Name**: A clear and concise name for the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I identify a dataset from the experiments, I might document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: CMT-WAAM Experimental Data
- **Description**: Data collected from fifteen wire arc additive manufacturing experiments, including temperature profiles and process parameters.
- **Full Citation**: Tang Y, Balani SB, Dhalpe A, Dehaghani MR, Panicker S, Coatanea E, et al. Layer-to-Layer Thermal History Prediction for Thin Walls in Metal Additive Manufacturing. Int. Des. Eng. Tech. Conf. Comput. Inf. Eng. Conf., Boston, MA, American: 2023.

After compiling all the datasets, I will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for anyone looking to understand or utilize the datasets in their own research.
