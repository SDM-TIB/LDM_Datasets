To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multimodal Fusion of Data with Heterogeneous Dimensionality via Projective Networks" by Jos√© Morano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework was validated on tasks related to segmentation of geographic atrophy (GA) and retinal blood vessels (RBV) in multimodal retinal imaging, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly the **Experimental Setup** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two in-house datasets:

1. **Geographic Atrophy Dataset**: This dataset consists of 967 OCT volumetric scans from 100 patients (184 eyes) with GA. It includes OCT B-Scans, SLO, and FAF images, with GA en-face masks annotated by retinal experts.

2. **Retinal Blood Vessel Dataset**: This dataset contains 33 OCT volumes and SLO images from 33 patients with AMD. The scans were also captured using a Spectralis OCT device, and the annotations were performed by retinal experts.

I will then check the **References** section to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are in-house and not publicly available, I will note that they do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

Now, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- For the **Geographic Atrophy Dataset**, I will include a description of its contents, the number of patients, and the imaging modalities used. I will note that it is an in-house dataset and does not have a formal citation.

- For the **Retinal Blood Vessel Dataset**, I will similarly describe its contents, the number of patients, and the imaging modalities used, also noting that it is an in-house dataset without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, ensuring that I emphasize the lack of formal citations for the in-house datasets.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by focusing on the relevant sections of the paper, summarizing their details, and noting the absence of formal citations for in-house datasets.
