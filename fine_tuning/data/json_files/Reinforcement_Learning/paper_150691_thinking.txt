To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Connection between Game-Theoretic Feature Attributions and Counterfactual Explanations" by Shubham Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three publicly available datasets:

1. **HELOC (Home Equity Line Of Credit)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed methods in the context of credit risk evaluation.

2. **Lending Club (Loan Data)**: This dataset is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the explanations generated by their methods in the context of loan data.

3. **Adult (1994 U.S. Census Income)**: This dataset is employed to analyze the performance of the proposed methods in predicting income based on census data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **HELOC**, the citation is:
  > FICO Community. 2019. Explainable Machine Learning Challenge.

- For **Lending Club**, the citation is:
  > Lending Club. 2019. Lending Club Loans.

- For **Adult**, the citation is:
  > Becker, Barry. 1994. Adult Dataset: Extract of 1994 U.S. Income Census.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing full citations for each to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
