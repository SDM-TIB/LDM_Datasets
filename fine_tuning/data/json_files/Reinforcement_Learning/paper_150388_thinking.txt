To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the effect of varying amounts of replay per step" by Animesh Kumar Paul and Videh Raj Nema, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a model-free algorithm, specifically the Deep Q-Network (DQN), in the Mountain Car environment, which suggests that there may be a dataset or environment used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors describe their setup. They mention evaluating DQN in the **Mountain Car environment**, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. This indicates that the dataset or environment is the Mountain Car simulation itself, rather than a traditional dataset with labeled data.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the Mountain Car environment. The authors reference the OpenAI Gym implementation of the Mountain Car environment, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. OpenAI Gym, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

Since the Mountain Car environment is part of the OpenAI Gym, I will include this citation as it provides the necessary context for the dataset used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset/environment used in the research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the Mountain Car environment from OpenAI Gym, and I will document it accordingly.
