To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Model Reprogramming with Similarity Based Mapping for Low-Resource Spoken Command Classification" by Hao Yen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their system on three low-resource spoken command recognition datasets: **Arabic**, **Lithuanian**, and **dysarthric Mandarin speech**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Lithuanian Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings from 28 speakers, each pronouncing 20 words. The authors mention that they follow the settings from previous works, which indicates a structured approach to dataset preparation.

2. **Dysarthric Mandarin Speech Commands Dataset**: This dataset contains 19 Mandarin commands, each uttered 10 times by 3 dysarthric patients. The authors provide details about the sampling rate and the number of recordings, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

3. **Arabic Speech Commands Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of 16 commands, with a total of 1600 utterances recorded from 40 speakers. They also mention the sampling rate and the split between training and testing data.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Lithuanian Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aliaksei Kolesau and Dmitrij Å esok. *Voice activation for low-resource languages*. Applied Sciences, vol. 11, no. 14, 2021.

- For the **Dysarthric Mandarin Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Yi Lin et al. *A speech command control-based recognition system for dysarthric patients based on deep learning technology*. Applied Sciences, vol. 11, no. 6, 2021.

- For the **Arabic Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lina Benamer and Osama Alkishriwo. *Database for Arabic speech commands recognition*. In Proc. CEST, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
