To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privileged to Predicted: Towards Sensorimotor Reinforcement Learning for Urban Driving" by Ege Onat Özsüer, Barış Akgün, and Fatma Güney, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA simulation environment for evaluation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments and evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the CARLA AD Challenge, which indicates that the CARLA simulator is a key component of their research. I will check if they provide details about any datasets collected or used during their experiments.

In the **data collection section**, the authors state that they collected 20 hours of driving data at 10 Hertz using the CARLA autopilot in the ROACH RL environment. This indicates that they have created a dataset from their experiments. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the towns used and the validation split.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the CARLA simulator or other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the CARLA simulator, which is a well-known dataset in the field of autonomous driving.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **CARLA Driving Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 hours of driving data collected from towns 1 through 6 of the CARLA simulator, reserved 10% for validation. The dataset includes various driving scenarios and conditions.

For the full citation of the CARLA simulator, I will refer to the original paper:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
