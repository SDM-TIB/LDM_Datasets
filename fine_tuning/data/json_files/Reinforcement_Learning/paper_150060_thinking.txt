To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAN: Multi-Action Networks Learning" by Keqin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section V)**, where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their method on. They mention three scenarios: an n-dimensional maze task, a block stacking task, and Atari games. I need to determine if these tasks are associated with specific datasets or if they are original experiments designed by the authors.

In the **n-dimensional maze task**, the authors describe the setup but do not reference an external dataset. Instead, they define the task parameters and the action space, indicating that this is a custom experimental setup.

For the **block stacking task**, the authors again describe the task and its parameters without citing an external dataset. This suggests that the task is also original and does not rely on a pre-existing dataset.

In the **Atari game-playing section**, the authors mention using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) to evaluate their method. This is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and I need to ensure I provide the correct citation for it.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since the other tasks (n-dimensional maze and block stacking) do not reference external datasets, I will only include the citation for the ALE in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Arcade Learning Environment, ensuring that it is clearly documented and ready for any downstream processing or review.
