To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Machine Learning Classifiers through Diverse Counterfactual Explanations" by Ramaravind K. Mothilal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluating Counterfactuals)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Adult-Income Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic and educational information based on the 1994 Census database. The authors state that it is available on the UCI machine learning repository.

2. **LendingClub Dataset**: This dataset includes five years of loan data from LendingClub, detailing various features related to loans and borrowers.

3. **German-Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of information about individuals who took loans from a bank, and it is also available on the UCI machine learning repository.

4. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset was collected by ProPublica and is used for analyzing recidivism decisions in the United States.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are as follows:

- For the **Adult-Income Dataset**:
  > Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. 1996. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.

- For the **LendingClub Dataset**:
  > Lending Club Statistics. https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.

- For the **German-Credit Dataset**:
  > Accessed 2019. German credit dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/support/statlog+(german+credit+data).

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, and Lauren Kirchner. 2016. “Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks”. https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
