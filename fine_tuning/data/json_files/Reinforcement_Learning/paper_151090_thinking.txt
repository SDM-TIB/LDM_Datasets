To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CVA Hedging by Risk-Averse Stochastic-Horizon Reinforcement Learning" by R. Daluiso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for numerical studies or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their numerical studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, the authors mention that they simulate data for the risk drivers, specifically the FX rate and the default intensity. They describe the generation of these datasets in detail, which indicates that they are indeed using simulated datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the study.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **FX Rate Dataset**: The authors simulate the FX rate using a Geometric Brownian Motion model. While they do not provide a specific dataset name, they describe the simulation process in detail.

2. **Default Intensity Dataset**: The authors simulate the default intensity using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. Similar to the FX rate, this dataset is generated through simulation rather than being sourced from an existing dataset.

Since these datasets are generated through simulation rather than being sourced from external datasets, I will note that in the output. However, I will still provide a citation for the methods used to generate these datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant citations for the methods used to generate the datasets:

- For the FX Rate Dataset, I will cite:
  > Brigo, D. and Mercurio, F. *Interest Rate Models - Theory and Practice*. Springer Finance, 2013.

- For the Default Intensity Dataset, I will cite:
  > Cox, J.C., Ingersoll, J.E. and Ross, S.A. *A Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates*. Econometrica, 1985.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets used in the research paper.
