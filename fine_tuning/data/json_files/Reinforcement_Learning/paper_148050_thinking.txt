To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Quantum Circuits for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Samuel Yen-Chi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of environments like "frozen-lake" and "cognitive-radio," as these are likely to be the datasets or environments used for testing the proposed methods.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their specific characteristics, such as the number of states, actions, and any relevant parameters that define their structure. 

After gathering the necessary information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the authoritative source for the datasets used in the research. 

For example, if the paper mentions the "frozen-lake" environment, I will look for its original source or any relevant papers that describe it in detail. Similarly, for the "cognitive-radio" environment, I will find the original reference that discusses its implementation and characteristics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clearly documented for future reference. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets used in the research paper.
