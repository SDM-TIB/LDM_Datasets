To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balanced Q-learning: Combining the Influence of Optimistic and Pessimistic Targets" by Thommen George Karimpanal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to benchmark environments or datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

In this paper, the authors mention using various environments for their experiments, including the MinAtar environments. I will look for specific names of these environments and any associated datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
