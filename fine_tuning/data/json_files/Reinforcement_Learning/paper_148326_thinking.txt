To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Stochastic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning" by Nhan H. Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may highlight specific datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that explicitly mention datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to reinforcement learning tasks, as the title suggests that the research focuses on policy gradient algorithms in this domain. I will also note any specific characteristics of the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or any unique features that are relevant to the study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics in the experiments section.
3. Locate full citations for each dataset in the references section.
4. Compile the information into a structured format, ensuring all citations are included.
