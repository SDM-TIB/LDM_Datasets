To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Investigation of Hepatitis B Virus Genome using Markov Models" by Khadijeh (Hoda) Jahanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methodologies, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses previous research and may reference specific datasets or sources of data.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of full genome HBV sequences from a diverse range of naturally infected patients. This suggests that there is a dataset related to HBV sequences, but I need to find the specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or methods** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using **3,000 human HBV normal sequences from NCBI** and **901 HBV hypermutated sequences from Vartanian et al.** This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **experimental section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors specify that they used **2,047 full genome HIV-1 sequences** from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **HBV normal sequences**: The authors state that they used 3,000 human HBV normal sequences downloaded from NCBI. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is a public database. I will note that it is from NCBI.

2. **HBV hypermutated sequences**: The citation for the dataset used is:
   > Vartanian, J.P., Henry, M., Marchio, A., Suspène, R., Aynaud, M.M., Guétard, D., Cervantes-Gonzalez, M., Battiston, C., Mazzaferro, V., Pineau, P., and Dejean, A. (2010). *Massive APOBEC3 editing of hepatitis B viral DNA in cirrhosis*. PLoS pathogens, 6(5), e1000928.

3. **HIV-1 sequences**: The citation for the HIV-1 dataset is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is sourced from the LANL database. I will note that it is from the LANL database, but since specific accession numbers are mentioned, I will include that information as well.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: 3,000 human HBV normal sequences from NCBI (no specific citation).
- **Dataset 2**: 901 HBV hypermutated sequences from Vartanian et al. (2010).
- **Dataset 3**: 2,047 full genome HIV-1 sequences from the LANL database (specific accession numbers provided in the paper).

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its citation for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively.
