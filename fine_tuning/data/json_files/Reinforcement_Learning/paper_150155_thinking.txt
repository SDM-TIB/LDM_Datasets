To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep reinforcement learning for automatic run-time adaptation of UWB PHY radio settings" by Dieter Coppens et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may indicate whether datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the data collection process. In this paper, the authors mention that they collected a UWB dataset in a realistic environment using 72 different UWB PHY settings, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of the dataset in the methodology or experimental setup. In this case, the authors describe the dataset gathered using a specific hardware platform (Wi-PoS) and detail the parameters used during the data collection, including the number of nodes and the nature of the experiments.

The authors also provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. I will ensure to note this link as it allows others to access the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the references provided in the paper. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **UWB dataset**:

De Poorter. *Wi-PoS: A low-cost, open source ultra-wideband (UWB) hardware platform with long range sub-GHz backbone*. Sensors, vol. 19, no. 7, 2019. Available: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/7/1548

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, including its purpose, the number of settings tested, and the nature of the data collected, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future reference.
