To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Value Functions and the Agent-Environment Boundary" by Nan Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implications of function approximation in reinforcement learning but does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments and case study sections** for any references to datasets used in the research. In the introduction, the authors reference the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as a benchmark for their analysis, which indicates that there may be datasets associated with this environment.

In the **case study section**, the authors mention a dataset denoted as **D = {(si, ai, ri)}**, where the tuples represent state, action, and reward. This dataset is used in the context of contextual bandits, but it is not a publicly available dataset; rather, it is a representation of the data structure used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references include various foundational papers in reinforcement learning, but they do not provide specific datasets. However, the paper does reference the **Arcade Learning Environment** which is a well-known dataset in the field.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a widely used benchmark in reinforcement learning research, providing a set of Atari games for evaluating algorithms. The citation for the ALE is:
   > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. **Contextual Bandit Dataset**: The dataset described as **D = {(si, ai, ri)}** is a conceptual dataset used for the analysis in the paper, but it does not correspond to a publicly available dataset. Therefore, it does not have a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the **Arcade Learning Environment** as the primary dataset referenced in the paper, along with its citation. The contextual bandit dataset is an internal representation used for analysis and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant information and citations.
