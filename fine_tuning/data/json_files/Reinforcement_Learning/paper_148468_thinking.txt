To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logical Team Q-learning: An approach towards factored policies in cooperative MARL" by Lucas Cassano and Ali H. Sayed, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the methodologies used, including any datasets employed in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive details about each dataset used in the research. I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or features of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Atari Learning Environment," I would look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I may need to search for the original source or publication that introduced the dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
