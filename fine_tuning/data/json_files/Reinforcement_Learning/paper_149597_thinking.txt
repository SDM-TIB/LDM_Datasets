To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-as-a-Service Toolkit for Human-Centered Intelligence in Autonomous Driving" by Valerio De Caro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions a data-gathering subsystem that collects data from various sensors, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the TEACHING project and its goals. They mention the use of physiological signals for identifying drivers' cognitive states, which may indicate the presence of relevant datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsections discussing the physiological and visual data, I will look for specific datasets that are used for stress detection and facial behavior analysis. The authors mention using the **WESAD dataset** for training an Echo State Network (ESN) to recognize stress levels. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The WESAD dataset is likely referenced in the context of physiological data analysis, and I will ensure to extract its citation accurately.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **WESAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for stress detection through physiological signals. It is specifically mentioned in the context of training the ESN model.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the WESAD dataset in the references section. If it is not directly cited, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced the WESAD dataset to ensure I provide an accurate citation.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper accurately and comprehensively.
