To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Root Cause Localization and Anomaly Mitigation through Causal Inference" by Xiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in the **Experiments** section. They mention three datasets:

1. **Loan Dataset**: This is a semi-synthetic dataset derived from the German Credit dataset, consisting of 7 endogenous features related to loan approval scenarios. The authors reference the original dataset in their description.

2. **Adult Dataset**: Another semi-synthetic dataset derived from the real-world Adult dataset, containing 10 endogenous features related to annual income. The authors also refer to the original dataset in their description.

3. **Donors Dataset**: This is a real-world dataset aimed at predicting whether a project on DonorsChoose.org is exciting to the business. The authors provide a brief overview of the features involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Loan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. 2017. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)).

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. 2017. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

- For the **Donors Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. 2014. *KDD Cup 2014: Predicting Excitement at DonorsChoose*. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
