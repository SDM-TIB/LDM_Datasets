To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Time Analysis for Double Q-learning" by Huaqing Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to reinforcement learning or Q-learning, as the focus of the research is on double Q-learning. If the authors refer to any standard datasets or benchmarks, I will note those down.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Atari 2600 games" for their experiments, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset in detail. The citation might look something like this:

- For the Atari 2600 games dataset, the citation could be:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., Graves, A., Riedmiller, M., Fidjeland, A. K., Ostrovski, G., et al. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. *Nature*, 518(7540), 529-533.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper attribution.
