To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal and Fast Real-time Resources Slicing with Deep Dueling Neural Networks" by Nguyen Van Huynh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of simulations to evaluate their proposed framework. I will look for any references to specific datasets or simulation environments that were used to validate their approach. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "5G Network Slicing Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain accuracy and completeness in the information extracted.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
