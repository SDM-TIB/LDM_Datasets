To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State-Separated SARSA: A Practical Sequential Decision-Making Algorithm with Recovering Rewards" by Yuto Tanimoto and Kenji Fukumizu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of multi-armed bandit algorithms but do not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to the **experiments section**, which typically contains information about the datasets used for simulations.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors describe their simulation settings, including the parameters and metrics used. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide references to specific datasets. Instead, they describe the simulation environments and the parameters set for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. The references include various papers related to multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning, but they do not provide specific datasets used in this research.

Since the paper does not mention any specific datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses simulation settings and parameters, it does not provide any explicit datasets or citations for datasets used in the experiments. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile.
