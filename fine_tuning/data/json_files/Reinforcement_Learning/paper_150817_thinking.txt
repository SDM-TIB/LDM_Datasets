To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Estimation of Data Uncertainty for Surveillance Face Anti-spoofing" by Mouxiao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on a dataset called **SuHiFiMask**, which indicates that this is a key dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they describe **SuHiFiMask** in detail, including its composition and the types of scenarios it covers. The dataset consists of 40 real-life surveillance scenes with a total of 159,063 training images, 89,276 development images, and 161,882 test images. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SuHiFiMask** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Fang H, Liu A, Wan J, et al. *Surveillance Face Anti-spoofing*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00975, 2023.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details for **SuHiFiMask**:
- **Dataset Name**: SuHiFiMask
- **Description**: A large-scale dataset for face anti-spoofing in surveillance scenarios, consisting of 40 real-life scenes and various types of spoofing attacks.
- **Number of Images**: 159,063 training images, 89,276 development images, and 161,882 test images.
- **Types of Spoofing Attacks**: High-fidelity masks, 2D attacks, and adversarial attacks.
- **Collection Conditions**: Captured under realistic outdoor conditions with diverse weather and lighting situations.

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to present the dataset in the required format, focusing on clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset's significance in the context of the research.
