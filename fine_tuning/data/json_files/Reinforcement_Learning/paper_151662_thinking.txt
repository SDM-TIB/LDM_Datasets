To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Distribution of Treatment Effects: A Covariate-Adjustment Approach" by Bruno Fava, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. In this paper, the author discusses revisiting five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in microcredit, which suggests that there are specific datasets associated with these studies.

In the **results section**, the author provides a table (Table 2) that summarizes the datasets used in the analysis. This table includes important details such as the country of the study, year of implementation, treated/control observations, number of covariates, average loan size, and average household income at endline.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Bosnia Microcredit Dataset**: 
   - Year of implementation: 2009
   - Treated/control observations: 551/444
   - Number of covariates: 48
   - Average loan size in treatment group: $609
   - Average household income at endline: $1,389
   - Citation: Augsburg, B., De Haas, R., Harmgart, H., & Meghir, C. (2015). *The impacts of microcredit: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina*. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 7, 183–203.

2. **Egypt Microcredit Dataset**: 
   - Year of implementation: 2016
   - Treated/control observations: 477/478
   - Number of covariates: 97
   - Average loan size in treatment group: $1,224
   - Average household income at endline: $9,912
   - Citation: Karlan, D., & Zinman, J. (2011). *Microcredit in theory and practice: Using randomized credit scoring for impact evaluation*. Science, 332, 1278–1284.

3. **Philippines (1) Microcredit Dataset**: 
   - Year of implementation: 2006
   - Treated/control observations: 891/222
   - Number of covariates: 24
   - Average loan size in treatment group: $1,374
   - Average household income at endline: $1,045
   - Citation: Karlan, D., & Zinman, J. (2010). *Expanding credit access: Using randomized supply decisions to estimate the impacts*. The Review of Financial Studies, 23, 433–464.

4. **Philippines (2) Microcredit Dataset**: 
   - Year of implementation: 2010
   - Treated/control observations: 1651/313
   - Number of covariates: 39
   - Average loan size in treatment group: $110
   - Average household income at endline: $492
   - Citation: Karlan, D., & Zinman, J. (2011). *Microcredit in theory and practice: Using randomized credit scoring for impact evaluation*. Science, 332, 1278–1284.

5. **South Africa Microcredit Dataset**: 
   - Year of implementation: 2004
   - Treated/control observations: 235/313
   - Number of covariates: 33
   - Average loan size in treatment group: -$520 (indicating a negative effect)
   - Average household income at endline: $180
   - Citation: Bryan, G. T., Karlan, D., & Osman, A. (2021). *Big loans to small businesses: Predicting winners and losers in an entrepreneurial lending experiment*. National Bureau of Economic Research.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
