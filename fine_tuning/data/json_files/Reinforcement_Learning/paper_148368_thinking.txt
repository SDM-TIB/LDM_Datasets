To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Robustness on In- and Out-Distribution Improves Explainability" by Maximilian Augustin, Alexander Meinke, and Matthias Hein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **CIFAR10, SVHN, CIFAR100, and restricted ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
4. **Restricted ImageNet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, which contains images from various classes.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations I find will be crucial for proper attribution.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **SVHN**:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NeurIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **Restricted ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured manner. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their sources.
