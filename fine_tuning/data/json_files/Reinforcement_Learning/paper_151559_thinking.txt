To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teleporter Theory: A General and Simple Approach for Modeling Cross-World Counterfactual Causality" by Jiangmeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it discusses the theoretical contributions, it may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Practical Application of Teleporter Theory)**, as this section discusses the application of the proposed theory and is likely to mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention two benchmarks: **GOOD** and **DrugOOD**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets:

1. **GOOD Dataset**: This dataset is tailored specifically for graph out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, focusing on molecular data for binary classification tasks. The authors mention that it includes a dataset for predicting whether a molecule can inhibit HIV.

2. **DrugOOD Dataset**: This dataset is designed for AI-aided drug discovery, providing measurements such as IC50 and EC50 across various environmental conditions. The authors specify that it includes multiple datasets based on different splitting strategies (assay, scaffold, size).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For the **GOOD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shurui Gui, Xiner Li, Limei Wang, and Shuiwang Ji. *Good: A graph out-of-distribution benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:2059–2073, 2022.

- For the **DrugOOD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuanfeng Ji, Lu Zhang, Jiaxiang Wu, Bingzhe Wu, Long-Kai Huang, Tingyang Xu, Yu Rong, Lanqing Li, Jie Ren, Ding Xue, et al. *Drugood: Out-of-distribution (ood) dataset curator and benchmark for ai-aided drug discovery–a focus on affinity prediction problems with noise annotations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.09637, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
