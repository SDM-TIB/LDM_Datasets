To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shared Interest: Measuring Human-AI Alignment to Identify Recurring Patterns in Model Behavior" by Angie Boggust et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Shared Interest Method)** and **section 3.2 (Experimental Setup)**, as these sections typically detail the datasets used in experiments. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In section 3.2, the authors mention using the **ISIC 2016 Challenge dataset** for melanoma classification, which includes lesion images and segmentations. They also refer to the **BeerAdvocate dataset**, which contains beer reviews annotated with scores and aspect-level annotations.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **ISIC 2016 Challenge dataset**:
   > Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., Celebi, M. E., Dusza, S., Gutman, D., Helba, B., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Marchetti, M., Kittler, H., & Halpern, A. (2019). Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). arXiv:1902.03368 [cs.CV].

2. For the **BeerAdvocate dataset**:
   > Lei, T., Barzilay, R., & Jaakkola, T. S. (2016). Rationalizing Neural Predictions. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 107â€“117.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and understanding of the study's findings.
