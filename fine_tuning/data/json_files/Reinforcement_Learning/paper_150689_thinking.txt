To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power Loss Minimization of Distribution Network using Different Grid Strategies" by Umar Jamil, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a summary of the research, and it may contain references to datasets used for simulations or analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the data used for load flow analysis. In this section, the author mentions various types of data required for load flow studies, such as system data, generator bus data, load data, transmission line data, transformer data, and shunt element data. This indicates that specific datasets are utilized in the research.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any specific datasets are referenced when discussing the outcomes of the simulations. The author may provide details about the datasets used in the simulations, including their sources or any modifications made to them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions the **IEEE-30 Bus System** as a dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for the IEEE-30 Bus System is:
> "Power Systems Test Case Archive. University of Washington. Website: http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca."

If the paper includes other datasets, such as specific data tables or figures, I will ensure to document those as well, including their citations.

Finally, I will compile all identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized effectively in future research or applications.
