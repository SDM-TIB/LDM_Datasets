To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception under Lossy Communication" by Jinlong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **OPV2V dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **OPV2V dataset** in the **experiments section**. The authors describe it as a large-scale open-source simulated dataset for V2V perception, containing 73 divergent scenes, 11,464 frames, and 232,913 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OPV2V dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xu, R., Xiang, H., Xia, X., Han, X., Li, J., & Ma, J. (2022). OPV2V: An open benchmark dataset and fusion pipeline for perception with vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In *International Conference on Robotics and Automation* (pp. 2583â€“2589). IEEE.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **digital-twin CARLA simulator** as the environment used to generate the OPV2V dataset, but they do not mention any other datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. The OPV2V dataset will be the only entry since it is the primary dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
