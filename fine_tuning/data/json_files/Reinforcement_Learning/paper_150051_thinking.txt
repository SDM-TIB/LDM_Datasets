To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Genetic Quantum Annealing Algorithm" by Steven A. Abel, Luca A. Nutricati, and Michael Spannowsky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. If the authors describe experiments or evaluations, they may reference specific datasets used for testing their algorithm. 

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Taxicab numbers" in the context of their experiments, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
