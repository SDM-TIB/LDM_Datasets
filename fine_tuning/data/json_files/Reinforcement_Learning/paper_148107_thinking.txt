To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Getting Gender Right in Neural Machine Translation" by Eva Vanmassenhove et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the compilation of large datasets with speaker information for 20 language pairs, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Compilation of Datasets)**, where the authors describe their efforts to create annotated parallel datasets. They specifically mention that they published a collection of parallel corpora licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for 20 language pairs. This section is crucial as it likely contains the names and details of the datasets.

The authors reference the **Europarl dataset** as the source from which they derived their annotated datasets. They tagged parallel sentences from Europarl with speaker information, which is essential for their experiments. 

In **Table 1**, the paper provides an overview of the annotated parallel sentences per language pair, which includes:

- **EN–FR** (English to French)
- **EN–DE** (English to German)
- **EN–ES** (English to Spanish)
- **EN–IT** (English to Italian)
- **EN–PT** (English to Portuguese)
- **EN–NL** (English to Dutch)
- **EN–DA** (English to Danish)
- **EN–SV** (English to Swedish)
- **EN–FI** (English to Finnish)
- **EN–EL** (English to Greek)
- **EN–BG** (English to Bulgarian)
- **EN–CS** (English to Czech)
- **EN–HU** (English to Hungarian)
- **EN–RO** (English to Romanian)
- **EN–SK** (English to Slovak)
- **EN–SL** (English to Slovenian)
- **EN–ET** (English to Estonian)
- **EN–LT** (English to Lithuanian)
- **EN–LV** (English to Latvian)
- **EN–PL** (English to Polish)

Now, I will look for the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the Europarl dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine translation. The citation for the Europarl dataset is:

- **Europarl Dataset**:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In MT Summit, volume 5, pages 79–86, Phuket, Thailand, 2005.

Additionally, the authors mention their own work in compiling the datasets with demographic speaker information:

- **Vanmassenhove and Hardmeier (2018)**:
  > Eva Vanmassenhove and Christian Hardmeier. *Europarl Datasets with Demographic Speaker Information*. In EAMT, Alicante, Spain, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
