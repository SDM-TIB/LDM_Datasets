To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deeper Look at Experience Replay" by Shangtong Zhang and Richard S. Sutton, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of experience replay in deep reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe the testbeds used for evaluation. Here, they mention three specific tasks: **GridWorld**, **Lunar Lander**, and **Atari Pong**. Each of these tasks serves as a testbed for their algorithms, and I need to gather more details about these environments.

In the **Testbeds section**, the authors provide descriptions of each task:
1. **GridWorld**: A simple grid-based environment where the agent learns to reach a goal while avoiding walls.
2. **Lunar Lander**: A physics-based simulation task where the agent must land a spacecraft on the moon.
3. **Atari Pong**: A classic arcade game where the agent plays against an opponent.

While these tasks are not traditional datasets in the sense of labeled data collections, they are environments that provide the necessary data for training and evaluation of the algorithms discussed in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these environments. The authors reference several foundational works related to reinforcement learning and experience replay, but they do not provide specific citations for the environments themselves. However, I can still document the environments based on their common usage in the field:

- **GridWorld**: This is a well-known environment in reinforcement learning literature, often used for educational purposes.
- **Lunar Lander**: The environment is based on the Box2D physics engine, which is widely cited in reinforcement learning research.
- **Atari Pong**: This environment is part of the Arcade Learning Environment, which is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning studies.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the environments where applicable.

For the **GridWorld**, I will note that it is a standard environment without a specific citation. For **Lunar Lander**, I will reference the Box2D physics engine, and for **Atari Pong**, I will reference the Arcade Learning Environment.

The citations I will include are:
- For **Lunar Lander**:
  > Catto, E. (2011). Box2D: A 2D physics engine for games.
  
- For **Atari Pong**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253â€“279.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for datasets, ensuring that I include the full citations for each environment as needed.
