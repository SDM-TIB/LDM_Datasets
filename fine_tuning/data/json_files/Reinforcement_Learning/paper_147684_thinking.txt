To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opponent Modeling in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by He He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating models on a simulated soccer game and a trivia game, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their models on. They mention two specific tasks: a simulated two-player soccer game and a quiz bowl trivia game. I will look for any details about the datasets used for these tasks.

In the **soccer game section**, the authors describe the game mechanics and the implementation details, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset. However, they do refer to the opponent's behavior and strategies, which implies that they may have used simulated data for training and evaluation.

In the **quiz bowl section**, the authors state that they collected question/answer pairs and logged user buzzes from Protobowl, an online multi-player quiz bowl application. They also reference data from Boyd-Graber et al. (2012). This indicates that there are specific datasets used for this task.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Soccer Game Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the soccer game, as it appears to be a simulated environment rather than a dataset derived from real-world data.

2. **Quiz Bowl Dataset**: The authors mention that they collected data from Protobowl, which includes:
   - 37,700 questions
   - 1,045 answers
   - 3,610 users

For the full citation of the dataset referenced from Boyd-Graber et al. (2012), I will look in the references section. The citation is:
   > Boyd-Graber, Jordan, Satinoff, Brianna, He, He, and Daum√© III, Hal. *Besting the quiz master: Crowdsourcing incremental classification games*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2012.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- For the **soccer game**, there is no formal dataset citation as it is a simulated environment.
- For the **quiz bowl**, the dataset is derived from Protobowl and includes user interactions, with the citation for the related work being Boyd-Graber et al. (2012).

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
