To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Offshore Wind Farm Bidding" by David L. Cole et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the methods and results sections for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of integrating renewable energy systems into power markets, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methods section** where they describe the reinforcement learning framework and the data used for training the agent.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention that the environment consisted of "real price and wind production data" sourced from the New England ISO and another dataset for wind production data. They specifically reference two sources:

1. **New England ISO**: This dataset includes real-time (RT) and day-ahead (DA) price data for the northeastern United States.
2. **Grothe et al. (2022)**: This dataset contains 40 years of hourly wind speeds and electricity production data from Europe’s biggest offshore wind farms.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **New England ISO dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISO New England Inc. (2023). Selectable day-ahead and preliminary real-time hourly LMPs. https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/pricing/-/tree/lmp-by-node. Accessed 9-22-2023.

- For the **wind production dataset**, the citation is:
  > Grothe, O., Kächele, F., & Watermeyer, M. (2022). Analyzing Europe’s biggest offshore wind farms: a data set with 40 years of hourly wind speeds and electricity production. *Energies*, 15(5), 1700.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their sources.
