To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Secure and Efficient Data Scheduling for Vehicular Social Networks" by Youhua Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of data transmission in vehicular networks and mention the need for efficient data scheduling. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **KITTI** and **NuScenes** datasets for simulation analysis. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012. [Available at: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/index.php]

2. For the **NuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and V. S. M. K. A. *NuScenes: A Large-Scale Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020. [Available at: https://www.nuscenes.org/]

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **KITTI Dataset**: A dataset for various computer vision tasks, including stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, and 3D object detection, specifically designed for autonomous driving research.
- **NuScenes Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving that includes 3D sensor data and annotations for various driving scenarios.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
