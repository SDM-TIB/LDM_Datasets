To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Models of Individual Behavior in Chess" by Reid McIlroy-Young et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "an enormous corpus of recorded data on individual player games," which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Background)**, where the authors describe their data sources and dataset construction. Here, they specifically mention using data from **Lichess**, the largest open-source online chess platform, which provides a significant amount of game data.

In this section, the authors detail their dataset construction process, including the criteria for selecting players based on the number of games played and rating. They mention that they collected a dataset containing all rated games played on Lichess between January 2013 and December 2020. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors discuss the performance of their models on various player sets, but they primarily refer to the datasets constructed from Lichess data.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Lichess Dataset**: The citation for the Lichess data is:
   > Duplessis, T. Lichess. lichess.org, 2021. Accessed: 2021-01-01.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or provide additional citations, I will focus on documenting the Lichess dataset as the primary dataset used in their research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Lichess dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.
