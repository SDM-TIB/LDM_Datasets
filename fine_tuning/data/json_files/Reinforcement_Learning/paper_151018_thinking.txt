To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Distribution Balancing for Counterfactual Reasoning" by Stefan Schrod et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on "three benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **IHDP Dataset**: This dataset is based on a randomized trial conducted by the Infant Health Development Program, which studies the impact of specialist child care on infants with low birth weight. The dataset includes 25 clinical parameters and 747 infants, with specific treatment assignments.

2. **NEWS Dataset**: This dataset models reader opinions of 5000 news articles from the New York Times based on the viewing device (desktop or mobile). Each article is described by a word count vector of 3477 individual words.

3. **ACIC2016 Dataset**: This dataset was designed for the 2016 Atlantic Causal Inference Competition and includes various representations to cover different data generating processes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IHDP Dataset**:
  > Hill, J. L. (2011). Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference. *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 20(1), 217-240.

- For the **NEWS Dataset**:
  > Johansson, F., Shalit, U., & Sontag, D. (2016). Learning representations for counterfactual inference. In *International Conference on Machine Learning* (pp. 3020-3029). PMLR.

- For the **ACIC2016 Dataset**:
  > Dorie, V., Hill, J., Shalit, U., Scott, M., & Cervone, D. (2019). Automated versus do-it-yourself methods for causal inference: Lessons learned from a data analysis competition. *Statistical Science*, 34(1), 43-68.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
