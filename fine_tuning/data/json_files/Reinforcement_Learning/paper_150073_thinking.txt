To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Low Rank Training of Deep Neural Networks" by Siddhartha Rao Kamalakara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of low-rank training but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions the need for efficient training paradigms and references various models, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4**, the authors describe their experiments on both vision and language models. They specifically mention using:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is used for training a Wide-ResNet-28 model. It is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community for image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for training a ResNet-50 model. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **LM1B (One Million Word Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks with the GPT-2 architecture. It is a standard benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009. URL: http://www.image-net.org/.

- For **LM1B**, the citation is:
  > Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., and Koehn, P. *One Billion Word Benchmark for Measuring Progress in Statistical Language Modeling*. CoRR, abs/1312.3005, 2013. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
