To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the test-time zero-shot generalization of vision-language models: Do we really need prompt learning?" by Maxime Zanella and Ismail Ben Ayed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their method on **15 datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive list of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, which includes various variants such as ImageNet-A, ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, and ImageNet-Sketch.
2. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition that contains 397 categories.
3. **Aircraft**: A dataset specifically for fine-grained classification of aircraft types.
4. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification based on satellite imagery.
5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing images of cars for fine-grained classification.
6. **Food101**: A dataset with 101 food categories for image classification.
7. **Oxford Pets**: A dataset containing images of pet breeds.
8. **Flower102**: A dataset for flower classification with 102 categories.
9. **Caltech101**: A dataset with 101 object categories.
10. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification.
11. **UCF101**: A dataset for human action recognition in videos.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their method on these datasets, providing further validation of their use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations for the datasets:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
