To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse-to-Fine Concept Bottleneck Models" by Konstantinos P. Panousis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **CUB Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-grained bird species identification and spans 200 classes. It is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed framework's performance.

2. **SUN Dataset**: This dataset comprises 717 classes and is noted for having a limited number of examples for each class. It is also mentioned as one of the datasets used for evaluation.

3. **ImageNet-1k Dataset**: A well-known dataset for object recognition that includes 1000 classes. The authors state that this dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **CUB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical report.

- For the **SUN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Hays, J., Ehinger, K. A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2010). SUN Database: Large-scale Scene Recognition from Abbey to Zoo. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3485–3492.

- For the **ImageNet-1k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
