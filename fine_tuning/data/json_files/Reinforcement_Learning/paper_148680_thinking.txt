To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments" by Zhi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used. For instance, if the authors refer to specific benchmarks or datasets for reinforcement learning tasks, I will note those down.

In this paper, the authors mention using **MuJoCo** for their experiments, which is a well-known physics engine used for simulating robotic tasks. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or configurations related to MuJoCo in the experiments section.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to the **MuJoCo** simulator, I will look for the citation that describes it in detail. The citation for MuJoCo is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026â€“5033.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will extract their names and corresponding citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details accurately.
