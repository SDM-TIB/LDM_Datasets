To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recursive Reinforcement Learning" by Ernst Moritz Hahn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

I will then examine the **experiments section**, which usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section is crucial as it often provides specific names, sizes, and characteristics of the datasets.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for others in the field.
