To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HPointLoc: Point-based Indoor Place Recognition using Synthetic RGB-D Images" by Dmitry Yudin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions a dataset called **HPointLoc**, which is specifically designed for visual place recognition in indoor environments. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of having a diverse and large-scale dataset for visual localization. They mention that the HPointLoc dataset is generated using the Habitat simulator and is intended for training and testing computer vision algorithms. This reinforces the significance of the HPointLoc dataset.

Moving on to the **datasets section** (which is likely to be found in the main body of the paper), I will look for detailed descriptions of the HPointLoc dataset. The authors provide a summary of the dataset, including its structure, the number of scenes, poses, categories, and instances. They also describe how the dataset was generated, including the types of images and additional information such as depth maps and instance segmentation.

In the **results section**, the authors may provide insights into how the HPointLoc dataset was utilized in their experiments, confirming its relevance and application in their research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the HPointLoc dataset or any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **Matterport3D dataset**, which is used as a basis for generating the HPointLoc dataset. I will ensure to include the full citation for Matterport3D as well.

The full citation for the HPointLoc dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I will summarize it based on the information available in the paper:

- **HPointLoc Dataset**: Yudin, D., Solomentsev, Y., Musaev, R., Staroverov, A., & Panov, A. I. (2023). HPointLoc: Point-based Indoor Place Recognition using Synthetic RGB-D Images. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

- **Matterport3D Dataset**: Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., Zhang, Y. (2017). Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as presented in the research paper.
