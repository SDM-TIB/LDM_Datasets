To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Networks and Identity Drive Geographic Properties of the Diffusion of Linguistic Innovation" by Aparna Ananthasubramaniam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "novel dataset of innovative words identified from a 10% sample of Twitter," indicating that there is a dataset related to linguistic innovations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the study. In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the process of identifying new words from UrbanDictionary.com and filtering them based on specific criteria. This suggests that there is a dataset of 76 innovative words that were analyzed.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets mentioned, particularly those related to the empirical analysis of the words' diffusion patterns. The authors discuss the spatial time series dataset of lexical innovations on Twitter, which is crucial for understanding the geographic diffusion of these words.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset of Innovative Words**: This dataset consists of 76 new words identified from Twitter, filtered from a larger set of slang entries from UrbanDictionary.com. The words represent various cultural phenomena and linguistic changes.

2. **Empirical Spatial Time Series Dataset**: This dataset contains the temporal and spatial distribution of the 76 new words over time, normalized to the number of users in each county.

   Citation:

3. **Twitter Dataset**: The study utilizes a 10% sample of tweets from Twitter to analyze the diffusion of the identified words. This dataset includes user interactions and mentions relevant to the linguistic innovations.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset, as they are essential for proper attribution and further research. Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare them for presentation or further analysis.
