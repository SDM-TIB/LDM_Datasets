To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Transfer Learning based Additive Manufacturing Models via A Case Study" by Yifan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study definition sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper is based on an open-source dataset about metal additive manufacturing products, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Case Study Definition)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their case study. They mention that the dataset contains process information and several target properties about laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) products fabricated with Ti-6Al-4V. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

The authors refer to the dataset as being defined in reference [47]. I will need to check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The reference [47] is:

- Liu, S., Stebner, A. P., Kappes, B. B., and Zhang, X. (2021). "Machine Learning for Knowledge Transfer across Multiple Metals Additive Manufacturing Printers." *Additive Manufacturing*, 39, pp. 101877.

Additionally, the paper mentions two source tasks and one target task, which are defined in **Table 1**. The specific datasets for these tasks are:

1. **Source Task 1 (EOS M270)**: Contains 49 data points with various process parameters.
2. **Source Task 2 (SLM 250 HL)**: Contains 32 data points with different process parameters.
3. **Target Task (SLM 125 HL)**: Contains 24 data points.

While the paper does not provide separate citations for these tasks, they are derived from the main dataset mentioned earlier.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the main dataset as it is the authoritative source for the data used in the case study.

In summary, I will create entries for the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Open-source dataset about metal AM products
  - **Description**: Contains process information and several target properties about LPBF products fabricated with Ti-6Al-4V.
  - **Citation**: Liu, S., Stebner, A. P., Kappes, B. B., and Zhang, X. (2021). "Machine Learning for Knowledge Transfer across Multiple Metals Additive Manufacturing Printers." *Additive Manufacturing*, 39, pp. 101877.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is structured appropriately for further processing or review.
