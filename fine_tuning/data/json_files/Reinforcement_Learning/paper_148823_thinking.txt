To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On (Emergent) Systematic Generalisation and Compositionality in Visual Referential Games with Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax Estimator" by Kevin DenamganaÃ¯ and James Alfred Walker, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are referenced.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection."

In this paper, the authors mention the **dSprites dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper. The dSprites dataset is noted for containing visual representations for combinations of values along generative factors, which is crucial for their study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **dSprites dataset**, the citation is:
> Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dSprites: Disentanglement Testing Sprites Dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and ready for any further processing or analysis.
