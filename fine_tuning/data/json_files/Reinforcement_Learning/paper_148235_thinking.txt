To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting the potential of deep reinforcement learning for classification tasks in high-dimensional and unstructured data" by Johan S. Obando-Ceron et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, technical contribution, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its application, but I need to delve deeper into the sections that discuss the methodology and experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying reinforcement learning (RL) to high-dimensional data, which sets the context for their work but does not mention specific datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **technical contribution section** where the authors describe their approach using a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) and reinforcement learning. They mention using the MNIST dataset as a baseline for their classification task, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In **Table 1**, the authors compare the classification accuracy of their proposed method (AE-DDQN) against the SVM classifier on several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of fashion product images, serving as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

The authors provide accuracy metrics for each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278â€“2323, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Zalando Research. "Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Ph.D. dissertation, University of Toronto, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
