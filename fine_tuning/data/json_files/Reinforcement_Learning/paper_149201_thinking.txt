To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improve Agents without Retraining: Parallel Tree Search with Off-Policy Correction" by Assaf Hallak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in reinforcement learning agents and mentions the use of Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using **pre-trained Rainbow agents** and refer to the **Atari environments**. I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks that are used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly name datasets in the traditional sense but refer to the **Atari environments** as the datasets for their experiments. The Atari environments are widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community, and they are often treated as benchmark datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the appropriate citations for the Atari environments. The relevant citations for the Atari environments are:

1. **Atari-CuLE**: 
   > Steven Dalton, Iuri Frosio, and Michael Garland. *Accelerating reinforcement learning through gpu atari emulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.08467, 2019.

2. **DQN Pre-trained Agents**:
   > Kaixhin. *Rainbow Pre-trained Agents v1.3*, 2019, MIT License.

Since the paper does not provide a detailed dataset citation for each specific Atari game, I will use the general references for the Atari environments and the pre-trained agents.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
