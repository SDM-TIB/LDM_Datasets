To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character Controllers Using Motion VAEs" by Hung Yu Ling et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors discuss their motion capture database, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their motion capture database, which contains 17 minutes of various human motions, including walking, running, turning, and resting. This section provides insight into the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of frames and types of motions included.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the paper does not explicitly cite external datasets but describes their own motion capture database. Therefore, I will summarize the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **Motion Capture Database**: This dataset consists of 17 minutes of motion capture data, including various actions like walking, running, turning, and resting. It contains approximately 30,000 frames captured at 30 Hz, and the data is used to train the autoregressive conditional variational autoencoder (MVAE).

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for their dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the context in which the dataset was used in the research. This will help in understanding the significance of the dataset in relation to the findings of the paper.
