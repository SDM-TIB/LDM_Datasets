To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Target Q-Learning with Reverse Experience Replay: Efficiently Finding the Optimal Policy for Linear MDPs" by Naman Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets," I will focus on that section for detailed descriptions.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets that are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. I will note down the names of these datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide proper attribution for each dataset. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I will look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> Brockman, G., et al. "OpenAI Gym." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540* (2016).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's purpose and relevance to the research presented in the paper, as this will be important for understanding the context in which they were used.
