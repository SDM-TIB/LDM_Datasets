To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shapley Q-value: A Local Reward Approach to Solve Global Reward Games" by Jianhong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of their proposed algorithm, SQDDPG, on several environments. They mention three specific environments: **Cooperative Navigation**, **Prey-and-Predator**, and **Traffic Junction**. This indicates that these environments may serve as datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) for detailed descriptions of these environments. In this section, the authors describe the settings and objectives for each environment:

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: This environment involves multiple agents navigating to targets without prior allocations. The dataset consists of the state information for each agent, including positions and velocities.

2. **Prey-and-Predator**: In this environment, three predators aim to capture a prey agent. The dataset includes the state information of the predators and the prey, such as their positions and velocities.

3. **Traffic Junction**: This environment simulates cars moving through traffic junctions. The dataset includes parameters like the number of cars, their routes, and the dynamics of the traffic system.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any original datasets or environments referenced in the paper. However, since these environments are likely created or defined by the authors for the purpose of their experiments, they may not have formal citations. Instead, I will note the environments as datasets used in the experiments.

The final step is to compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets (environments) and any relevant details about them, along with their descriptions. 

Here are the datasets I will include:

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: A dataset involving multiple agents navigating to targets.
2. **Prey-and-Predator**: A dataset where predators attempt to capture a prey agent.
3. **Traffic Junction**: A dataset simulating traffic dynamics at junctions.

Since these environments are not traditional datasets with formal citations, I will note them as experimental environments used in the study without specific citations.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
