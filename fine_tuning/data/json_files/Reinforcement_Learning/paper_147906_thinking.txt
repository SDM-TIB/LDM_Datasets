To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in First-Person Videos" by Yu Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **AnAn Accident Detection (A3D)**, which is a strong indicator that I should look for more details about it in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methods and datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **A3D dataset**, describing it as consisting of 1,500 video clips of traffic accidents collected from YouTube. They also provide details about the dataset, such as the number of frames, types of accidents, and how the data was labeled.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the same section, the authors reference the **Honda Egocentric View Intersection (HEV-I)** dataset, which is used for training their model. They describe it as consisting of 230 on-road videos at intersections, providing context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **AnAn Accident Detection (A3D)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Yu Yao, Mingze Xu, Yuchen Wang, David J. Crandall, Ella M. Atkins. *Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in First-Person Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2019.

2. For the **Honda Egocentric View Intersection (HEV-I)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Yao, Y., Xu, M., Choi, C., Crandall, D. J., & Atkins, E. M. *Egocentric vision-based future vehicle localization for intelligent driving assistance systems*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
