To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Function Approximation Perspective to Characterizing Post Hoc Explanations" by Tessa Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for empirical validation using various real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Life Expectancy Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and consists of demographic, economic, and health factors from 2000 to 2015, with 2,938 observations for 20 continuous features.

2. **Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Dataset**: This dataset is from FICO and contains information on HELOC applications, with 9,871 observations for 24 continuous features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Life Expectancy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > World Health Organization (WHO). Life expectancy dataset. Global Health Observatory Data Repository, 2018.

- For the **HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > FICO. Home equity line of credit (HELOC) dataset. Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper attribution, which is crucial for academic integrity and reproducibility.
