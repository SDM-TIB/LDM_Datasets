To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Probabilistic Simulator of Spatial Demand for Product Allocation" by Porter Jenkins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a "new, real-world dataset" used for training the proposed model, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the dataset in detail. In this paper, there is a **Dataset Description** section that provides a summary of the datasets used. Here, I find that the authors collected data from two large supermarket and retail stores in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, covering transactions from August 2018 to August 2019.

The key details I need to extract include:

1. **Store 1**:
   - **Regions**: 17
   - **Products**: 15
   - **Time Horizon**: August 2018 - August 2019

2. **Store 2**:
   - **Regions**: 12
   - **Products**: 15
   - **Time Horizon**: August 2018 - August 2019

The paper indicates that the dataset includes quantities sold for a set of 15 popular beverage products, along with daily counts of quantities at the region-product level.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are original data collected by the authors from the retail stores.

Since the datasets are original and do not have external citations, I will create a structured entry for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The entries will include the dataset name, description, and the authors' details as the source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
