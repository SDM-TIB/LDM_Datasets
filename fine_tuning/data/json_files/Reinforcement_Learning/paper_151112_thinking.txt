To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Local Path Following of an Autonomous Formula SAE Vehicle" by Harvey Merton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and mentions testing in both simulation and real-world environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to identify any specific datasets used for training or testing the models. In the **simulation setup**, the authors describe a simulation environment developed by the AMZ Driverless team, which is likely based on a dataset or a set of parameters rather than a traditional dataset. I will look for any references to specific datasets or data collection methods.

In the **real-world setup and results section**, the authors mention using ArUco markers to simulate cones for testing. This indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments, but I need to confirm if they refer to any established datasets or if they created their own.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that describe datasets relevant to their work. If they mention any datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned. If the authors created their own datasets, I will note that as well, but I will focus on any established datasets that are referenced.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing complete references for each dataset.
