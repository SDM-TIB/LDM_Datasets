To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Update and Unified Representation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jiancheng Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe two environments: **Spread** and **Predator-Prey**. I need to determine if these environments correspond to specific datasets or if they are experimental setups rather than formal datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Environments)**, the authors describe the **Spread** environment, which involves agents reaching different destinations without colliding. They mention two configurations: **Spread_3** and **Spread_10**. However, these appear to be experimental setups rather than standalone datasets.

In **section 4.1.2 (Mixed cooperative-competitive environments)**, the authors describe the **Predator-Prey** environment, which involves predators and preys. Similar to the Spread environment, they mention configurations like **Predator_3-Prey_1** and **Predator_6-Prey_2**, but again, these are experimental scenarios rather than formal datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any formal datasets with citations, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and methodologies in multi-agent reinforcement learning, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets with formal citations. Instead, they created their own experimental environments for the purpose of their research.

In conclusion, I will document the environments described in the paper, but I will note that they do not correspond to formal datasets with citations. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will summarize my findings regarding the environments used in the experiments:
1. **Spread Environment**: Configurations include Spread_3 and Spread_10.
2. **Predator-Prey Environment**: Configurations include Predator_3-Prey_1 and Predator_6-Prey_2.

Since these are not formal datasets, I will not include any citations. Instead, I will note that the authors created these environments for their experiments without referencing external datasets.
