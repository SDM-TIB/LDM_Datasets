To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable End-to-end Urban Autonomous Driving with Latent Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jianyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method was implemented and evaluated in the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that this simulator may be a key dataset or environment used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section VI (Experiments)** and **section V (Joint Learning of Environment Model and Driving Policy)**. In these sections, the authors describe their experimental setup and the data used for training and evaluation.

In **section VI (Experiments)**, the authors state that they trained and evaluated their method on the **CARLA simulator**. They describe the simulator as a high-definition open-source platform for autonomous driving research, which provides not only the driving environment but also raw sensor data inputs such as camera RGB images and lidar point clouds. This indicates that the CARLA simulator is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the CARLA simulator. The relevant citation is:

- For **CARLA simulator**:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss using **sensor inputs from camera and lidar**, but these are not datasets in themselves; rather, they are sources of data used within the CARLA simulator.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the primary dataset utilized for the experiments is the CARLA simulator. I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, confirming that the CARLA simulator is the main dataset referenced in the paper, and prepare to present this information in the required format.
