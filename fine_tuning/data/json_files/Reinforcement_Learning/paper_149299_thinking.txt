To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning cortical representations through perturbed and adversarial dreaming" by Nicolas Deperrois et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they train their model on "standard datasets of natural images," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, particularly **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 32 × 32 pixel images with three color channels. It is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset also consists of 32 × 32 pixel images and is used for digit recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2013). CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research).

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning.

Having gathered the dataset names and their full citations, I will now summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 32 × 32 pixel images used for image classification.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., & Hinton, G. (2013). CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research).

2. **SVHN**: A dataset of 32 × 32 pixel images used for digit recognition.
   - Citation: Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
