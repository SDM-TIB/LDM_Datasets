To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Feedback-based Exploration" by Jan Scholten et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method in experiments on continuous control problems of the OpenAI Gym, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **implementation and evaluation section** where the authors describe the environments used for benchmarking their method. They mention three specific environments from the OpenAI Gym: **Pendulum-v0**, **MountainCarContinuous-v0**, and **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The OpenAI Gym environments are widely recognized, and their citations can typically be traced back to the original OpenAI Gym paper. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. arXiv:1606.01540 [cs.LG].

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations:

1. **Pendulum-v0**: A classic control problem where the goal is to swing up and balance a pendulum.
2. **MountainCarContinuous-v0**: A continuous control problem where the objective is to drive a car up a hill.
3. **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**: A continuous control problem where the goal is to land a spacecraft between flags.

Since all three environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for each one. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.
