To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Based Communication in Distributed Q-Learning" by Daniel Jarne Ornia and Manuel Mazo Jr., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the methodologies and datasets used for their evaluations. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss a path planning problem and mention using a modified version of the **Frozen Lake environment** from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the Frozen Lake dataset is used for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including any modifications made for the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. In this case, since the Frozen Lake environment is a well-known benchmark, I will look for its original citation in the references.

The citation for the Frozen Lake environment is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions.
3. Note the **Frozen Lake environment** as the primary dataset used.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.
5. Compile the dataset information for structured output.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
