To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Path Following of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle" by Qilei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses testing methods in two path following tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section V) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention testing their methods in two tasks: **straight line following** and **sinusoids curve following**. However, I need to determine if these tasks are based on specific datasets or simulations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to using the **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Simulator** and mention that they modified it to fit their actual AUV system. This indicates that the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment rather than on real-world datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets used are not traditional datasets but rather simulated environments created for the purpose of their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the AUV simulator or any other relevant datasets. The authors cite the AUV simulator as:
- **AUV Simulator**: 
  > M. M. M. Manh√£es, S. A. Scherer, M. Voss, L. R. Douat, and T. Rauschenbach. *UUV simulator: A gazebo-based package for underwater intervention and multi-robot simulation*. In OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey, IEEE, sep 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets but rather focuses on a simulation environment, I will summarize this finding.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets (or in this case, the simulation environment) into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the AUV simulator as it is the primary resource referenced in the experiments.

In conclusion, I will create an entry for the AUV simulator, noting that it serves as the basis for the experiments conducted in the paper, and provide the full citation for it.
