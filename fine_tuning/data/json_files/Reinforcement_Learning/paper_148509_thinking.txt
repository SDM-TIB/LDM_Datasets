To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShieldNN: A Provably Safe NN Filter for Unsafe NN Controllers" by James Ferlez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including details about their size, structure, and purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset used for training and testing the reinforcement learning agents is likely derived from this simulator. However, I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets or configurations mentioned.

In the **experimental details**, the authors describe the setup for their experiments, including the use of the CARLA simulator. They mention collecting data from the simulator, but they do not specify a separate dataset name. Instead, they refer to the environment and the parameters used during the simulation.

Since the CARLA simulator is a well-known platform, I will look for the citation that corresponds to it. The relevant citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to ensure that I have the correct citation for the CARLA simulator and any other datasets mentioned.

After confirming the citation, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as it is the primary dataset used in the experiments.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the CARLA simulator from the references.
4. Document the dataset information clearly, including the citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
