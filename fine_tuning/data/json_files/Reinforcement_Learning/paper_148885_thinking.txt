To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Prioritized Experience Replay: A Value Perspective" by Ang A. Li, Zongqing Lu, and Chenglin Miao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of experience replay in reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the concept of prioritized experience replay but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to identify any datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments in grid-world maze and CartPole environments. However, these are not traditional datasets but rather simulated environments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding datasets. The appendix describes the experimental setups for the grid-world maze and CartPole but does not provide any external datasets or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather describes environments created for the experiments, I will note that there are no datasets to extract in the traditional sense. Instead, the experiments rely on simulated environments rather than publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for any references made in the paper, even if they do not pertain to datasets. 

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for dataset mentions.
2. Examine the experiments section for any datasets used.
3. Check the appendices for additional details.
4. Conclude that the paper does not utilize external datasets but rather simulated environments for its experiments.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations related to datasets. However, I will ensure to document the environments used in the experiments for completeness.
