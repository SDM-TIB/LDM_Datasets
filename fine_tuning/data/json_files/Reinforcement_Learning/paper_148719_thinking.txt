To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Hate Speech Detection through Evaluation of Social Group Counterfactuals" by Aida Mostafazadeh Davani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a corpus of social media posts from Gab, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Dataset section** of the paper, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the datasets used in the research. Here, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **SGT-Gab**: This dataset includes social media posts from Gab that mention one specific social group token (SGT). The authors state that they analyzed a subset of this dataset, which contains 2 million posts.

2. **Gab Hate Corpus (GHC)**: This dataset consists of 27,000 social media posts annotated for hate speech content. The authors also mention the **Stromfront dataset**, which contains 11,000 posts, also annotated for hate speech.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are:

- For the **Gab Hate Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Kennedy, B., Atari, M., Davani, A. M., Yeh, L., Omrani, A., Kim, Y., Coombs Jr., K., Havaldar, S., Portillo-Wightman, G., Gonzalez, E., Hoover, J., Azatian, A., Cardenas, G., Hussain, A., Lara, A., Omary, A., Park, C., Wang, X., Wijaya, C., Zhang, Y., Meyerowitz, B., and Dehghani, M. (2020). The Gab Hate Corpus: A collection of 27k posts annotated for hate speech. doi:10.31234/osf.io/hqjxn. URL: psyarxiv.com/hqjxn.

- For the **Stromfront dataset**, the citation is:
  > de Gibert, O., Perez, N., Garc√≠a-Pablos, A., and Cuadros, M. (2018). Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.04444.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
