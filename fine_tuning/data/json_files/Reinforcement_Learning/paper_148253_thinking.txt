To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dragonfly Algorithm and its Applications in Applied Science - Survey" by Chnoor M. Rahman and Tarik A. Rashid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the dragonfly algorithm and its applications, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **applications section** where the authors discuss various applications of the dragonfly algorithm. This section often contains references to datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the **results and evaluations section**, the authors may also refer to datasets used for benchmarking the algorithm's performance. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset from a specific study, I will note the details and ensure I have the complete citation for that dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights.
2. Examine the applications and results sections for mentions of datasets.
3. Note any specific datasets, their descriptions, and how they were used.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and organized format.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
