To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias-reduced Multi-step Hindsight Experience Replay for Efficient Multi-goal Reinforcement Learning" by Rui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in multi-goal reinforcement learning and mentions experimental results but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention conducting experiments in **eight challenging multi-goal robotics environments**. I will look for specific names of these environments, as they often serve as datasets in reinforcement learning research.

In Section 7.1 (Environments), the authors list the environments used in their experiments:

1. **SawyerReachXYZEnv-v1**: A robotics environment where the agent must reach a desired position.
2. **SawyerPushAndReachEnvEasy-v0**: A simpler version of the Sawyer environment focusing on pushing and reaching tasks.
3. **FetchReach-v1**: A robotic arm environment where the agent must reach a target position.
4. **FetchPush-v1**: An environment where the agent pushes an object to a target location.
5. **FetchSlide-v1**: The agent slides an object to a desired position.
6. **HandReach-v0**: A hand manipulation environment where the agent must reach a target with its fingers.
7. **HandManipulateBlockRotateXYZ-v0**: The agent manipulates a block to a specific orientation.
8. **FetchPickAndPlace-v1**: The agent picks up an object and places it at a target location.

These environments serve as datasets for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since these environments are likely derived from existing benchmarks or repositories, I will look for the original sources or papers that introduced these environments.

The citations for the environments are as follows:

- For **Sawyer environments**, the citation is:
  > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1094–1100, 2020.

- For **Fetch environments**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Plappert, Marcin Andrychowicz, Alex Ray, Bob McGrew, Bowen Baker, Glenn Powell, Jonas Schneider, Josh Tobin, Maciek Chociej, Peter Welinder, et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

- For **Hand environments**, the citation is:
  > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1094–1100, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

8. **FetchPickAndPlace-v1**
   - Citation: Matthias Plappert et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further tasks or analyses related to these datasets.
