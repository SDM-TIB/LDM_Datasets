To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topological Experience Replay" by Zhang-Wei Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the proposed method but does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges in reinforcement learning and mention the use of experience replay, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

I will then check the **experiments section (Section 5)**, which typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments they tested their method on. They mention two environments: **Minigrid** and **Sokoban**. 

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any specific references to datasets or environments in the **setup** subsection (5.1). The authors state that they evaluate their method in Minigrid and Sokoban, which are both environments used for reinforcement learning tasks. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations for these environments, as they are widely recognized benchmarks in the field.

Next, I will check the **related works** section to see if there are any references to datasets used in previous studies. However, this section primarily discusses prior methods and does not focus on specific datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the environments mentioned. The authors reference the Minigrid environment as follows:
- **Minigrid**: Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

For the **Sokoban** environment, the citation is:
- **Sokoban**: Schrader, M. (2018). Gym-Sokoban. Retrieved from https://github.com/mpSchrader/gym-sokoban.

Now that I have identified the relevant environments and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Minigrid Environment**:
   - Citation: Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

2. **Sokoban Environment**:
   - Citation: Schrader, M. (2018). Gym-Sokoban. Retrieved from https://github.com/mpSchrader/gym-sokoban.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
