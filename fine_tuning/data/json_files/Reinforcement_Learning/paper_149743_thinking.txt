To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness Predictions Natural Perturbations" by Sebastian Scher and Andreas Trügler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of robustness on specific datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Iris dataset** and the **Ionosphere dataset** for their experiments. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on how they relate to the robustness evaluations discussed in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **Iris Dataset**: This dataset is used for a binary classification task, and the authors mention that it consists of features normalized to unit variance. They describe the model used and the robustness evaluations conducted on this dataset.
2. **Ionosphere Dataset**: This dataset has 34 features, of which 2 are categorical and 32 are continuous. The authors specify that they removed the categorical features for their analysis and used a neural network for classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For the **Iris dataset**, the citation is:
  > Edgar Anderson. *The Species Problem in Iris*. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 23(3):457, September 1936. doi: 10.2307/2394164.

- For the **Ionosphere dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vincent G. Sigillito, Simon P. Wing, Larrie V. Hutton, and Kile B. Baker. *Classification of radar returns from the ionosphere using neural networks*. Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, 10(3):262–266, 1989.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
