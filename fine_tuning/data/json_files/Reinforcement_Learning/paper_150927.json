A portable commercial radio is used as the transmitter, and the receivers are 25 software-defined radio (SDR) nodes with omnidirectional antennas deployed on POWDER, an open wireless experimental testbed. The receivers can be categorized into 4 receiver types: Rooftop, Fixed, Mobile, and Dense, according to the radio-antenna-placement differentiation.",
