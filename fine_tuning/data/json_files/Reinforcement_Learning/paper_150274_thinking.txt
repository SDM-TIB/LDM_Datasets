To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraffMatch: Global Matching of 3D Lines and Planes for Wide Baseline LiDAR Registration" by Parker C. Lusk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on "publicly-available LiDAR datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their evaluation methodology. In this section, they mention using three datasets for their evaluations:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors specify that they used sequences 00, 02, 05, and 08 from the KITTI dataset. This dataset is widely recognized in the field of autonomous driving and computer vision.

2. **KITTI-360 Dataset**: They also mention using sequences 00, 04, 06, and 09 from the KITTI-360 dataset, which is an extension of the original KITTI dataset designed for more comprehensive urban scene understanding.

3. **NCLT Dataset**: The authors refer to sessions from the NCLT dataset, specifically sessions from 2012-04-29, 2012-05-11, and 2012-12-01. This dataset is used for long-term localization and mapping.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For the **KITTI-360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Liao, J. Xie, and A. Geiger. *KITTI-360: A novel dataset and benchmarks for urban scene understanding in 2D and 3D*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2022.

- For the **NCLT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Carlevaris-Bianco, A. K. Ushani, and R. M. Eustice. *University of Michigan North Campus long-term vision and LiDAR dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 35, no. 9, pp. 1023â€“1035, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
