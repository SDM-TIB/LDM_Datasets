To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic uncertainty guides the extension of conventions to new referents" by Ron Eliav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **KILOGRAM dataset**, which is a collection of abstract tangram images. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the KILOGRAM dataset is referenced multiple times, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe how they utilized the KILOGRAM dataset for their experiments, specifically mentioning that it contains well-normed tangram stimuli and is designed to assess nameability. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KILOGRAM dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Ji, A., Kojima, N., Rush, N., Suhr, A., Vong, W. K., Hawkins, R., & Artzi, Y. (2022). *Abstract visual reasoning with tangram shapes*. Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 582â€“601.

Since the KILOGRAM dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the KILOGRAM dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
