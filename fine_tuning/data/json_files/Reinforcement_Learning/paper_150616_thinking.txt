To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining a machine learning decision to physicians via counterfactuals" by Supriya Nagesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper uses the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In section 4.1, they mention that they use the **MIMIC-III dataset** for their experiments, which confirms its role in the study.

I will also check the **data and code availability** section, which provides additional context about the dataset. The authors mention that the MIMIC-III dataset is available on the Physionet repository, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, H Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MIMIC-III dataset, I will ensure that I document this dataset thoroughly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the citation, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset used in the research.
