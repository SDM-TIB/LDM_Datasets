To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning" by Tim Salimans et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on **MuJoCo** and **Atari**, indicating that these environments may involve specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **section 4.1 (MuJoCo)**, the authors describe their evaluation on a benchmark of continuous robotic control problems in the OpenAI Gym. This suggests that the **OpenAI Gym** environments are the datasets being utilized for the MuJoCo experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Atari)**, the authors mention running their implementation on **51 Atari 2600 games available in OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that the Atari games themselves serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. For the **MuJoCo** physics engine, the citation is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

3. For the **Atari 2600 games**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for each game, it references the work of Mnih et al. (2016) for the DQN and A3C methods, which can be cited as:
   > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellemare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, et al. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529–533, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly defined with its citation to ensure proper attribution.
