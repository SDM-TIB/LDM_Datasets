To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assisting Unknown Teammates in Unknown Tasks: Ad Hoc Teamwork under Partial Observability" by Cassandro Martinho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention three specific environments: the Night-time Pursuit domain, the Pursuit domain under partial observability, and the Overcooked domain.

1. **Night-time Pursuit Domain**: This is a modified version of the Pursuit domain where agents must capture static preys. The paper describes it as a scenario with fixed prey positions and outlines the characteristics of the environment.

2. **Pursuit Domain under Partial Observability**: This domain involves agents capturing a moving prey while dealing with partial observability. The paper details how the ad hoc agent interacts with the environment and the types of observations it can make.

3. **Overcooked Domain**: This domain is a well-known benchmark for cooperation tasks where two agents (a helper and a cook) must work together to prepare soups. The paper references this domain as a standard for evaluating cooperation in multi-agent systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of any datasets or related works that are mentioned. For example, the Overcooked domain is referenced as a benchmark in the paper, and I will need to find its original citation.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Night-time Pursuit domain**, I will check if there is a specific citation or reference to the original Pursuit domain paper.
- For the **Overcooked domain**, I will find the original paper that introduced this benchmark.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective references for further exploration.
