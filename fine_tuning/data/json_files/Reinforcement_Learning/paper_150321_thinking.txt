To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedHQL: Federated Heterogeneous Q-Learning" by Flint Xiaofeng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of federated reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or examples that could hint at specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical evaluations in **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where they mention using standard RL tasks. I will check if they specify any datasets used for these tasks.

In **section 5.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments using the classical control tasks of **CartPole** and **LunarLander** from the **OpenAI Gym** environment. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CartPole**:
   - Citation: 
     > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **LunarLander**:
   - Citation: 
     > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Both tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information extracted from the paper. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the datasets utilized in the research.
