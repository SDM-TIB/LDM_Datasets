To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for History-Aware Hyperparameter Optimisation in Reinforcement Learning" by Juan Marcelo Parra-Ullauri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for hyperparameter optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention a case study involving **Airborne Base Stations (ABS)** using DQN (Deep Q-Network) for decision-making in a 5G mobile communications context. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name; instead, they describe the scenario and the parameters involved in their experiments.

I will also check the **background section (Section 2)** for any references to datasets used in previous studies or related work. The authors reference various hyperparameter optimization techniques and RL algorithms but do not specify datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will note that the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment involving ABS and DQN, which may imply the use of synthetic data generated during the experiments.

Finally, I will compile my findings. Since there are no datasets with full citations to provide, I will summarize the context of the experiments and the absence of specific datasets in the paper.

In summary, the paper does not provide any datasets with full citations, but it discusses a case study involving DQN and ABS in a 5G context, which may involve synthetic data generated during the experiments.
