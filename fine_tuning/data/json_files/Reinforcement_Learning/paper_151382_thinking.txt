To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEL’M: Test and Evaluation of Language Models" by George Cybenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any references to datasets used for testing or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the TEL’M framework. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced as part of the testing and evaluation process. If the authors mention any benchmarks or datasets used for comparison, I will note them down.

In the **background section**, the authors discuss various language models and benchmarks. I will pay attention to any datasets that are cited as part of the evaluation of these models. This section may contain references to well-known datasets in the field of language model evaluation.

I will also check the **appendix**, as it may contain additional examples or case studies that reference specific datasets used in their experiments. The appendix often provides practical examples that can clarify the methodology.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **GLUE Benchmark**, I will look for the original paper that introduced this benchmark to provide a complete citation. Similarly, if they reference any specific datasets like **SQuAD** or **MMLU**, I will find their respective citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the documentation is clear and organized, making it easy for others to understand the datasets utilized in the study and their significance in the context of language model evaluation.
