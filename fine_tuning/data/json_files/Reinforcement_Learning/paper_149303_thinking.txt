To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Border-SegGCN: Improving Semantic Segmentation by Refining the Border Outline using Graph Convolutional Network" by Naina Dhingra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on the **CamVid** and **Carla** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about these datasets. The authors mention that they use these datasets for semantic segmentation tasks, which reinforces their importance in the study.

In the **methodology** section, particularly in **section 3.1**, the authors describe how they utilize the **CamVid** and **Carla** datasets for evaluation. They provide details about the frame sizes and the number of classes in these datasets, which is useful for understanding their structure and application.

I will also check the **experiments** section, where the authors provide quantitative results and further confirm the use of the **CamVid** and **Carla** datasets. They mention specific metrics achieved on these datasets, which highlights their significance in the research.

Finally, I will refer to the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
   > Brostow, G. J., Fauqueur, J., & Cipolla, R. (2008). Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database. *Pattern Recognition Letters*, xx(x):xxâ€“xx.

2. For the **Carla dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). Carla: An open urban driving simulator. In *Conference on robot learning*. PMLR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
