To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motif-Consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement for Graph-Level Anomaly Detection" by Shikang Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is common in research papers. In this case, I find that the authors present statistics for four datasets: **IMDB-BINARY**, **IMDB-MULTI**, **REDDIT-BINARY**, and **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**.

I will note the following details for each dataset:
1. **IMDB-BINARY**: Contains 1,000 graphs, 2 classes, with an average of 19.77 nodes and 96.53 edges, and 9.0% anomalies.
2. **IMDB-MULTI**: Contains 1,500 graphs, 3 classes, with an average of 13.00 nodes and 65.94 edges, and 4.7% anomalies.
3. **REDDIT-BINARY**: Contains 2,000 graphs, 2 classes, with an average of 429.63 nodes and 497.75 edges, and 9.0% anomalies.
4. **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**: Contains 5,000 graphs, 5 classes, with an average of 508.52 nodes and 594.87 edges, and 4.7% anomalies.

After identifying the datasets and their characteristics, I will check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper may not provide specific citations for each dataset, but I will look for any references that discuss the datasets or their original sources.

In this case, the paper does not explicitly provide citations for the datasets used. However, I can infer that the datasets are commonly used in the field of graph anomaly detection and may have been introduced in previous works. I will note that the authors reference existing literature in the related work section, which may contain relevant citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, characteristics, and any available citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper citations where applicable.
