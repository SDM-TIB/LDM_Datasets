To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing the Potential of Classical Q-learning in General Game Playing" by Hui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of Q-learning in General Game Playing (GGP) for three small-board games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Hex. This indicates that these games may serve as datasets for the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention the three games used for their experiments:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Connect Four**: A two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid.
3. **Hex**: A two-player abstract strategy game played on a hexagonal grid.

The authors provide details about the experimental setup for each game, including the number of matches played and the parameters used for Q-learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or foundational works related to these games. However, since these games are well-known and do not have specific dataset citations, I will note that they are standard games used in GGP research.

The relevant citations for the foundational works mentioned in the paper are:

- For the General Game Playing framework, the citation is:
  > Genesereth, M., Love, N., & Pell, B. (2005). General game playing: Overview of the AAAI competition. *AI Magazine*, 26(2), 62â€“72.

- For the Game Description Language (GDL), the citation is:
  > Love, N., Hinrichs, T., Haley, D., Schkufza, E., & Genesereth, M. (2008). General game playing: Game description language specification. Stanford Tech Report LG-2006-1.

Since the games themselves (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Hex) are widely recognized and do not have specific dataset citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A well-known game used as a dataset for testing Q-learning algorithms.
2. **Connect Four**: Another classic game utilized in the experiments.
3. **Hex**: A strategic game included in the evaluation of Q-learning performance.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be noted with its context in the experiments, and I will ensure to include the relevant citations for the foundational works that support the research.
