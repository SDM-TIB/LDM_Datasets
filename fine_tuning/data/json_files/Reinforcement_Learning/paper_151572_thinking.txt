To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARDuP: Active Region Video Diffusion for Universal Policies" by Shuaiyi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on the **simulator CLIPort** and the **real-world dataset BridgeData v2**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors specifically state that they evaluate their method on **CLIPort** and **BridgeData v2**. I will note down the key characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

1. **CLIPort**: This is described as an extended benchmark for language-grounded tasks for manipulation in the simulator Ravens. The authors mention that they train their models on 110k demonstrations spanning 11 distinct tasks and evaluate on 3 unseen tasks.

2. **BridgeData v2**: This dataset is characterized as a large and diverse real-world dataset for robotic manipulation, containing 60,096 trajectories with natural language instructions, gathered from 24 different environments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **CLIPort**, the citation is:
  > M. Shridhar, L. Manuelli, and D. Fox. *Cliport: What and where pathways for robotic manipulation*. In Conference on Robot Learning. PMLR, 2022, pp. 894–906.

- For **BridgeData v2**, the citation is:
  > H. R. Walke, K. Black, T. Z. Zhao, Q. Vuong, C. Zheng, P. Hansen-Estruch, A. W. He, V. Myers, M. J. Kim, M. Du, et al. *Bridgedata v2: A dataset for robot learning at scale*. In Conference on Robot Learning. PMLR, 2023, pp. 1723–1736.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
