To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compositional Neural Programs with Recursive Tree Search and Planning" by Thomas Pierrot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm, AlphaNPI, but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of learning skills in AI but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experiments with the AlphaNPI agent, particularly in the context of sorting tasks and the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. However, they do not mention any external datasets; instead, they describe the environments and tasks they created for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will look for any references to prior works or datasets in the **References section**. The authors cite various papers related to neural programming and reinforcement learning, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned that are publicly available.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that there are no datasets extracted from external sources. The experiments are conducted in custom environments designed by the authors, specifically for the Tower of Hanoi and sorting tasks, which do not correspond to any standard datasets.

Thus, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the experiments were conducted in proprietary environments rather than using established datasets.

In summary, I will note the following:
- No external datasets were mentioned in the paper.
- The experiments were conducted in custom environments (Tower of Hanoi and sorting tasks) created by the authors.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This concludes the extraction process for this paper.
