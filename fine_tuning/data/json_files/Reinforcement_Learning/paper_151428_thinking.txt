To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoS: Enhancing Personalization and Mitigating Bias with Context Steering" by Jerry Zhi-Yang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed method on various applications, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention several datasets used for different applications:

1. **Implicit Hate Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of quantifying implicit hate in online texts. The authors state that it consists of hate tweets labeled with target groups and implied statements. 

2. **Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance in ambiguous situations and to assess bias across various demographics.

3. **PENS Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of personalized news headline generation, which is relevant to the personalization aspect of the study.

4. **Movie Dialogue Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset of annotated movie dialogues used for exploring personalization in conversational contexts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
