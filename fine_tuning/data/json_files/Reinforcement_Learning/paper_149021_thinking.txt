To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning and Planning in Complex Action Spaces" by Thomas Hubert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention two specific benchmark domains: **DeepMind Control Suite** and **Real-World RL Suite**. I will take note of these as they are likely to be the datasets used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation is:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., and Riedmiller, M. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

2. **Real-World RL Suite**: The citation is:
   > Dulac-Arnold, G., Levine, N., Mankowitz, D. J., Li, J., Paduraru, C., Gowal, S., and Hester, T. *An empirical investigation of the challenges of real-world reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.12983, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
