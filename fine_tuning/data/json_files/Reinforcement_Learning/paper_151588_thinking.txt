To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Long-Horizon Tasks with Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Kwanyoung Park and Youngwoon Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous methods on long-horizon tasks, specifically mentioning the **D4RL AntMaze tasks** and the **NeoRL benchmark**. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks are likely included.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction discusses the challenges of offline reinforcement learning and mentions the use of model-generated data. It also references the **D4RL AntMaze tasks** and **MuJoCo Gym tasks**, suggesting that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. Here, the authors explicitly mention using the **D4RL AntMaze tasks** and **D4RL MuJoCo Gym tasks** for their experiments. They specify that they used various datasets from D4RL, including **umaze**, **medium**, **large**, and **ultra** datasets for the AntMaze tasks, and several datasets for the MuJoCo tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **D4RL AntMaze tasks**:
   > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219*.

2. For the **D4RL MuJoCo Gym tasks**:
   > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219*.

Both datasets are part of the same D4RL project, which provides various benchmarks for reinforcement learning.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
