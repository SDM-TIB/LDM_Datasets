To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning for Zero-Shot Generalization in RL" by Bogdan Mazoure et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Procgen benchmark suite** for evaluating the proposed method, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on the **Procgen benchmark suite**. I will gather specific details about this dataset, such as its characteristics and the context in which it was used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Procgen benchmark suite. The citation for the Procgen benchmark suite is:
> Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2020). Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning. In *Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Procgen Benchmark Suite**: This dataset consists of procedurally generated levels for 16 video games, designed to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms in zero-shot generalization settings.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
