To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Framework for Cross-Domain and Cross-System Recommendations" by Feng Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on **four real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where they describe the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **DoubanBook**: A dataset containing user interactions related to books.
2. **DoubanMusic**: A dataset containing user interactions related to music.
3. **DoubanMovie**: A dataset containing user interactions related to movies.
4. **MovieLens 20M**: A well-known dataset for movie recommendations.

I will also note the details provided for each dataset, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and density, as these details may be useful for further analysis or reporting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Douban datasets** (DoubanBook, DoubanMusic, DoubanMovie), the citation is:
  > Douban. *Douban datasets*. Available at: https://www.douban.com/doubanapp/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

- For **MovieLens 20M**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2016). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 19.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
