To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Point Cloud Analysis via Learning Orientations for Message Passing" by Shitong Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which the research is applied, which can lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Section 5**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **ModelNet40** dataset for point cloud classification tasks and the **ShapeNet** dataset for part segmentation tasks. These are key datasets that I need to document.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **ModelNet40**:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *ModelNet: A Large 3D Model Repository*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912â€“1920.

2. **ShapeNet**:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., ... & Savarese, S. (2015). *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation.
