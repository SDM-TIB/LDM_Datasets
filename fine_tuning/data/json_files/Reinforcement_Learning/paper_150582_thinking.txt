To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VA-learning as a more efficient alternative to Q-learning" by Yunhao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments" or "Methodology."** In these sections, authors usually describe the datasets used for training and evaluation, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

While reading through the paper, I will pay attention to any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to a specific benchmark or dataset used in their experiments, I will note that down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **Atari-57 games** as a dataset for their experiments, I will look for the original source or citation for this dataset in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific sections that discuss datasets, such as "Experiments" or "Methodology."
3. Note down the names and descriptions of datasets mentioned.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
