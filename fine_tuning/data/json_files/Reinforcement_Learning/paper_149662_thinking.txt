To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness for Text Classification Tasks with Identity Information Data Augmentation Methods" by Mohit Wadhwa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically show their methods on "two well-known text classification tasks," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Toxic Comment Classification Dataset**: This dataset is used for a binary classification task involving toxic comments. The authors refer to it as a well-known dataset in the context of text classification.

2. **Hate Speech Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a public dataset used for classification tasks related to hate speech.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the source of the datasets.

- For the **Toxic Comment Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ona de Gibert, Naiara Perez, Aitor García-Pablos, and Montse Cuadros. *Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum*. Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), 2018.

- For the **Hate Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lucas Dixon, John Li, Jeffrey Sorensen, Nithum Thain, and Lucy Vasserman. *Measuring and mitigating unintended bias in text classification*. In Proceedings of the 2018 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, 67–73.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's details, including their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the information is ready for further processing or review.
