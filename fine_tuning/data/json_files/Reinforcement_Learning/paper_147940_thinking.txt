To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Neural Networks via Feature Visualization: A survey" by Anh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, which may hint at the datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss various methods and applications of activation maximization, which may involve specific datasets used for training or testing their models.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they may reference datasets or provide visual examples that indicate the datasets used. For instance, if the authors present results based on specific datasets, those datasets should be noted.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Deng, J., et al. "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In CVPR (2009).

If the paper discusses other datasets, such as the **MIT Places dataset** or **UCF-101 dataset**, I will similarly locate their citations in the references.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
