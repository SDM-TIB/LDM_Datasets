To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curious Replay for Model-based Adaptation" by Isaac Kauvar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **Crafter benchmark** and the **Deepmind Control Suite**, indicating that these are datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, particularly in sections 2 and 4. They mention using the **Crafter** environment and the **Deepmind Control Suite** for their evaluations.

In section 2.4, the authors describe **Crafter** as a procedurally generated, open-world survival game where agents pursue various hierarchical achievements. This section provides insight into how the dataset is structured and its significance in testing adaptability.

In section 4.1, they discuss the **Deepmind Control Suite**, which is modified to create changing environments for their experiments. This suite is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and the authors detail how they adapted it for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Crafter benchmark**, the citation is:
   > Hafner, D. (2021). *Benchmarking the spectrum of agent capabilities*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.06780.

2. For the **Deepmind Control Suite**, the citation is:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., & Tassa, Y. (2018). *Deepmind control suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
