To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally Nonstationary Component Analysis; Application to Noninvasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Extraction" by Fahimeh Jamshidian-Tehrani, Reza Sameni, and Christian Jutten, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on **publicly available datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors reference the challenges of fetal ECG extraction and mention the use of a publicly available fECG database, which is a good indication that a dataset is involved.

In the **case study section (Section IV)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Open-Source Electrophysiological Toolbox (OSET)** dataset for their experiments. They describe the dataset as consisting of recordings from eight maternal abdominal channels with a sampling rate of 500 Hz, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **OSET dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Sameni, The Open-Source Electrophysiological Toolbox (OSET), [Online]. Available: https://gitlab.com/rsameni/OSET/version 3.14, 2018.

Additionally, they mention using the **PhysioNet abdominal and direct fetal electrocardiogram database** for performance assessment, which is another dataset I need to include. The citation for this dataset is:
- For the **PhysioNet database**, the citation is:
  > PhysioNet, Abdominal and Direct Fetal Electrocardiogram Database, National Institutes of Health. [Online]. Available: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/adfecgdb/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
