To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Weighted Q-Learning" by Andrea Cini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical evaluation of the proposed method on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their evaluations. Here, they mention testing their method on three environments: **Lunar Lander**, **Asterix**, and **MinAtar**. I will look for specific details about these environments to determine if they are publicly available datasets or benchmarks.

In **Section 5.1 (Lunar Lander)**, the authors state that they used the Lunar Lander environment from the OpenAI Gym. This is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning.

In **Section 5.2 (Asterix)**, the authors mention using the Asterix game from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). This is another established benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

In **Section 5.3 (MinAtar)**, the authors refer to the MinAtar testbed, which is designed to mimic the dynamics of games from ALE but with a simplified state representation. This testbed is also publicly available.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Lunar Lander**, the citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. 

2. For **Asterix**, the citation is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253â€“279.

3. For **MinAtar**, the citation is:
   > Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). MinAtar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Lunar Lander**: A reinforcement learning environment from OpenAI Gym, where agents control a spacecraft to land safely.
- **Asterix**: A game from the Arcade Learning Environment used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **MinAtar**: A testbed that simulates the dynamics of Atari games with a simplified state representation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
