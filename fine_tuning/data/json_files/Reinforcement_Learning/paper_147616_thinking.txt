To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMBER: Adaptive Multi-Batch Experience Replay for Continuous Action Control" by Seungyul Han and Youngchul Sung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation on various continuous control tasks, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine **section 7 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. They mention conducting numerical experiments on OpenAI GYM environments, specifically continuous action control tasks. This indicates that the datasets or environments used for the experiments are likely part of the OpenAI GYM framework.

In **Table 1**, the authors list several continuous action control tasks along with their state and action dimensions. The tasks mentioned include:

1. **HalfCheetah-v1**
2. **Hopper-v1**
3. **HumanoidStandup-v1**
4. **Humanoid-v1**
5. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v1**
6. **InvertedPendulum-v1**
7. **Swimmer-v1**
8. **Reacher-v1**
9. **Walker2d-v1**
10. **Pendulum-v0**
11. **BipedalWalker-v2**
12. **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2**

These tasks are part of the OpenAI GYM, which serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted in this paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI GYM, which is the primary source of the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for OpenAI GYM is:

> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets beyond the OpenAI GYM environments, I will compile the information I have gathered.

I will create entries for the datasets based on the environments listed in Table 1, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI GYM as the source of these datasets.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, summarizing the datasets utilized in the research paper.
