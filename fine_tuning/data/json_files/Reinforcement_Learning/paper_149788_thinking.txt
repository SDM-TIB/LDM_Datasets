To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enforcing KL Regularization in General Tsallis Entropy Reinforcement Learning via Advantage Learning" by Lingwei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a dedicated **Datasets section** or subsections within the experiments. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning tasks, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

If they reference a specific dataset like **MinAtar**, I would find its citation as well:
> Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
