To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Navigation and Radio Mapping for Cellular-Connected UAV with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Yong Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a new coverage-aware navigation approach and mentions simulation results, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their simulations. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe the simulation environment, including the urban area size and the number of cellular base stations (BSs). However, they do not explicitly mention a specific dataset name. Instead, they refer to the simulation parameters and the methodology used to generate the data for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. For example, they mention using a statistical model for building locations and heights based on ITU recommendations, which could imply the use of datasets derived from those models.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with formal citations, I will summarize the relevant information as follows:

1. **Simulation Environment**: The authors created a simulated urban area of size 2 km Ã— 2 km with high-rise buildings, which was generated based on statistical models. This environment is crucial for their experiments but does not correspond to a publicly available dataset.

2. **Building Model**: The building locations and heights were generated based on a statistical model suggested by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [40]. This reference can be cited as a source of the data generation method.

3. **Cellular Network Parameters**: The paper discusses the parameters for the cellular network, including the number of BSs and their configurations, but again, these are not linked to a specific dataset.

Since there are no explicit datasets provided in the paper, I will compile the information as follows:

- For the urban simulation environment:
  > No specific dataset was used; the environment was simulated based on statistical models.

- For the building model:
  > International Telecommunication Union (ITU). "Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of terrestrial broadband radio access systems operating in a frequency range from 3 to 60 GHz." ITU-R Rec. P.1410-5, Feb. 2012.

Now, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant information and citations accurately, even if they do not correspond to traditional datasets. This will help in understanding the context of the experiments conducted in the paper.
