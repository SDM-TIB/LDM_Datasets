To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A general class of surrogate functions for stable and efficient reinforcement learning" by Sharan Vaswani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. For example, if the authors describe the environments or tasks they tested their methods on, I will extract the names of those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

I will ensure that I accurately capture the details and citations for each dataset, as this is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive dataset summary from the research paper.
