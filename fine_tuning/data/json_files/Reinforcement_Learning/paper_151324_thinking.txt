To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Ingredients for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Edoardo Cetin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce a novel testbed (MOOD) for offline reinforcement learning, which suggests that there may be specific datasets associated with this testbed.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of offline reinforcement learning and mentions the MOOD testbed, indicating that it likely contains datasets derived from various tasks.

I will then look into **section 3 (MOOD evaluation)**, where the authors describe the MOOD testbed in detail. Here, they mention that MOOD is based on the DeepMind Control suite and includes datasets with mixed data from different behaviors. They specify that the datasets are created by merging data from different tasks and relabeling them for benchmarking purposes. This section is crucial as it likely contains the names and descriptions of the datasets.

The authors categorize the datasets into three types:
1. **Same-objective datasets**: Involve a single source task equal to the target task.
2. **Cross-objective datasets**: Involve a single source task different from the target task.
3. **Mixed-objective datasets**: Include data from multiple tasks.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or references to datasets that may not have been included in the main sections of the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will involve checking the **References section** to find the original sources for the datasets, especially for the MOOD testbed, which is based on the DeepMind Control suite.

For example, if the authors refer to the DeepMind Control suite, I will cite it as follows:
- Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
