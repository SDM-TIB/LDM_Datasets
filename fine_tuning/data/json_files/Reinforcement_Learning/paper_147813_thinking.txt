To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Negotiating Behavior Between Cars in Intersections using Deep Q-Learning" by Tommy Tram et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section VI (Implementation)**, which discusses the simulation environment. This section is likely to contain details about the datasets or simulated data used for training the Deep Q-Learning model. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

In this paper, the authors describe a simulation environment where the ego vehicle interacts with other vehicles with different driving behaviors (aggressive, passive, cautious). However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets; instead, they create their own simulated data based on predefined driver behaviors. This means I need to note that the dataset is not a traditional dataset but rather a simulated dataset generated for the purpose of this study.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used for comparison or background information. However, in this case, the references primarily discuss related works and do not point to specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather describes a simulation setup, I will summarize the simulated dataset as follows:

1. **Simulated Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of simulated interactions between an ego vehicle and up to four other vehicles, each exhibiting different driving behaviors (aggressive, passive, cautious). The dataset is generated through a simulation environment designed for the study, and it includes various scenarios of vehicle interactions at intersections.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source of the simulated dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Tommy Tram, Anton Jansson, Robin Grönberg, Mohammad Ali, Jonas Sjöberg. *Learning Negotiating Behavior Between Cars in Intersections using Deep Q-Learning*. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the simulated dataset, ensuring it is clear that this is a generated dataset rather than a publicly available one. This will help in understanding the context of the research and the data used for training the models.
