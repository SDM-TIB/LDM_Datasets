To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can language agents be alternatives to PPO? A Preliminary Empirical Study On OpenAI Gym" by Junjie Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using environments collected in OpenAI Gym, which suggests that these environments may serve as datasets for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets or environments that are utilized in their experiments. The authors mention using environments from OpenAI Gym, which is a significant clue.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This could provide additional context or specific datasets that are commonly used in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

From my reading, I will note the following datasets:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environments**: The paper mentions several environments from OpenAI Gym, including:
   - **CartPole-v0**
   - **MountainCar-v0**
   - **CliffWalking-v0**
   - **Blackjack-v1**
   - **LunarLander-v2**
   - **Taxi-v3**
   - **MountainCarContinuous-v0**
   - **Acrobot-v1**

For each of these environments, I will provide the full citation for the OpenAI Gym paper, which is foundational for these datasets:

- For OpenAI Gym, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented and attributed in accordance with academic standards.
