To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MA-Dreamer: Coordination and communication through shared imagination" by Kenzo Lobos-Tsunekawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on soccer-based games, which suggests that datasets related to these games might be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a modified version of tasks proposed in Liu et al. [2019] for evaluating their method. This indicates that the datasets used for these tasks are likely derived from the original work by Liu et al.

In the **A Soccer Environment** section, the authors detail the modifications made to the Deep Mind Soccer Environment, which is based on the work of Liu et al. [2019]. This suggests that the original soccer environment dataset is being utilized.

Now, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations for any datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **Deep Mind Soccer Environment**, the citation is:
   > Siqi Liu, Guy Lever, Nicholas Heess, Josh Merel, Saran Tunyasuvunakool, and Thore Graepel. *Emergent coordination through competition*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkG8sjR5Km.

2. For the **referential tasks** mentioned in the experiments, the citation is:
   > Igor Mordatch and Pieter Abbeel. *Emergence of grounded compositional language in multi-agent populations*. 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2018, pages 1495â€“1502, 2018.

3. For the **navigation task** referenced, the citation is:
   > Hengyuan Hu, Adam Lerer, Alex Peysakhovich, and Jakob N. Foerster. *"other-play" for zero-shot coordination*. CoRR, abs/2003.02979, 2020. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02979.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset's source.
