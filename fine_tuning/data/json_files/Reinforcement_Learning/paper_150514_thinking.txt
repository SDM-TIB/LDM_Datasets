To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The FAIRy Tale of Genetic Algorithms" by Fahad Maqbool et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in solving optimization problems but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for any specific datasets used in the research. In this paper, the authors focus on the application of FAIR principles to algorithms rather than on specific datasets. However, they do mention that they have performed a limited survey of existing GA algorithms and their implementations, which may imply the use of datasets in those studies.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references primarily focus on the theoretical aspects and applications of GAs, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors reference various implementations of GAs available on GitHub and other repositories, which may contain datasets used in those implementations.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, and I will provide a citation for the paper itself:

- Maqbool, F., Razzaq, M. S., & Jabeen, H. (2023). The FAIRy Tale of Genetic Algorithms. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*. 

This citation will serve as a reference for the context in which the discussion of datasets was made, even if no explicit datasets were extracted.
