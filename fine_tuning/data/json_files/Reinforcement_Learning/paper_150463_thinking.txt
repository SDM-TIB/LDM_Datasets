To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Specification-Guided Data Aggregation for Semantically Aware Imitation Learning" by Ameesh Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets or simulators used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are used for evaluation.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach in detail, including any datasets used for training or testing their models. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, especially in the context of the CARLA driving simulator, as this is a key component of their experiments.

The **experimental setup section** is crucial as it typically outlines the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for specific details about the datasets, such as the number of samples, the types of scenarios included, and any relevant properties or specifications that define the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: The paper mentions using the CARLA driving simulator for their experiments. I will look for the citation that describes this simulator, which is a widely used tool in autonomous driving research.

2. **Expert Datasets**: The authors mention collecting expert data from human drivers in the CARLA simulator. I will need to find the citation that describes how this data was collected and any relevant details about the dataset.

3. **Signal Temporal Logic (STL) Properties**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, the authors describe a set of properties in STL that are used to evaluate the performance of their models. I will check if there is a citation that discusses these properties in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that they are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
