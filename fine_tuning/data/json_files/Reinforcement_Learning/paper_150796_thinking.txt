To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameterizing pressure-temperature profiles of exoplanet atmospheres with neural networks" by Timothy D. Gebhard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors validate their approach using "two publicly available datasets of self-consistent PT profiles," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. This section is likely to contain the names, characteristics, and relevant citations for each dataset.

In **subsection 3.1 (PyATMOS)**, the authors describe the PyATMOS dataset, generated by Chopra et al. (2023). It consists of 124,314 stable atmospheres of Earth-like planets and includes specific details about the atmospheric layers and quantities available. The citation for this dataset is:
> Chopra, A., Bell, A. C., et al. 2023, arXiv preprints [2308.10624].

In **subsection 3.2 (Goyal-2020)**, the authors discuss the Goyal-2020 dataset, which contains 11,293 PT profiles corresponding to 89 hot Jupiters. The citation for this dataset is:
> Goyal, J. M., Mayne, N., et al. 2020, MNRAS, 498, 4680.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, such as the number of profiles, the types of atmospheres represented, and any additional information provided by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further analysis of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
