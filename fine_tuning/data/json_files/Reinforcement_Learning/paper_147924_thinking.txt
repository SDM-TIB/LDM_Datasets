To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decorrelation" by Borislav Mavrin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on **49 Atari games**, which suggests that these games may be part of a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly looking for any subsections that discuss the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention using the **Atari game environments** as a benchmark for their experiments. This indicates that the Atari games serve as the dataset for their evaluation.

I will then compile a list of the specific Atari games mentioned in the paper. The paper provides a table listing the games along with their performance scores under different algorithms. This table serves as a comprehensive reference for the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the Atari game dataset. The Atari games are commonly referenced in the literature, and I can use the following citation for the dataset:

- For the **Atari game environments**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279.

After gathering this information, I will create entries for the dataset using the specified format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari game environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
