To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Believe What You See: Implicit Constraint Approach for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Yiqin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of offline multi-agent reinforcement learning and mentions the use of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which often includes the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**. Specifically, they refer to datasets used in the context of multi-agent tasks based on **StarCraft II** and **D4RL** benchmarks. 

1. **StarCraft II Datasets**: The authors mention that they constructed multi-agent offline datasets based on ten maps in StarCraft II, which include various difficulty levels and behaviors. However, they do not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are likely derived from the game's environment.

2. **D4RL Datasets**: The authors also refer to the D4RL benchmark, which includes several datasets for offline reinforcement learning tasks. They specifically mention tasks such as **Adroit** and **AntMaze**.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The D4RL benchmark is cited as follows:

- For D4RL:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Oﬁr Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

For the StarCraft II datasets, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference the original StarCraft multi-agent challenge paper:

- For StarCraft II:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft multi-agent challenge*. In International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pages 2186–2188, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
