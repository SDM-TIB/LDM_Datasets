To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-speed Opto-electronic Pre-processing of Polar Mellin Transform for Shift, Scale and Rotation Invariant Image Recognition at Record-Breaking Speeds" by Julian Gamboa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of data sources or datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental results section**. This section often details the datasets used for testing and validation of the proposed methods. I will note any specific datasets mentioned, including their names and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of images for testing their opto-electronic PMT pre-processor. They mention using "real-world images" and provide examples of images of a Reaper drone. However, they do not specify a formal dataset name or provide a structured dataset description. I will need to clarify if these images are part of a publicly available dataset or if they are proprietary.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that may refer to datasets or image collections used in the experiments. If the authors reference other works that include datasets, I will extract those citations as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
