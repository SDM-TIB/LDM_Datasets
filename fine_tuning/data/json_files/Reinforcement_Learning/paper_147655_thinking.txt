To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trust Region Policy Optimization" by John Schulman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on various tasks, including simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking, as well as playing Atari games. This suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 8) to find specific datasets used for the experiments. The authors mention using the **MuJoCo simulator** for robotic locomotion tasks and the **Arcade Learning Environment** for Atari games. I will look for any specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these environments.

In the experiments, the authors describe their evaluation on several Atari games, including **Breakout**, **Enduro**, **Pong**, **Q*bert**, **Seaquest**, and **Space Invaders**. These games are part of the Arcade Learning Environment, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned:

1. **MuJoCo Simulator**: The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In *Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on* (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

2. **Arcade Learning Environment**: The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Next, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
