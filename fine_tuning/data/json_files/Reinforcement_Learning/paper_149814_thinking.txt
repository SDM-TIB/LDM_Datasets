To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R2D2: Robust Data-to-Text with Replacement Detection" by Linyong Nan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three Data-to-Text datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **FeTaQA**: A free-form table question answering dataset that requires retrieving and generating answers based on table contents.
2. **LogicNLG**: A table-to-text dataset that tasks models with generating logically entailed sentences from tables.
3. **ToTTo**: A table-to-text dataset that includes annotations of salient content of tables.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **FeTaQA**:
  > Linyong Nan, Chiachun Hsieh, Ziming Mao, Xi Victoria Lin, Neha Verma, Rui Zhang, Wojciech Kryściński, Nick Schoelkopf, Riley Kong, Xiangru Tang, Mutethia Mutuma, Ben Rosand, Isabel Trindade, Renusree Bandaru, Jacob Cunningham, Caiming Xiong, and Dragomir Radev. *FeTaQA: Free-form Table Question Answering*. In Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:35–49, 2022.

- For **LogicNLG**:
  > Wenhu Chen, Hongmin Wang, Jianshu Chen, Yunkai Zhang, Hong Wang, Shiyang Li, Xiyou Zhou, and William Yang Wang. *Logical natural language generation from open-domain tables*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7929–7942, 2020.

- For **ToTTo**:
  > Ankur Parikh, Xuezhi Wang, Sebastian Gehrmann, Manaal Faruqui, Bhuwan Dhingra, Diyi Yang, and Dipanjan Das. *ToTTo: A controlled table-to-text generation dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1173–1186, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
