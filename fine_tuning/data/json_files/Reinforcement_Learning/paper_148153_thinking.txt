To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIGhER: Improving instruction following with Hindsight Generation for Experience Replay" by Geoffrey Cideron et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and mentions the use of the **BabyAI environment**, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or a platform used for experiments.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Minigrid** environment, which is a visual domain for instruction-following tasks. This indicates that Minigrid is likely a dataset or a collection of tasks used in their experiments.

In this section, the authors detail the characteristics of the Minigrid environment, including the number of objects and attributes, which further confirms its role as a dataset for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

1. **BabyAI**: The citation for the BabyAI environment is:
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert et al. "BabyAI: First Steps Towards Grounded Language Learning With a Human In the Loop". In: Proceedings of ICLR, 2019. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX.

2. **Minigrid**: The citation for the Minigrid environment is:
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert et al. "BabyAI: First Steps Towards Grounded Language Learning With a Human In the Loop". In: Proceedings of ICLR, 2019. URL: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key features of each dataset and ensuring that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in the final output.
