To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Continuous Control with Double Actors and Regularized Critics" by Jiafei Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will note those names as they may not provide full citations within the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper. This section is crucial for obtaining full citations for each dataset. I will look for any papers or resources cited that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the experiments section. If a dataset is a well-known benchmark, I will ensure to find its original citation.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** or **MuJoCo** environments, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these environments. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. The full citation for the dataset, formatted correctly.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review. This systematic approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
