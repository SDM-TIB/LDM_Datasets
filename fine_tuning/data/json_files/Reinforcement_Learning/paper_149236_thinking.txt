To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Set Wireless Standard Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Samuel R. Shebert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their classifier on various wireless signal standards, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset Generation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. They mention that all signal datasets were generated in MATLAB, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

In this section, the authors specify the known classes used for training the classifier, which include:

1. **4G LTE & 5G NR**: The authors state that these signals were generated to be compliant with specific releases using the MATLAB LTE and 5G Toolboxes. This indicates that the dataset is based on simulated signals adhering to industry standards.

2. **IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6)**: This dataset was generated using the MATLAB WLAN Toolbox, which includes various packet formats. This is another clear dataset that I need to note.

3. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0**: The authors mention that BLE signals were generated using the MATLAB Communications Toolbox Library for Bluetooth. This is another dataset to include.

4. **Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT)**: The authors specify that NB-IoT downlink signals were generated to be compliant with a specific release using the MATLAB LTE Toolbox.

The authors also describe the **unknown classes** used for testing the classifier, which include:

1. **OFDM, SC-FDMA, & SC**: These are generic waveforms used in many standards, but the signals in this dataset lack the specific structures found in the known classes.

2. **AM & FM**: The authors mention that these analog modulations were included as unknown classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated using MATLAB and do not refer to external datasets, I will note that the citations for the standards themselves are not provided in the references. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

The datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **4G LTE & 5G NR**: Generated using MATLAB LTE Toolbox and MATLAB 5G Toolbox. The specific citation for the toolboxes is not provided, but they are widely recognized in the field.

2. **IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6)**: Generated using MATLAB WLAN Toolbox. Again, the specific citation for the toolbox is not provided.

3. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0**: Generated using MATLAB Communications Toolbox Library for Bluetooth. The specific citation for the toolbox is not provided.

4. **Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT)**: Generated using MATLAB LTE Toolbox. The specific citation for the toolbox is not provided.

5. **OFDM, SC-FDMA, & SC**: These are generic waveforms and do not have a specific citation as they are not derived from a particular dataset.

6. **AM & FM**: These are standard modulation techniques and do not have a specific citation as they are widely recognized in the field.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its context, ensuring that I include any relevant citations or references where applicable.
