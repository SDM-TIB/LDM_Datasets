To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Infrastructure LiDAR Placement with Realistic LiDAR Simulation Library" by Xinyu Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of a Realistic LiDAR Simulation (RLS) library, which suggests that there may be datasets related to LiDAR simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the CARLA simulator for data collection, which indicates that the data generated from this simulator may be a key dataset.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **related work section** or **conclusion** that might provide additional context or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of the **OPV2V dataset** for training and testing their models. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I need to ensure I capture its details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OPV2V dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xu, R., Xiang, H., Xia, X., Han, X., Li, J., & Ma, J. (2022). OPV2V: An open benchmark dataset and fusion pipeline for perception with vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) (pp. 2583â€“2589). IEEE.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the RLS library, which simulates various LiDAR devices but does not refer to a specific dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it generates point cloud data based on the simulation of different LiDAR placements.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:

1. **OPV2V Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the perception models in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
