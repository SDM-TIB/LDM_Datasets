To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stroke-based Character Reconstruction" by Zhewei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a method for character reconstruction and hints at the use of synthetic data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST**: The authors describe MNIST as containing 70,000 examples of hand-written digits, with specific details about the training and testing splits. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **SVHN**: The paper describes the SVHN dataset as a real-world image dataset with over 600,000 digit images. The authors provide details about the nature of the images and their resolution.

3. **Synthetic SVHN**: The authors explain how they generated a synthetic dataset by using 250 fonts to create 2,500 Arabic numerals and 2,500 images from the MNIST training set. They provide details about the generation process, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **Synthetic SVHN**, since it is a dataset generated by the authors, I will reference the paper itself as the source of this dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their proper references.
