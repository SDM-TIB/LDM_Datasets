To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Reasoning for Bias Evaluation and Detection in a Fairness under Unawareness setting" by Giandomenico Cornacchia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the research. In the introduction, the authors may discuss the context and significance of the datasets, which could help identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: 

1. **Adult Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for income prediction, which contains demographic information about individuals.
2. **Adult-debiased Dataset**: This dataset is a modified version of the Adult dataset, where sensitive features have been removed to assess fairness.
3. **German Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting credit default and contains various demographic features.
4. **Crime Dataset**: This dataset is a census dataset used for predicting violent states based on crime statistics.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about each dataset, including the number of samples, features, and the target variable. This information is crucial for accurately describing each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. *UCI Adult Data Set*. UCI Machine Learning Repository, May 1996.

- For the **German Dataset**:
  > Hans Hofmann. *UCI Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set*. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2000.

- For the **Crime Dataset**:
  > Michael Redmond. *UCI Communities and Crime Data Set*. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1995.

- The **Adult-debiased Dataset** is derived from the Adult dataset and does not have a separate citation, as it is a modified version of the original dataset.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
