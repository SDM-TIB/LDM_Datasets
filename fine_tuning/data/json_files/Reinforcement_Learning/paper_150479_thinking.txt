To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking the Physical-world Adversarial Robustness of Vehicle Detection" by Tianyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a dataset called the **DCI dataset** using the CARLA simulator, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (DCI Dataset: Instant-level Scene Generation and Design)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the DCI dataset. They explain that this dataset is designed to evaluate vehicle detection models under various scenarios, and it consists of two parts: the **Continuous part** and the **Discrete part**. 

1. **DCI Dataset**: The authors describe the DCI dataset as covering 7 continuous and 1 discrete scenes, with over 40 angles, 20 distances, and 20,000 positions. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on adversarial robustness.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the DCI dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces its importance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is the tool used to generate the DCI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CARLA simulator**:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL, 2017.

Since the DCI dataset is generated using the CARLA simulator, I will cite the CARLA simulator as the source for the DCI dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the source of the DCI dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the DCI dataset, ready for further processing or review.
