To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Load Models and Their Impacts on Power Transfer Limits" by Xinan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on load models and their impact on power transfer limits, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section II (Introduction of Load Models)**, where the authors discuss various load models such as the ZIP model, ZIP + IM model, and WECC composite load model. I will look for any specific datasets or references to data sources that may have been used to validate these models.

In **section III (Reinforcement Learning-Based Load Modeling Control)**, the authors describe their methodology for fitting load models to historical event records. I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used for training or validation purposes, particularly any specific datasets that may have been referenced.

I will also check the **case study section (IV)**, where the authors conduct evaluations using the IEEE 39-bus system. This section may contain references to datasets or simulation environments that were utilized in their experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete references for each dataset.

Based on my reading, I anticipate that the following datasets will be relevant:

1. **IEEE 39-bus system**: This is a well-known test system used in power system studies. The citation for this dataset is:
   > "IEEE 39-Bus System," IEEE Power and Energy Society, 2016.

2. **WECC Composite Load Model**: This model is referenced in the context of dynamic load modeling. The citation for this dataset is:
   > NERC Technical Reference Document: "A Look into Load Modeling: The Composite Load Model," Sep. 2015.

3. **ZIP Load Model**: This model is commonly used in power system analysis. The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. Arif et al., "Load Modelingâ€”A Review," IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, vol. 9, no. 6, pp. 5986-5999, Nov. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
