To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Show Us the Way: Learning to Manage Dialog from Demonstrations" by Gabriel Gordon-Hall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the submission to the End-to-End Multi-Domain Dialog Challenge, which suggests that datasets related to dialog systems are likely discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **MultiWOZ dataset**, which is a large-scale multi-domain dataset used for training dialog systems. This is a key dataset that I need to note down.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **MultiWOZ dataset** for training and evaluation. They also reference **ConvLab**, which is a framework that includes various datasets and tools for dialog system development. However, the focus here is on the MultiWOZ dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For **MultiWOZ**:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Stefan, U., Osman, R., & Gašić, M. (2018). *MultiWOZ - A large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2018, 5016–5026.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MultiWOZ dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
