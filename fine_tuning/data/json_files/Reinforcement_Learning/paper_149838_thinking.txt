To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Gradient Algorithms with Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Non-Markov Decision Processes" by Tetsuro Morimura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions of each dataset. This section may provide insights into the purpose of each dataset, how it was collected, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses a dataset called "Synthetic HDP Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in other papers or online resources.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I provide accurate citations for each one.
