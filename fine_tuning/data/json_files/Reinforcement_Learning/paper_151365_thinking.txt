To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Visual Task Vectors" by Alberto Hojel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the analysis of activations in the MAE-VQGAN model, but it does not specify datasets at this point. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **subsection 4.3 (Downstream Tasks)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Pascal-5i dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as containing 4 different image splits, with each split comprising between 346 and 725 images and associated segmentation masks.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Pascal-5i dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Shaban, A., Bansal, S., Liu, Z., Essa, I., & Boots, B. (2017). *One-shot learning for semantic segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03410.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Pascal-5i dataset** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will help in maintaining proper attribution and allow others to reference the dataset correctly in their work.
