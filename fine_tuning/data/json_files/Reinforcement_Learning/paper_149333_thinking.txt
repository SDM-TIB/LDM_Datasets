To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Profiling Neural Blocks and Design Spaces for Mobile Neural Architecture Search" by Keith G. Mills et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses profiling neural blocks and mentions various hardware devices, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors reference the **ImageNet** dataset as a benchmarking dataset for evaluating the performance of neural architectures. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision, and I will need to document it.

Moving on to the **background section**, I will look for any additional datasets that might be referenced. The authors describe the design spaces of Once-for-All (OFA), ProxylessNAS, and ResNet50, but they do not introduce any new datasets here.

In the **data collection section**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet validation set** for accuracy measurement. This confirms that ImageNet is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any other datasets mentioned. However, the focus remains on the performance metrics derived from the ImageNet dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections to identify any datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the ImageNet dataset in the data collection section.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the ImageNet dataset from the references section.

This process ensures that I accurately document the datasets referenced in the paper, particularly focusing on the importance of providing full citations.
