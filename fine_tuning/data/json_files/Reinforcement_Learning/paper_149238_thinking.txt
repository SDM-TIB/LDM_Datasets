To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jiechuan Jiang and Zongqing Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of offline reinforcement learning and hints at the use of datasets for training agents. The introduction elaborates on the offline decentralized multi-agent setting and mentions that each agent learns from its own fixed dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Multi-Agent Mujoco**: The paper states that they collected datasets for each agent in the multi-agent Mujoco environment, which contains 1 × 10^6 transitions for each agent. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed framework.

2. **SMAC (StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge)**: The authors also mention using datasets from SMAC, which includes various scenarios like 3m, 8m, 3s_vs_3z, and 3s_vs_4z. Each dataset contains 10,000 episodes.

3. **D4RL (Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning)**: The paper references the D4RL datasets, which are used for evaluating offline reinforcement learning methods.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **Multi-Agent Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Christian Schroeder de Witt, Bei Peng, Pierre-Alexandre Kamienny, Philip Torr, Wendelin Böhmer, and Shimon Whiteson. *Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Continuous Cooperative Control*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.06709, 2020.

- For **SMAC**, the citation is:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim G. J. Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philiph H. S. Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. CoRR, abs/1902.04043, 2019.

- For **D4RL**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
