To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What model does MuZero learn?" by Jinke He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Policy Evaluation Experiments)** and **section 4 (Policy Improvement Experiments)**. These sections often detail the experiments conducted, including the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In section 3.1, the authors mention training MuZero agents in three environments: **Cart Pole**, **Lunar Lander**, and **Atari Breakout**. These environments are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research, but I need to confirm if they are publicly available datasets or if they refer to specific implementations.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to these environments. For instance, the Atari environments are often associated with the following citation:

- For **Atari Breakout**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

For **Cart Pole** and **Lunar Lander**, these are standard environments in OpenAI's Gym, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference or downstream processing.
