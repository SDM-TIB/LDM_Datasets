To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EpiTESTER: Testing Autonomous Vehicles with Epigenetic Algorithm and Attention Mechanism" by Chengjie Lu, Shaukat Ali, and Tao Yue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using **four initial environments from CARLA**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation process and mention that they used **CARLA**, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, to create various test scenarios. This implies that CARLA itself is a dataset or a source of datasets for the experiments.

I will also check the **background section** for any references to datasets used in previous studies or related works. The authors mention using **Interfuser**, a state-of-the-art AV controller, which may also be associated with specific datasets.

In the **experiment design section**, the authors discuss the creation of a dataset by running a random strategy, resulting in about **25,000 samples** labeled with fitness values. They filtered this dataset to obtain around **5,000 samples** for training their epigenetic model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: 
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1-16). PMLR.

2. **Interfuser**: 
   > Shao, H., Wang, L., Chen, R., Li, H., & Liu, Y. (2023). *Safety-enhanced autonomous driving using interpretable sensor fusion transformer*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 726-737). PMLR.

3. **Dataset from Random Strategy**: 
   > This dataset is not attributed to a specific paper but is derived from the authors' experiments using the CARLA simulator.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation for future reference. This will facilitate easy access to the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
