To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Program-Triggered Reinforcement Learning Agents For Automated Driving" by Briti Gangopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and empirical studies sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed framework using **CARLA**, an open-source dynamic urban simulation environment, which suggests that CARLA may be a dataset or simulation environment used for experiments.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** for any specific datasets or scenarios that the authors used in their experiments. In this section, they describe a **Four-Way Intersection Scenario** and various driving tasks, but I need to confirm if these tasks are based on specific datasets or if they are simulations created within CARLA.

In the **empirical studies section**, the authors mention testing their framework on **10 NHTSA inspired pre-crash scenarios** modeled in CARLA. This indicates that the scenarios are likely derived from real-world data or standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but I need to find the exact references or citations for these datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for CARLA and any other datasets mentioned. The paper cites CARLA as an open urban driving simulator, and I will need to provide its full citation:

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of the NHTSA scenarios or any other driving datasets that may have been referenced throughout the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
