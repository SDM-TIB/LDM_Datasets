To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning for Sample-Efficient Multiagent Coordination" by Shauharda Khadka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention using environments from previous works, specifically citing "Lowe et al., 2017" and "Rahmattalabi et al., 2016." I will need to find out if these references correspond to specific datasets or benchmarks.

In section 5, the authors describe four environments used for their experiments:

1. **Predator-Prey**: This environment involves multiple agents (predators) chasing a faster adversary (prey). The dataset is implicitly defined by the rules of the environment rather than a traditional dataset.

2. **Physical Deception**: Similar to Predator-Prey, this environment is defined by its mechanics rather than a specific dataset.

3. **Keep-Away**: Again, this environment is described in terms of its dynamics rather than a dataset.

4. **Rover Domain**: This environment is adapted from a previous work, specifically referencing "Rahmattalabi et al., 2016."

Since these environments are not traditional datasets but rather experimental setups, I will need to look at the references to find the original sources that might provide more information about the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the works mentioned:

- For **Lowe et al., 2017**, the citation is:
  > R. Lowe, Y. Wu, A. Tamar, J. Harb, O. P. Abbeel, and I. Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 6379–6390, 2017.

- For **Rahmattalabi et al., 2016**, the citation is:
  > A. Rahmattalabi, J. J. Chung, M. Colby, and K. Tumer. *D++: Structural credit assignment in tightly coupled multiagent domains*. In 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 4424–4429. IEEE, 2016.

Since the environments are derived from these references, I will treat them as the sources for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment referenced in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
