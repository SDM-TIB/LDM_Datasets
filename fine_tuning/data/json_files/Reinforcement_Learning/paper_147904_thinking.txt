To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Episodic Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient: Towards Continuous Control in Computationally Complex Environments" by Zhizheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method, AE-DDPG, is evaluated on a specific task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the **Learning to Run (L2R) environment** and **MuJoCo environments**. I will look for specific details about these environments to understand their structure and purpose.

1. **Learning to Run (L2R) Environment**: This environment is implemented in OpenSim and is designed for controlling a musculoskeletal model to navigate an obstacle course. The authors provide details about the action vector and observation vector, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **MuJoCo Environments**: The paper mentions six continuous control tasks from the MuJoCo physics engine, specifically: Ant-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Humanoid-v2, Swimmer-v2, and Walker2d-v2. Each of these tasks involves controlling different robotic models to perform specific actions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned:

- For the **Learning to Run Challenge**, the citation is:

F., Huang, Z., Zhou, S., Pechenko, A., Stelmaszczyk, A., Jarosik, P., Pavlov, M., Kolesnikov, S., Plis, S., Chen, Z., Zhang, Z., Chen, J., Shi, Z., Zheng, C., Yuan, Z., Lin, H., Michalewski, H., & Delp, S. (2018). Learning to Run Challenge Solutions: Adapting Reinforcement Learning Methods for Neuromusculoskeletal Environments. In Proceedings of the Learning to Run Challenge, pp. 121–153.

- For the **MuJoCo environments**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
