To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Unsupervised Video Game Playstyle Metric via State Discretization" by Chiu-Chou Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on various video game platforms, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). Here, the authors describe their experiments on three video game platforms: **TORCS**, **RGSK**, and **seven Atari games**. I will note down these platforms as they likely correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

In **Section 5.1 (TORCS)**, the authors detail the creation of 25 datasets based on different speed and noise levels. They mention that each dataset represents a unique playstyle, which is crucial for my extraction. I will summarize this as follows:
- **TORCS Datasets**: 25 datasets created from varying speeds (60, 65, 70, 75, 80) and noise levels (n1 to n5).

In **Section 5.2 (RGSK)**, the authors describe datasets collected from human players, where each player maintains a consistent playstyle. They mention that six datasets (C1 to C6) were collected from six players. I will summarize this as:
- **RGSK Datasets**: 6 datasets collected from human players, each representing a unique playstyle.

In **Section 5.3 (Atari Games)**, the authors mention that they used datasets generated from 20 different agents trained using various reinforcement learning algorithms. This indicates that there are multiple datasets corresponding to different agents. I will summarize this as:
- **Atari Datasets**: 20 datasets generated from agents trained by different RL algorithms (DQN, C51, Rainbow, IQN).

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations for the games/platforms used are as follows:

1. **TORCS**:
   > Bernhard Wymann, Christos Dimitrakakis, Andrew Sumner, Eric EspiÃ©, and Christophe Guionneau. *Torcs: The Open Racing Car Simulator*. http://www.torcs.org, 2014.

2. **RGSK**:
   > Unity Technologies. *Unity ML-Agents Toolkit*. https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents, 2018.

3. **Atari Games**:
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately extracted and documented for further use or analysis.
