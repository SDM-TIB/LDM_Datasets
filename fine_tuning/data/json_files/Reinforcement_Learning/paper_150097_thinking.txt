To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithmic Trading Using Continuous Action Space" by Naseh Majidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of historical data for price movement prediction in financial markets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their approach. In **subsection 4.1 (State Space)**, they mention using **candlestick datasets** that include open, close, high, low prices, and volume. However, I need to look for specific datasets that are referenced or used in their experiments.

In **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors state that the dataset was acquired from the **Yahoo Finance API**, which contains the close price of Bitcoin (BTC) from 2014-10-15 to 2020-01-01 and Amazon (AMZN) from 2010-01-01 to 2021-06-01. This provides me with the specific datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Bitcoin dataset**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Data for Bitcoin (BTC)*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD.

- For the **Amazon dataset**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Data for Amazon (AMZN)*. Retrieved from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/history?p=AMZN.

With these citations, I have identified the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
