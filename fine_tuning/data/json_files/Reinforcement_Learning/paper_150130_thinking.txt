To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEAR: Generative Counterfactual Explanations on Graphs" by Jing Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Community Dataset**: This dataset consists of synthetic graphs generated by the Erdös-Rényi (E-R) model. It contains 10,000 graphs, each with an average of 20 nodes and 45 edges. The label is determined by the average node degree in one of the communities.

2. **Ogbg-molhiv Dataset**: This dataset represents molecules, where each graph corresponds to a molecule with nodes as atoms and edges as chemical bonds. It contains 31,957 graphs, with an average of 20.8 nodes and 22.4 edges.

3. **IMDB-M Dataset**: This dataset consists of movie collaboration networks from IMDB, with 1,160 graphs, an average of 9.4 nodes, and 32.8 edges. Each node represents an actor or actress, and edges represent collaborations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions the following references:

- For the **Community Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Erdős and A. Rényi. *On random graphs I*. Publicationes Mathematicae (Debrecen), 1959.

- For the **Ogbg-molhiv Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhenqin Wu et al. *Moleculenet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 2018.

- For the **IMDB-M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Predict grant applications. *https://www.kaggle.com/c/unimelb*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
