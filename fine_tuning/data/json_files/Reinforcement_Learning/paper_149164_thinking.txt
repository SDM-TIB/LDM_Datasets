To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Plan via a Multi-Step Policy Regression Method" by Stefan Wagner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions testing the proposed method on the **MiniGrid** and **Pong** environments, indicating that these environments may be datasets or benchmarks used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on two environments: **MiniGrid** and **Pong-Deterministic-v4**. I will note down these environments as they are crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **MiniGrid** environments, specifically mentioning the **MultiRoom** and **Crossing** environments. They also refer to the **Pong-Deterministic-v4** environment from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). This confirms that these environments are indeed datasets or benchmarks used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MiniGrid environments**, the citation is:
   > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., Pal, S. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for openai gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid (2018).

2. For the **Pong-Deterministic-v4 environment**, the citation is:
   > Bellemare, M.G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., Bowling, M. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv e-prints arXiv:1207.4708 (Jul 2012).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
