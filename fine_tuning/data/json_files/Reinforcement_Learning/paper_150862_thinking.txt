To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing User-Centric Behavioral Interventions to Prevent Dysglycemia with Novel Counterfactual Explanations" by Asiful Arefeen and Hassan Ghasemzadeh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework using "two real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Nutrition Absorption Dataset**: This dataset includes continuous glucose monitor (CGM) recordings from 5 participants with various diabetes types. It contains data on meal macronutrients, time since the last insulin dose, pre-meal blood glucose levels, and CGM data for four hours post-meal.

2. **OhioT1DM Dataset**: This dataset is derived from an eight-week clinical study involving 12 deidentified T1 diabetes patients. It includes physiological data recorded from wristbands and self-reported dietary and exercise information. The target class categorizes post-prandial glycemic responses into hyperglycemia and normoglycemia.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Nutrition Absorption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karim, R. A. H., Vassányi, I., & Kósa, I. (2020). After-meal blood glucose level prediction using an absorption model for neural network training. *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, 125, 103956.

- For the **OhioT1DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marling, C. R., & Bunescu, R. C. (2020). The OhioT1DM Dataset for Blood Glucose Level Prediction: Update 2020. *CEUR Workshop Proceedings*, 2675, 71–74.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
