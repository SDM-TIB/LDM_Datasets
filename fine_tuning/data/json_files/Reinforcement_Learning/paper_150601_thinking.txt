To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Differentiable Clustering with Associative Memories" by Bishwajit Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their evaluations are conducted on "varied datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical evaluations in section 4, where they mention that they evaluate ClAM on "10 datasets of varying sizes." They also provide a table (Table 4) that lists these datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of points, features, and classes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Zoo Dataset**: Contains 101 points with 16 features and 7 classes.
2. **Yale Dataset**: Contains 165 points with 1024 features and 15 classes.
3. **GCM Dataset**: Contains 360 points with 1080 features and 15 classes.
4. **Ecoli Dataset**: Contains 2007 points with 256 features and 8 classes.
5. **Movement Libras Dataset**: Contains 2126 points with 19 features and 7 classes.
6. **Mice Protein Expression Dataset**: Contains 2310 points with 77 features and 10 classes.
7. **USPS Dataset**: Contains 60000 points with 784 features and 10 classes.
8. **CTG Dataset**: Contains 2126 points with 21 features and 10 classes.
9. **Segment Dataset**: Contains 2310 points with 19 features and 7 classes.
10. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: Contains 60000 points with 784 features and 10 classes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites various sources for the datasets, and I will need to ensure that I capture the correct references for each dataset.

For example, the citations for some of the datasets are as follows:

- **Zoo Dataset**: 
  > "Zoo" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua et al., 2017).
  
- **Yale Dataset**: 
  > "Yale" dataset from the ASU feature selection repository (Li et al., 2017).

- **USPS Dataset**: 
  > Hull, J. J. (1994). "A database for handwritten text recognition." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
