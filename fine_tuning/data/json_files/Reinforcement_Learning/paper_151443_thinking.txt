To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Reconstruction Using Counterfactual Explanations: Mitigating the Decision Boundary Shift" by Pasan Dissanayake and Sanghamitra Dutta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 based on various features. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Becker, B.; and Kohavi, R. 1996. *Adult*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating reoffending risks of criminal defendants. The citation is:
   > Angwin, J.; Larson, J.; Mattu, S.; and Kirchner, L. 2016. *Machine Bias*. ProPublica.

3. **DCCC Dataset**: This dataset includes information about credit card clients in Taiwan, used to predict defaults. The citation is:
   > Yeh, I.-C. 2016. *Default of Credit Card Clients*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C55S3H.

4. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains information about customers requesting a credit line based on home equity. The citation is:
   > FICO. 2018. *Explainable Machine Learning Challenge*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the number of instances and features.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
