To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experience Replay for Continual Learning" by David Rolnick et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the CLEAR method and its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic forgetting, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the challenges of continual learning and does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any experiments that involve specific datasets. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention using the **DMLab set of environments** for their experiments. This indicates that DMLab is a dataset used in their evaluations.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DMLab dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Charles Beattie, Joel Z Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, et al. *DeepMind Lab*. Preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered. The only dataset identified is the DMLab set of environments, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in this research.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for DMLab, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

In summary, I have identified one dataset from the paper, and I will document it accordingly.
