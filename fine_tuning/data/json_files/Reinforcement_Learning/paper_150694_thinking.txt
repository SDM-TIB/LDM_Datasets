To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Defect Classification in Additive Manufacturing Using CNN-Based Vision Processing" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses using CNNs for classifying defects in an image dataset from additive manufacturing (AM). This suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** and **Classification Experiments** sections for specific details about the datasets used. In the Classification Experiments section, the authors mention using an open image dataset from **Westphal and Seitz (2021)**, which contains 4,000 images divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In the **Introduction**, the authors reference the **Pascal VOC** dataset as an example of a large, openly available dataset, but it is not used in their experiments. Therefore, I will focus on the dataset explicitly used for their classification tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

1. **Open Image Dataset from Westphal and Seitz (2021)**: This dataset is used for defect detection in additive manufacturing and is referenced in the paper. The citation is:
   > Westphal, E. and Seitz, H. (2021). A machine learning method for defect detection and visualization in selective laser sintering based on convolutional neural networks. *Additive Manufacturing*, 41:101965.

Next, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will not include any additional datasets that are not directly used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all necessary details are included and that the citation is accurate and complete.
