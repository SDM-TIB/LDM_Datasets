To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperTree Proof Search for Neural Theorem Proving" by Guillaume Lample et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and datasets**. The abstract mentions that the authors report performance on "three environments of increasing complexity," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proving environments)**, where the authors describe three theorem proving environments: **Metamath**, **Lean**, and **Equations**. Each of these environments likely corresponds to a dataset used in their experiments.

1. **Metamath**: The authors mention a database of 30,000 human-written theorems called **set.mm**. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

2. **Lean**: They refer to a human-written library of 27,000 theorems called **Mathlib**. This dataset is also crucial for their evaluation.

3. **Equations**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset generated from random theorems and their proofs, which is not a traditional dataset but is still relevant for their experiments.

In **section 6.1 (Model fine-tuning and supervised datasets)**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used for fine-tuning their models:

- For **Metamath**, they extracted all proofs from the **set.mm** library, which contains 37,091 theorems. They created a training set of around 1 million goal-tactic pairs.

- For **Lean**, they used a dataset from the **Mathlib** library, which consists of 24,000 theorems and 144,000 goal-tactic pairs.

- For **Equations**, they generated a synthetic dataset of theorems and their proofs, as there is no existing dataset of manually annotated proofs.

Now, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **Metamath (set.mm)**, the citation is:
  > Norman D. Megill and David A. Wheeler. *Metamath: A Computer Language for Mathematical Proofs*. Lulu Press, Morrisville, North Carolina, 2019. URL: http://us.metamath.org/downloads/metamath.pdf.

- For **Lean (Mathlib)**, the citation is:
  > The mathlib Community. *The Lean Mathematical Library*. In Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs. ACM, January 2020. doi: 10.1145/3372885.3373824. URL: https://doi.org/10.1145/3372885.3373824.

- For the **Equations environment**, since it is based on synthetic data generated by the authors, there may not be a formal citation, but I will note that it is a novel dataset created for the purposes of this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
