To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Trade-off between Plausibility, Change Intensity and Adversarial Power in Counterfactual Explanations using Multi-objective Optimization" by Javier Del Ser et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may reference datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section is crucial as it often includes the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the following subsections:

1. **4.1 (Considered GAN Architectures)**: This section may describe the datasets used to train the GAN models.
2. **4.2 (Audited Classification Models)**: This subsection will likely detail the datasets used for training the classification models that are audited in the experiments.
3. **4.3 (Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm)**: While this section focuses on the optimization algorithm, it may also reference datasets indirectly through the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CelebA dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference/journal, and year of publication. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of its contents and purpose
- The full citation as found in the references

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
