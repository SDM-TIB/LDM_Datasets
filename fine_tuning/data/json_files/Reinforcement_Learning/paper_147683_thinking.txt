To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi Exit Configuration of Mesoscopic Pedestrian Simulation" by Allan Lao and Kardi Teknomo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss pedestrian dynamics and various modeling approaches but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their mesoscopic model and the Q-learning algorithm. Here, they mention the use of a simulation model but do not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **simulation results section**. The authors describe two scenarios involving pedestrian movement in a simulated environment but do not reference any external datasets. Instead, they focus on the configuration of exits and the behavior of pedestrians in the simulated environment.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for validation or comparison, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their simulations. Instead, they created their own simulated environments for the purpose of their study. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research paper.**
2. **The authors focused on a simulation model rather than external datasets.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of a research paper to identify datasets, even when they may not be explicitly stated.
