To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Online Exploration via Coverability" by Philip Amortila et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a summary of the key contributions and may highlight the datasets used for experiments.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets. This could include sections titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the identified sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific characteristics that are important for understanding their use in the research.

4. **Check the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
   - **Citation**: The full citation from the references section that provides the source of the dataset.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly presented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
