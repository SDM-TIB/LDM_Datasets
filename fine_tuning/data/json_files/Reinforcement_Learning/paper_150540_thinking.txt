To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based QoE-aware Digital Twin Empowered Edge Computing for Immersive Virtual Reality" by Jiadong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework using extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of an **eye gaze dataset** collected from participants using a VR headset. They describe how this dataset was created by combining eye gaze coordinate data files from different users and videos, resulting in a substantial amount of data for analysis.

The paper also specifies that the dataset consists of **208 HD dynamic 360° videos sourced from YouTube**, which were used during user experiments. This indicates that the dataset is not only extensive but also diverse in content.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Eye Gaze Dataset**: The dataset was created from the eye tracking data collected during the experiments. The citation for the eye gaze dataset is:
   > Xu, Y., Dong, Y., Wu, J., Sun, Z., Shi, Z., Yu, J., & Gao, S. (2018). Gaze prediction in dynamic 360° immersive videos. In 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 5333–5342).

2. **360° Video Dataset**: The dataset consists of 208 HD dynamic 360° videos sourced from YouTube. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yu, J., Alhilal, A., Hui, P., & Tsang, D. H. K. (2022). 6G mobile-edge empowered metaverse: Requirements, technologies, challenges and research directions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.04854.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
