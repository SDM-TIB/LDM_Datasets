To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Speaker Adaptation for Text-to-Speech Synthesis" by Hamed Hemati and Damian Borth, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training multi-speaker TTS models and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, which suggests that datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their framework and the datasets used. In **subsection 2.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets utilized in their experiments:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset is used for English language experiments and is noted for its multi-speaker characteristics. The authors reference it as a well-known corpus for TTS tasks.

2. **CommonVoice-DE (CVDE)**: This dataset is used for German language experiments and is provided by Mozilla. It is also a multi-speaker dataset, which aligns with the paper's focus on continual learning for TTS.

Additionally, the authors mention using **LJSpeech** and **CSS10-DE** as single-speaker datasets for pre-training purposes. These datasets are important for understanding the experimental setup and the continual learning framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **VCTK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yamagishi, J., Veaux, C., & MacDonald, K. (2019). *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*.

- For **CommonVoice-DE (CVDE)**, the citation is:
  > Park, K., & Mulc, T. (2019). *CSS10: A collection of single speaker speech datasets for 10 languages*. Interspeech.

- For **LJSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Ito, K., & Johnson, L. (2017). *The LJ Speech Dataset*. Retrieved from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

- For **CSS10-DE**, the citation is:
  > Park, K., & Mulc, T. (2019). *CSS10: A collection of single speaker speech datasets for 10 languages*. Interspeech.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
