To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent-CF: A Simple Baseline for Reverse Counterfactual Explanations" by Rachana Balasubramanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses counterfactual explanations and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly **section 2.3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for digit classification tasks. The authors reference the original source of the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **Lending Club Loan Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting loan outcomes. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is also important for proper citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y.; Cortes, C.; and Burges, C. 2010. MNIST handwritten digit database. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For the **Lending Club Loan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > George, N. 2018. All Lending Club loan data. https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club. Accessed: 2021-01-30.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
