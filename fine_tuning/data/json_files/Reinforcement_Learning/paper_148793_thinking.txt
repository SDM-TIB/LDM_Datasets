To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Based Fractional Order Controller Design for Process Plants Satisfying Desired Robustness Criteria" by Pushkar Prakash Arya and Sohom Chakrabarty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and any datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their proposed controller design. If the authors mention specific datasets or models, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or simulations. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **examples section**, as it may provide practical applications of the proposed methods using specific datasets. If the authors present case studies or examples, I will look for any datasets referenced in those examples.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
