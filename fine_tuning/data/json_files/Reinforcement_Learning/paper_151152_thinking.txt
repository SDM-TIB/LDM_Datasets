To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast gradient-free activation maximization for neurons in spiking neural networks" by Nikita Pospelov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using CIFAR-10-size color images generated by VQ-VAE or SN-GAN, which indicates that CIFAR-10 is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **Methods** section. In this section, the authors describe the use of the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, split into 10 classes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments involving spiking neural networks.

I will also check the **Acknowledgements** and **References** sections to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CIFAR-10 dataset citation is as follows:
- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on this one.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
