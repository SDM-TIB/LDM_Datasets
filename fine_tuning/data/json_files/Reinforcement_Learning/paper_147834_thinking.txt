To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Reinforcement Learning to Self Training for Pulmonary Nodule Segmentation in Chest X-rays" by Sejin Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was tested on a pulmonary nodule segmentation task in chest X-rays, suggesting that a dataset related to chest X-rays is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Data Collection and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **931 images with pixel labels (1007 pulmonary nodules)** and **2986 images without labels**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of images and the nature of the labels.

I will also check the **Acknowledgements and References sections** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, the dataset is described in detail in the methods section, and it appears that the authors did not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. Since the dataset was collected from the **Seoul Asan Medical Center**, I will note that as the source.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details about the dataset:

1. **Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset consists of 931 labeled images containing 1007 pulmonary nodules, along with an additional 2986 unlabeled images. The labels were created by consensus from three board-certified radiologists.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note the source as the **Seoul Asan Medical Center**.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details and the source of the dataset accurately.
