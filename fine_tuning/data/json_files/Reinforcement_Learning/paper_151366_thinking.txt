To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negative Preference Optimization: From Catastrophic Collapse to Effective Unlearning" by Ruiqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **TOFU dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. The **experiments section** (Section 5) is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. Here, I will find that the authors explicitly mention the **TOFU dataset** and describe its structure, which consists of 200 fictitious author profiles, each with 20 question-answer pairs.

I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **related work section**, the authors reference other datasets used in the context of unlearning methods, such as the **PKUSafe dataset** and the **Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)** dataset. However, I need to confirm if these datasets were actually used in the experiments or just referenced.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. For the **TOFU dataset**, the citation is:
> Pratyush Maini, Zhili Feng, Avi Schwarzschild, Zachary C Lipton, and J Zico Kolter. *TOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.06121, 2024.

For the **PKUSafe dataset**, the citation is:
> Jiaming Ji, Mickel Liu, Josef Dai, Xuehai Pan, Chi Zhang, Ce Bian, Boyuan Chen, Ruiyang Sun, Yizhou Wang, and Yaodong Yang. *Beavertails: Towards Improved Safety Alignment of LLM via a Human-Preference Dataset*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

For the **WMDP dataset**, the citation is:
> Nathaniel Li, Alexander Pan, Anjali Gopal, Summer Yue, Daniel Berrios, Alice Gatti, Justin D Li, Ann-Kathrin Dombrowski, Shashwat Goel, Long Phan, et al. *The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use with Unlearning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03218, 2024.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
