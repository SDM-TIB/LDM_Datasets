To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State-Space Constraints Improve the Generalization of the Differentiable Neural Computer in some Algorithmic Tasks" by Patrick Ofner and Roman Kern, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or tasks that involve datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental design and analyses section** (Section IV) closely, as this section typically details the datasets used for the experiments. Here, I will look for any specific names of datasets or tasks that are associated with datasets. The authors mention various algorithmic tasks such as sorting, copying, and differentiation, but I need to confirm if these tasks are based on specific datasets.

In the **task descriptions** provided in Table I, I will note the tasks and their descriptions to see if they reference any datasets. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for the sorting or copying tasks, I will highlight that.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation format as required.

For instance, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will look for the original papers that describe these datasets and extract their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
