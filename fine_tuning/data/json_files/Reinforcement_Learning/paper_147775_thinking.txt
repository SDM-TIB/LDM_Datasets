To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretation of Natural Language Rules in Conversational Machine Reading" by Marzieh Saeidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a corpus of **32k task instances** based on real-world rules and crowd-generated questions. This suggests that a dataset has been created, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (ShARC)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the ShARC dataset is built from **948 distinct snippets of rule text**, with a total of **32,436 utterances**. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and structure.

In **section 4.1**, the authors provide a breakdown of the dataset, including the number of utterances, trees, scenarios, and sources. This section confirms the dataset's composition and its relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShARC dataset. The authors mention that the dataset and its Codalab challenge can be found at a specific URL: 
> https://sharc-data.github.io.

However, I need to ensure that I provide a proper citation format. The citation for the ShARC dataset can be structured as follows:
> Saeidi, M., Bartolo, M., Lewis, P. S., Singh, S., Rockt√§schel, T., Sheldon, M., Bouchard, G., & Riedel, S. (2018). *Interpretation of Natural Language Rules in Conversational Machine Reading*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP 2018.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and adheres to the requirements for dataset documentation.
