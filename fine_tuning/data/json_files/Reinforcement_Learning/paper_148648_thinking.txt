To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variance-Reduced Off-Policy Memory-Efficient Policy Search" by Daoming Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to the introduction and experiments sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of off-policy policy search and mention the use of empirical studies to validate their proposed algorithms. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical studies. In this section, they mention that experiments were conducted on benchmark domains provided by OpenAI Gym, specifically:

1. **CartPoleContinuous-v0**: This is a continuous action space environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Hopper-v2**: This environment simulates a 2D robot that attempts to hop.
3. **HalfCheetah-v2**: This environment simulates a 2D cheetah robot that attempts to run.

The authors provide details about the state and action dimensions for each environment, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will reference the appropriate source:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets used in the paper:

1. **CartPoleContinuous-v0**
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Hopper-v2**
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

3. **HalfCheetah-v2**
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output.
