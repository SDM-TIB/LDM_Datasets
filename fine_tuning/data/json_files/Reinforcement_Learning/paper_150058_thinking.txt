To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MA2QL: A Minimalist Approach to Fully Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Kefan Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their method on several environments, specifically:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MPE)**: This is a well-known benchmark for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. The authors mention using three tasks: simple spread, line control, and circle control.

2. **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**: The authors also evaluate their method on robotic control tasks in the MuJoCo physics engine, specifically on tasks like HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d.

3. **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This is another benchmark mentioned in the paper, where the authors test their method on various maps with different levels of difficulty.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets or environments. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the references of the paper, and I will ensure to include them in the final output.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following citations:

- For **Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MPE)**:
  > Ryan Lowe, Yi Wu, Aviv Tamar, Jean Harb, Pieter Abbeel, and Igor Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

- For **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**:
  > Timothy P. Lillicrap, Jonathan J. Hunt, Alexander Pritzel, Nicolas Heess, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, David Silver, and Daan Wierstra. *Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2016.

- For **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The starcraft multi-agent challenge*. In International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
