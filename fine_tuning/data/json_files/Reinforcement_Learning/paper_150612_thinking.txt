To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining a Meta-Policy and Monte-Carlo Planning for Scalable Type-Based Reasoning in Partially Observable Environments" by Jonathon Schwartz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and the context of their research. This section may provide insights into the datasets used in previous studies or those that the authors have employed.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used, including any specific characteristics or configurations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any preprocessing steps taken. This section is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for specific datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments, such as:

1. **Driving Environment Dataset**: This dataset is used for the general-sum grid world navigation problem. I will look for the citation that describes its creation or usage.

2. **Pursuit-Evasion Dataset**: This dataset is used for the asymmetric zero-sum grid world problem. I will find the relevant citation that details its characteristics.

3. **Predator-Prey Dataset**: This dataset is used for the cooperative grid world problem. I will also locate the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing.
