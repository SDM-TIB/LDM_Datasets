To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifetime policy reuse and the importance of task capacity" by David M. Bossens and Adam J. Sobey, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup. This section often includes detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to the **27-task Cartpole domain** and the **18-task POcman domain**. These are likely to be the primary datasets used for the experiments. I will note any relevant details such as the number of tasks, task characteristics, and any specific configurations or parameters associated with these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on previous works or established benchmarks. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **27-task Cartpole domain**, I will look for the following citation:
- The original source or benchmark that defines the Cartpole tasks, which may be referenced in the methodology.

For the **18-task POcman domain**, I will similarly look for citations that describe the specific tasks and their configurations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their relevant details and sources.
