To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Landmark-based Self-localization Using Ranking-based Scene Descriptor" by Tanaka Kanji, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using the **public NCLT dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experiments)** in detail, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the author explicitly states that four different datasets were used: **“2012/1/22 (WI)”, “2012/3/31 (SP)”, “2012/8/4 (SU)”, and “2012/11/17 (AU)”**. Each of these datasets contains a specific number of images, which is also detailed in this section.

I will also look for any additional context or descriptions about the datasets, such as their purpose or how they were collected. The paper mentions that the data includes view image sequences along vehicle trajectories acquired using a front-facing camera, along with ground-truth GPS viewpoint information. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the NCLT dataset as follows:

- **NCLT Dataset**: 
  > N. Carlevaris-Bianco, A. K. Ushani, and R. M. Eustice. *University of Michigan North Campus Long-Term Vision and Lidar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 35, no. 9, pp. 1023–1035, 2016.

The other datasets mentioned (the specific dates) appear to be subsets or specific configurations of the NCLT dataset, so they do not have separate citations. However, I will note that they are part of the NCLT dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the NCLT dataset, and summarize the details of the four specific datasets used in the experiments.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information about the datasets while adhering to the importance of full citations.
