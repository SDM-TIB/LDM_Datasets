To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Sensing and Communication Optimization in Target-Mounted STARS-Assisted Vehicular Networks: A MADRL Approach" by Haocheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their simulations or evaluations. In this section, they may provide details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, they will likely provide full citations in this section.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the information about each dataset. If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will ensure to write the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will note that as well, indicating that the paper may rely on simulated data or previously established datasets without providing specific names.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in this research paper effectively.
