To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Nearly Optimal and Low-Switching Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning with General Function Approximation" by Heyang Zhao, Jiafan He, and Quanquan Gu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, and if datasets are used, they may be referenced here.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section typically discusses prior work and may reference datasets used in those studies, which could be relevant to the current research.

I will then check the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach. This section often includes details about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed algorithm. I will look for any explicit names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Following that, I will examine the **results** section, where the authors may discuss the performance of their algorithm on specific datasets. This could provide additional context about the datasets used and their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as found in the references section. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
