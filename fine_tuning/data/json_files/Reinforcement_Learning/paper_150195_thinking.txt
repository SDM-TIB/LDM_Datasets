To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaSnake: Policy Iteration on a Nondeterministic NP-hard Markov Decision Process" by Kevin Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the game of Snake, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the application of reinforcement learning to NP-hard problems but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then check the **experiments section** for any datasets used in the evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The experiments section mentions running the algorithm on a 10 Ã— 10 game board, but it does not specify any external datasets. Instead, it describes the game environment created for the study.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets explicitly, I will look at the **references section** to see if any cited works provide datasets relevant to the research. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and theoretical aspects rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created a custom environment for the Snake game, which is a simulation rather than a dataset derived from real-world data.

Since there are no datasets to extract, I will summarize my findings:

1. **No external datasets were mentioned or used in the experiments.**
2. The research focuses on a custom simulation environment for the Snake game rather than on datasets from previous works.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning to the game of Snake, it does not provide any datasets or references to datasets that can be cited. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile or format for this research paper.
