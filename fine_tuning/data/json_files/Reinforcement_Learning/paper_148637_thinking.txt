To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Scheduling for Stochastic Edge-Cloud Computing Environments using A3C learning and Residual Recurrent Neural Networks" by Shreshth Tuli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a **real-world dataset**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the simulation environment and state that they used the **Bitbrain dataset** for generating dynamic workloads. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed scheduling framework.

I will then check the **dataset description** provided in the paper. The authors explain that the Bitbrain dataset contains real traces of resource consumption metrics from business-critical workloads hosted on Bitbrain infrastructure. This dataset includes logs of over 1000 VMs, detailing CPU, RAM, network, and disk bandwidth characteristics.

Now, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the Bitbrain dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> BitBrain dataset. Available at: http://gwa.ewi.tudelft.nl/datasets/gwa-t-12-bitbrains.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Bitbrain Dataset**: This dataset includes real-world workload data from Bitbrain infrastructure, featuring resource consumption metrics for over 1000 VMs. It provides detailed logs of CPU, RAM, network, and disk bandwidth characteristics, which are essential for simulating dynamic workloads in edge-cloud environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
