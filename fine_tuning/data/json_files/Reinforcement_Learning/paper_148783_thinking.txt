To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Deep-Learning-Accelerated Topology Optimization for Additively Manufactured Materials" by Sirui Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a scalable deep-learning framework for topology optimization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **examples section** where the authors describe benchmark problems. In this section, they mention two specific examples that could potentially involve datasets:

1. **Benchmark bridge structure**: The authors describe a design problem involving a bridge structure with specific material properties and optimization goals. However, they do not provide a dataset reference here.

2. **Two materials heat conduction**: This example involves optimizing the layout of two materials with defined thermal conductivities. Again, while the problem is described, there is no explicit mention of a dataset.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. However, it appears that the focus is more on methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will examine the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the methodologies used. The references include various papers related to topology optimization, but they do not specifically mention datasets used in this study.

After reviewing the entire paper, it seems that while the authors discuss methodologies and examples, they do not provide explicit datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:
- No specific datasets were mentioned or cited in the paper "Scalable Deep-Learning-Accelerated Topology Optimization for Additively Manufactured Materials" by Sirui Bi et al. 

This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper to identify any potential datasets, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such.
