To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving RNA Secondary Structure Design using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Xiangru Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention a new benchmark for RNA sequence design, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly the subsections where the authors describe their experimental setup. This is where they are likely to detail the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experiments** section, the authors may provide additional context about the datasets, including how they were used in their experiments and any performance metrics associated with them. This section is crucial for confirming the datasets mentioned earlier and understanding their significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section for full citations. This is essential for providing proper attribution to the datasets used in the research. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used existing datasets related to RNA sequences or secondary structures, or they may have introduced a new dataset as part of their research. I will ensure to capture the following information for each dataset:

1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
