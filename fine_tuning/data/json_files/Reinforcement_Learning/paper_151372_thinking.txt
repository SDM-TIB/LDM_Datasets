To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computation Offloading for Multi-server Multi-access Edge Vehicular Networks: A DDQN-based Method" by Siyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section may explicitly mention datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors may provide further details about the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were used in the experiments. This section is crucial for confirming the datasets mentioned earlier and understanding their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to vehicular networks, computation offloading, or multi-access edge computing, as these are the main themes of the research. If the authors reference datasets from other studies, I will ensure to cite those original sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing.
