To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GenderBias-VL: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Vision Language Models via Counterfactual Probing" by Yisong Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **GenderBias-VL benchmark**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is being presented. The introduction further elaborates on this benchmark, stating that it comprises **34,581 visual question counterfactual pairs** covering **177 occupations**. This provides a foundational understanding of the dataset's scope.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the **GenderBias-VL benchmark** is described in detail in **section 3 (GenderBias-VL Benchmark)**. Here, the authors explain the construction of the dataset, including the generation of visual question counterfactual pairs and the identification of stereotyped occupation pairs.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **GenderBias-VL**: This benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate occupation-related gender bias in large vision-language models (LVLMs). It consists of **34,581 visual question counterfactual pairs** and covers **177 occupations**. The dataset is constructed using text-to-image diffusion models and includes various methodologies for generating counterfactuals.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GenderBias-VL dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper itself, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For **GenderBias-VL**, the citation is:
  > Yisong Xiao, Aishan Liu, QianJia Cheng, Zhenfei Yin, Siyuan Liang, Jiapeng Li, Jing Shao, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao. *GenderBias-VL: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Vision Language Models via Counterfactual Probing*. Preprint. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its citation for future reference.
