To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Best Possible Q-Learning" by Jiechuan Jiang and Zongqing Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various multi-agent cooperative tasks, including **MPE-based differential games**, **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**, **SMAC**, and **Google Research Football (GRF)**. Each of these environments can be considered a dataset in the context of reinforcement learning experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to access the original sources of the datasets.

1. **MPE-based Differential Games**: The citation for the original work that introduced this environment is:
   > Jiang, J., & Lu, Z. (2022). I2Q: A Fully Decentralized Q-Learning Algorithm. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

2. **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**: The citation for this environment is:
   > Peng, B., Rashid, T., Schroeder de Witt, C., Kamienny, P.-A., Torr, P., BÃ¶hmer, W., & Whiteson, S. (2021). Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Continuous Cooperative Control. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.06709.

3. **SMAC (StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Samvelyan, M., Rashid, T., de Witt, C. S., Farquhar, G., Nardelli, N., Rudner, T. G. J., Hung, C.-M., Torr, P. H. S., Foerster, J., & Whiteson, S. (2019). The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04043.

4. **Google Research Football (GRF)**: The citation for this environment is:
   > Kurach, K., Raichuk, A., Stanczyk, P., Zajkac, M., Bachem, O., Espeholt, L., Riquelme, C., Vincent, D., Michalski, M., Bousquet, O., et al. (2020). Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
