To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fast, Learning Slow: A General Continual Learning Method Based on Complementary Learning System" by Elahe Arani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to gather initial information about any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **experimental setup**:

1. **S-MNIST**: A sequential version of the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used for benchmarking continual learning methods.
2. **S-CIFAR-10**: A sequential version of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
3. **S-Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, used for image classification tasks.
4. **R-MNIST**: A rotated version of the MNIST dataset, where the digits are rotated at various angles.
5. **P-MNIST**: A permuted version of the MNIST dataset, where the pixels are randomly permuted.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**:

- **Permuted MNIST Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
