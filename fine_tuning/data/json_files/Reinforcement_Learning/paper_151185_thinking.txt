To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Counterfactuals With Necessary Backtracking" by Guang-Yuan Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MorphoMNIST**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, generated based on a causal graph involving stroke thickness and intensity. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset.

2. **3DIdentBOX**: This dataset consists of images created with Blender, depicting a teapot with seven attributes. The authors mention two specific datasets derived from this: **Weak-3DIdent** and **Strong-3DIdent**, which differ in the strength of causal relationships.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MorphoMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Pawlowski, N., Coelho de Castro, D., & Glocker, B. (2020). *Deep Structural Causal Models for Tractable Counterfactual Inference*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, 857–869.

- For **3DIdentBOX**, the citation is:
  > Bizeul, A., Daunhawer, I., Palumbo, E., Schölkopf, B., Marx, A., & Vogt, J. E. (2023). *3DIdentBox: A Toolbox for Identifiability Benchmarking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00001.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for the datasets, ready for review or further processing.
