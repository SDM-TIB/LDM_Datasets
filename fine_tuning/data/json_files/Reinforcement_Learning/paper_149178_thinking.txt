To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Objective discovery of dominant dynamical processes with intelligible machine learning" by Bryan E. Kaiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to various example problems, which may imply the use of specific datasets. However, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will carefully review the **methods** section, particularly the subsections that describe the examples. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the experiments. For instance, the authors mention using data from ocean dynamics, tumor angiogenesis, and turbulent boundary layers. I will look for specific dataset names or references to prior works that provide datasets.

In the **examples** section, the authors provide detailed case studies. I will focus on each example to identify any datasets used. For instance, they reference the "global ocean barotropic vorticity" problem, which is based on data from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention using data from the Johns Hopkins University turbulence database for the turbulent boundary layer example. I will look for the specific citation for this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper documentation.

1. **ECCO Dataset**: The citation for the ECCO dataset is:
   > Forget, G., Campin, J.-M., Heimbach, P., Hill, C. N., Ponte, R. M., and Wunsch, C. (2015). *ECCO version 4: An integrated framework for non-linear inverse modeling and global ocean state estimation*.

2. **Johns Hopkins University Turbulence Database**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zaki, T. A. (2013). *From streaks to spots and on to turbulence: exploring the dynamics of boundary layer transition*. Flow, turbulence and combustion, 91(3):451â€“473.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are accurately documented with their respective citations.
