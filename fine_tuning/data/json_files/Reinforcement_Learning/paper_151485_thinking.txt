To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symmetric Reinforcement Learning Loss for Robust Learning on Diverse Tasks and Model Scales" by Ju-Seung Byun and Andrew Perrault, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), indicating that they likely used datasets related to these methods. However, I need to locate the exact datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention conducting experiments on discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D). This is a strong indication that specific datasets are utilized for these tasks.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **Atari Games**: The authors refer to a set of 22 Atari games used for evaluating their methods. These games are well-known benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

2. **MuJoCo Benchmark**: This is a physics engine used for continuous control tasks, and it serves as a dataset for evaluating the performance of their proposed methods.

3. **Box2D**: Another environment for continuous action tasks, which is also mentioned as part of their experimental setup.

In the **RLHF tasks**, they mention using the **IMDB dataset** for positive sentiment analysis and the **TL;DR dataset** for summarization tasks. These datasets are crucial for evaluating the performance of their methods in the context of large language models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Atari Games**, the citation is:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
