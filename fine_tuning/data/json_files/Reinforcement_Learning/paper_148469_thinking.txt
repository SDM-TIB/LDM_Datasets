To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Autonomous Driving by Learning End-to-End Visual Attention" by Luca Cultrera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA driving simulator**, which suggests that a dataset related to this simulator may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **3.8 Dataset** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention that they use data from the **CARLA simulator**. They provide details about the dataset, including the conditions under which the data was collected and the types of measurements included.

The paper states that the dataset consists of images captured in various weather conditions and includes measurements for steering, accelerator, brake, and high-level commands. This confirms that the CARLA dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., & LÃ³pez, A. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating autonomous driving agents in a simulated urban environment. It includes images captured under various weather conditions and provides measurements for steering, accelerator, brake, and high-level commands.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the full citation as required.
