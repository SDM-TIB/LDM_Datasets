To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deconstructing Deep Active Inference" by Th√©o Champion et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. This can provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **dSprites dataset**, I would note the following citation:
- Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dSprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/

If the authors mention other datasets, such as the **Animal-AI environment**, I would similarly look for its citation:
- Schneider, T., Belousov, B., Abdulsamad, H., & Peters, J. (2022). *Active inference for robotic manipulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:220610313.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations before concluding the extraction process.
