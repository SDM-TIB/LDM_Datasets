To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Final Iteration Convergence Bound of Q-Learning: Switching System Approach" by Donghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. If the paper includes a section specifically discussing datasets, it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets, particularly in the context of experiments or results. If the author mentions any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the references.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider whether the authors refer to any existing datasets from other works. In such cases, I will look up those references to obtain the necessary citation information.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
