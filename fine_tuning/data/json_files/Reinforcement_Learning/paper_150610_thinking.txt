To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progression Cognition Reinforcement Learning with Prioritized Experience for Multi-Vehicle Pursuit" by Xinhang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and purpose.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of simulation environments or real-world datasets used for testing the proposed method. The authors may describe the urban traffic scenarios or simulations they used, which could be considered datasets in the context of this research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific traffic simulation dataset, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If they used a well-known dataset, I will ensure to provide the citation as it appears in the original source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, in a clear and organized manner. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced by others interested in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
