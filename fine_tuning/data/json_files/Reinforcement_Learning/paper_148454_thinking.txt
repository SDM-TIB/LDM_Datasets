To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Good Counterfactuals and Where to Find Them: A Case-Based Technique for Generating Counterfactuals for Explainable AI (XAI)" by Mark T. Keane and Barry Smyth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of counterfactual explanations and hints at the analysis of various datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment 1: Plotting Counterfactual Potential)**, where the authors mention analyzing **20 classic datasets from the UCI repository**. This section is crucial as it explicitly states the datasets used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors provide a table (Table 2) that lists the datasets analyzed, including their names and some statistics about them. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Abalone**
2. **Auto MPG**
3. **BAC (Blood Alcohol Content)**
4. **Bupa liver**
5. **Credit**
6. **Cleveland heart**
7. **Ecoli**
8. **Glass**
9. **German credit**
10. **Horse colic**
11. **Indian liver**
12. **Ionosphere**
13. **Iris**
14. **Sonar**
15. **Soybean (large)**
16. **Thyroid**
17. **Votes**
18. **Wine-Italian**
19. **Wisconsin breast**
20. **Yeast**

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The UCI Machine Learning Repository is referenced, which is a common source for many datasets in machine learning research.

The citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository is:
> Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCI repository as it serves as the source for the datasets mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation.
