To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACE: Cooperative Multi-agent Q-learning with Bidirectional Action-Dependency" by Chuming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on two MARL benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They specifically mention using two benchmark environments: **Google Research Football (GRF)** and **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments to confirm they are indeed datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the tasks they evaluated ACE on. They mention:

1. **Google Research Football (GRF)**: This is described as a challenging environment with a large action space and sparse rewards, where agents coordinate to score goals. The specific scenarios mentioned are **academy_3_vs_1_with_keeper** and **academy_counterattack_hard**.

2. **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This benchmark consists of various maps classified as Easy, Hard, and Super Hard. The authors focus on four super hard maps: **corridor**, **MMM2**, **6h_vs_8z**, and **3s5z_vs_3s6z**, and four hard maps: **5m_vs_6m**, **2c_vs_64zg**, **8m_vs_9m**, and **3s_vs_5z**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google Research Football**, the citation is:
  > Kuba, J. G.; Chen, R.; Wen, M.; Wen, Y.; Sun, F.; Wang, J.; and Yang, Y. (2020). *Google research football: A novel reinforcement learning environment*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34, pages 4501â€“4510.

- For **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge**, the citation is:
  > Samvelyan, M.; Rashid, T.; De Witt, C. S.; Farquhar, G.; Nardelli, N.; Rudner, T. G.; Hung, C.-M.; Torr, P. H.; Foerster, J.; and Whiteson, S. (2019). *The starcraft multi-agent challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04043.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
