To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "CeFlow: A Robust and Efficient Counterfactual Explanation Framework for Tabular Data using Normalizing Flows" by Tri Dung Duong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation: **Law**, **Compas**, and **Adult**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, as they will help in understanding their characteristics and relevance to the study.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

1. **Law Dataset**: The authors describe it as providing information about students, including their entrance exam scores (LSAT), GPA, and first-year average grade (FYA). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wightman, L.F. (1998). *LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study*. LSAC Research Report Series.

2. **Compas Dataset**: This dataset contains information about 6,167 prisoners, including features such as gender, race, and attributes related to prior convictions and age. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Larson, J., Mattu, S., Kirchner, L., & Angwin, J. (2016). *How We Analyzed the Compas Recidivism Algorithm*. ProPublica.

3. **Adult Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset consisting of both continuous and categorical features of consumers applying for loans at a financial institution. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and ensure that the datasets are correctly attributed in any future work.
