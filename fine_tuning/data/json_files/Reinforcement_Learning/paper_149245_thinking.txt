To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems with Continuous Action Spaces" by Ziyad Sheebaelhamd et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses enhancing the MADDPG framework, but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific mentions in the introduction and methods sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various applications of deep reinforcement learning but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **methods section**, particularly focusing on the **experiments** subsection, where datasets are likely to be detailed.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using a **multi-agent particle environment** for their experiments. This environment is crucial for their evaluation, but I need to confirm if it is a publicly available dataset or a custom-built environment.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the multi-agent particle environment. The authors reference previous works, specifically Lowe et al. (2017a) and Mordatch & Abbeel (2018), which describe the multi-agent particle environment. 

I will now extract the full citations for these references:

1. For the **multi-agent particle environment**, the citation is:
   > Lowe, R., Wu, Y., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, P., and Mordatch, I. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2017a.

2. Another relevant reference is:
   > Mordatch, I. and Abbeel, P. *Emergence of grounded compositional language in multi-agent populations*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 32, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **multi-agent particle environment**, and I have provided the necessary citations for it. This will ensure that the information is complete and properly attributed.
