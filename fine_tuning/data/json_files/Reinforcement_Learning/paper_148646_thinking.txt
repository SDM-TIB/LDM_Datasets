To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COUNTERGAN: GENERATING REALISTIC COUNTERFACTUALS WITH RESIDUAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETS" by Daniel Nemirovsky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions evaluations on "two popular datasets," which indicates that specific datasets are used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors conducted experiments using three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, which are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in generating counterfactuals. 

2. **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset contains 8 features related to diabetes prediction, with a total of 768 samples. It is used to demonstrate the versatility of the CounteRGAN method on tabular data.

3. **COMPAS Recidivism Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,214 arrests and is used to evaluate the method's effectiveness in improving model interpretability and fairness in the context of criminal justice.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jack W Smith, J E Everhart, W C Dickson, W C Knowler, and R S Johannes. *Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus*. Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Application in Medical Care, page 261, November 1988.

- For the **COMPAS Recidivism Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProPublica. *Compas*, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
