To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis and Improvement of Adversarial Training in DQN Agents With Adversarially-Guided Exploration" by Vahid Behzadan and William Hsu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses adversarial training and exploration mechanisms but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe the environment and policies used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **CartPole environment** from OpenAI Gym, which is a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. This indicates that the dataset or environment used for training the DQN agents is the CartPole environment.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CartPole environment. The authors reference OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (2016).

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or benchmarks, I will conclude that the primary dataset/environment used in this research is the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset/environment used in the experiments.
