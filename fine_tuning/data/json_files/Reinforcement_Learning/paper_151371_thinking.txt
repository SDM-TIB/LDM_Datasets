To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Counterfactual Explanations Using Cardinality Constraints" by RubÃ©n Ruiz-Torrubiano, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusions sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the concept of counterfactual explanations but does not mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology section** where the author describes the use of the CERTIFAI framework and mentions the **drug200 dataset** obtained from Kaggle. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section**, where the author mentions the drug200 dataset again, confirming its use in generating counterfactuals. Additionally, the author refers to another dataset, the **Car Evaluation dataset**, which was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository. This dataset is also used for further validation of the results.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the **drug200 dataset**, since it is obtained from Kaggle, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset but may not have a formal citation. However, I will reference Kaggle as the source.

For the **Car Evaluation dataset**, I will refer to the UCI Machine Learning repository, which provides a formal citation for datasets hosted there. The citation for this dataset is:
> Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation).

After identifying the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **drug200 dataset**: A dataset obtained from Kaggle, used for generating counterfactuals.
2. **Car Evaluation dataset**: A dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, used for additional experiments.

Now, I will prepare to format this information appropriately for downstream processing or review.
