To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stratification of uncertainties recalibrated by isotonic regression and its impact on calibration error statistics" by Pascal Pernot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and application sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the introduction often contains more detailed information about the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of post hoc recalibration of prediction uncertainties and mentions isotonic regression. However, I need to look for specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **application section (Section III)**, where the author explicitly mentions the **QM9 validation dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 13,885 predicted atomization energies and uncertainties, which were recalibrated using isotonic regression. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the data.

I will also check the **methods section** for any additional datasets or details about how the QM9 dataset was processed or utilized in the experiments. However, it appears that the QM9 dataset is the primary focus for the analysis presented in this paper.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Busk, P. B. JÃ¸rgensen, A. Bhowmik, M. N. Schmidt, O. Winther, and T. Vegge. *Calibrated uncertainty for molecular property prediction using ensembles of message passing neural networks*. Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol., 3:015012, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the QM9 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the QM9 validation dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
