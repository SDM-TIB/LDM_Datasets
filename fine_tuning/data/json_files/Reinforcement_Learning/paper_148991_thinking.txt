To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auctioning Annuities" by Gaurab Aryal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses using "rich data from Chile," which suggests that there is a specific dataset related to the annuity market in Chile.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (Section 3)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their analysis. In this section, the authors mention that they have administrative data from SCOMP on all annuities purchased in Chile from January 2007 to December 2017. This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and covers a specific time frame.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the administrative data from SCOMP, which is central to their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from administrative data, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset would. However, I will note the source as follows:

- **SCOMP Dataset**: The dataset is derived from the administrative records of the Chilean annuity market, specifically from the SCOMP platform, which tracks all annuities purchased in Chile from January 2007 to December 2017.

Since this dataset is not formally published in a separate paper, I will document it as an administrative dataset sourced from a government platform.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or sources. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
