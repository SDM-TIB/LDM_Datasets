To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias-Reduced Hindsight Experience Replay with Virtual Goal Prioritization" by B. Manela and A. Biess, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of **three challenging environments for complex manipulation tasks with sparse feedback**, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the environments used to validate their algorithms. They specifically mention three environments:

1. **Hand Environment**: This environment involves a hand that needs to pick up a ball and throw it at a target. The paper describes the setup and the goal of the task.

2. **Hand-Wall Environment**: Similar to the Hand environment, but with a wall that the agent must throw the ball over to reach the target.

3. **Robot Environment**: In this task, a manipulator must pick up a ball and throw it at a target, controlling the end-effector via joint velocities.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about these environments, including their specifications, observations, actions, and reward functions, which may provide further context for the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are likely original contributions of the authors, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note that these environments were created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

For the environments, I will summarize them as follows:

- **Hand Environment**: A custom environment designed for the task of picking up and throwing a ball.
- **Hand-Wall Environment**: A variation of the Hand environment with an added wall obstacle.
- **Robot Environment**: A custom robotic manipulation environment for throwing a ball.

Since these environments are original and created by the authors, I will cite them as follows:

- For the **Hand Environment**:
  > Manela, B., & Biess, A. (2023). *Bias-Reduced Hindsight Experience Replay with Virtual Goal Prioritization*. Preprint.

- For the **Hand-Wall Environment**:
  > Manela, B., & Biess, A. (2023). *Bias-Reduced Hindsight Experience Replay with Virtual Goal Prioritization*. Preprint.

- For the **Robot Environment**:
  > Manela, B., & Biess, A. (2023). *Bias-Reduced Hindsight Experience Replay with Virtual Goal Prioritization*. Preprint.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citations for each environment as noted above. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
