To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decorrelated Double Q-learning" by Gang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on a suite of **MuJoCo continuous control tasks**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the author discusses the performance of the proposed method. Here, I will look for any specific names of datasets or environments that were utilized during the experiments. The paper mentions that the experiments were conducted using the **OpenAI Gym environment** and specifically lists various tasks such as **Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper, InvertedDoublePendulum, Reacher, and Walker2d**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. Since the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the MuJoCo tasks, I will reference the original source of the MuJoCo environments and the OpenAI Gym:

1. **MuJoCo**: The citation for MuJoCo is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vitchyr Pong, Justin Johnson, and others. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
