To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Safe Occupancy Strategies in Educational Spaces During an Epidemic" by Elizabeth Akinyi Ondula and Bhaskar Krishnamachari, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets or tools used in the study. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors might describe the datasets used for their experiments or simulations. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors introduce **SafeCampus**, a tool that simulates infection spread and explores various reinforcement learning algorithms. I will check if they provide any details about the data used to inform this simulation, such as parameters or initial conditions derived from real-world datasets.

I will also examine the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that the authors reference. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset mentioned.

If the paper does not explicitly list datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about the data sources used in the research.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations according to academic standards, ensuring that they are complete and accurate.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ready for further processing or review.
