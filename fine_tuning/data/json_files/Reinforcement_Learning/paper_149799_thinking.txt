To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Whatâ€™s the Harm? Sharp Bounds on the Fraction Negatively Affected by Treatment" by Nathan Kallus, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and empirical investigation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or case studies.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets that were utilized in the experiments or analyses. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the simulations and case studies. This section typically includes information about the data collection process, the characteristics of the datasets, and how they were used in the analysis.

In the **empirical investigation section**, I will focus on the case study involving data from French reemployment assistance programs. Here, the author may provide specific details about the datasets, including their sources, sample sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I anticipate finding at least two datasets:

1. **French Reemployment Assistance Programs Dataset**: This dataset is likely used in the case study to analyze the impact of different counseling programs on reemployment outcomes. I will need to find the full citation for the original source of this dataset.

2. **Simulation Study Dataset**: The paper may describe a synthetic dataset generated for the simulation studies. I will look for any references to the methodology used to create this dataset and any relevant citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations to ensure proper documentation and facilitate further research.
