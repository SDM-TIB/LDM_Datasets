To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Channel Assignment and Power Allocation in Platoon-Based C-V2X Systems" by Hung V. Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on resource allocation in C-V2X systems, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. The introduction discusses the challenges of C-V2X systems and mentions existing research but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to identify any datasets used for simulations or experiments. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation setup and parameters, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they refer to simulation parameters and models based on existing literature.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **references section** for any studies that may have used datasets relevant to the research. The references include various papers on vehicular networking and resource allocation, but again, they do not specify datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors conducted simulations based on theoretical models rather than using specific datasets. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that while the paper discusses simulation results and methodologies, it does not reference any specific datasets. I will also ensure to document this lack of datasets in my final output.
