To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Individual Decision-Making Style: Exploring Behavioral Stylometry in Chess" by Reid McIlroy-Young et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the datasets used in the experiments, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **Lichess Dataset**: This dataset consists of chess games downloaded from Lichess, a popular open-source chess platform. The authors specify that they collected rated Blitz games played between January 2013 and December 2020, filtering for players with specific criteria.

2. **High-ranking Players Dataset**: This dataset includes games from the top 1,500 players on Lichess and Chess.com, filtered for games with fewer than 10 moves and players with fewer than 950 games.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Lichess dataset is publicly available and released under a Creative Commons CC0 license, which is important to note. However, the high-ranking players dataset does not have a specific citation since it is derived from publicly available player data.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **Lichess Dataset**, I will note:
  > Lichess. *Lichess Chess Games Database*. Available at: https://lichess.org

- For the **High-ranking Players Dataset**, since it is derived from Lichess and Chess.com, I will mention:
  > Chess.com. *Chess.com Player Database*. Available at: https://www.chess.com

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
