To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Diversity Control in Symbolic Regression via a Fast Hash-based Tree Similarity Measure" by Bogdan Burlacu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may reference benchmark problems or datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach and may mention specific datasets used for testing their algorithms. In this paper, they mention testing their method on a collection of benchmark problems for symbolic regression, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors detail the specific benchmark problems they used to validate their approach. They list several benchmark problems, including:

1. **Poly-10 benchmark problem**: A well-known dataset used in symbolic regression.
2. **Vladislavleva benchmark problems**: A collection of datasets for evaluating symbolic regression methods.
3. **Pagie-1 benchmark problem**: Another dataset commonly used in this field.
4. **Breiman-1 benchmark problem**: A dataset from the classification and regression trees literature.
5. **Friedman benchmark problems**: A set of datasets used for testing regression algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described.

For example, I will look for citations related to:

- **Poly-10 benchmark problem**: This is often associated with the work of Poli et al. (2003).
- **Vladislavleva benchmark problems**: Typically cited from Vladislavleva et al. (2009).
- **Pagie-1 benchmark problem**: Cited from Pagie and Hogeweg (1997).
- **Breiman-1 benchmark problem**: Cited from Breiman et al. (1984).
- **Friedman benchmark problems**: Cited from Friedman (1991).

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **Poly-10 benchmark problem**:
  > R. Poli, “A simple but theoretically-motivated method to control bloat in genetic programming,” in Genetic Programming, C. Ryan et al., Eds. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2003, pp. 204–217.

- For **Vladislavleva benchmark problems**:
  > E. J. Vladislavleva, G. F. Smits, and D. den Hertog, “Order of nonlinearity as a complexity measure for models generated by symbolic regression via pareto genetic programming,” IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 333–349, April 2009.

- For **Pagie-1 benchmark problem**:
  > L. Pagie and P. Hogeweg, “Evolutionary consequences of coevolving targets,” Evolutionary Computation, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 401–418, 1997.

- For **Breiman-1 benchmark problem**:
  > L. Breiman, J. Friedman, C. Stone, and R. Olshen, *Classification and Regression Trees*. Taylor & Francis, 1984.

- For **Friedman benchmark problems**:
  > J. H. Friedman, “Multivariate adaptive regression splines,” Ann. Statist., vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 1–67, 1991.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly defined and includes the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
