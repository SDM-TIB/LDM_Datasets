To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orchestrated Value Mapping for Reinforcement Learning" by Mehdi Fatemi and Arash Tavakoli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their proposed algorithm on the **Atari 2600 suite**, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Atari 2600 suite is referenced in the context of the experiments, and I will look for the original source or relevant papers that describe this dataset.

The citation for the Atari 2600 suite is:
> Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **Atari 2600 suite**.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
