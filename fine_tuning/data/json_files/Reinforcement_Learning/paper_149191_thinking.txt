To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disaggregated Interventions to Reduce Inequality" by Lucius E.J. Bynum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the development of an "impact remediation framework" and discusses interventions related to disparities, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the analysis.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In particular, I will focus on any sections that describe the data collection process or the datasets used for analysis. For instance, in section 5 (Case Study: NYC Public Schools), the authors mention collecting data from "490 public schools in NYC counties for the 2017-2018 school year from publicly available National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data releases." This indicates that these two sources are key datasets used in their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the NCES and CRDC as sources of data, and I will need to ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)**:
   > National Center for Education Statistics. *Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups 2018*. NCES 2019-038. Available at: https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2019038

2. **Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)**:
   > U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. *Civil Rights Data Collection*. Available at: https://ocrdata.ed.gov/

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that all relevant information is captured for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
