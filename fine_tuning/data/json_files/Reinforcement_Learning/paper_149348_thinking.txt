To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gene regulatory network inference from single-cell data using a self-consistent proteomic field" by Ulysse Herbach, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to both simulated and real single-cell RNA-Seq data, indicating that there are datasets involved. The introduction further elaborates on the types of data used, specifically mentioning single-cell RNA-Seq data.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on any sections that might be labeled as **Datasets**, **Materials and Methods**, or **Results**. In this paper, the relevant information about datasets is likely to be found in the **Results** section, where the authors describe their experiments and the data they analyzed.

Upon reviewing the **Results** section, I will identify the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to a real dataset from a differentiation experiment on mouse embryonic stem cells, which consists of 9 time points and a varying number of sampled cells. The authors also mention that they analyze a subset of 41 preselected genes from this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the study. The paper cites the original source of the single-cell RNA-Seq dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Semrau, S., Goldmann, J. E., Soumillon, M., Mikkelsen, T. S., Jaenisch, R., & van Oudenarden, A. (2017). Dynamics of lineage commitment revealed by single-cell transcriptomics of differentiating embryonic stem cells. *Nature Communications*, 8(1), 1-14.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the findings in the paper. This will include details about the type of data (e.g., single-cell RNA-Seq), the number of genes analyzed, and the experimental conditions under which the data were collected.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant information is included and accurately represented.
