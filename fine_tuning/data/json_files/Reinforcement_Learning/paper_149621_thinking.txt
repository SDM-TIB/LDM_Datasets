To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval Augmented Reinforcement Learning" by Anirudh Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a dataset of past experiences for training the RL agent, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any dedicated sections that describe datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from various environments, including Atari games, Gridroboman, BabyAI, and CausalWorld. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide insights into the environments used for testing their methods. They mention:

1. **Atari Games**: The paper references the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) as a source of multiple datasets for reinforcement learning experiments. The specific games used include "Frostbite," "Breakout," "Ms. Pacman," and others.

2. **Gridroboman**: This is a custom environment created for the experiments, which includes 30 tasks related to robotic manipulation.

3. **BabyAI**: This environment is mentioned as a platform for studying grounded language learning, with 40 tasks available.

4. **CausalWorld**: This is another benchmark used in the experiments, focusing on continuous control tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites foundational works and datasets that are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments. For example, the Atari Learning Environment is often referenced in conjunction with the original paper by Bellemare et al. (2013).

Now, I will compile the datasets and their citations:

- **Atari Learning Environment**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

- **Gridroboman**:
  > This is a custom environment created by the authors, so it may not have a formal citation but should be noted as a dataset used in their experiments.

- **BabyAI**:
  > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Bahdanau, D., Lahlou, S., Willems, L., Saharia, C., Nguyen, T. H., & Bengio, Y. (2018). BabyAI: A platform to study the sample efficiency of grounded language learning. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- **CausalWorld**:
  > Ahmed, O., Träuble, F., Goyal, A., Neitz, A., Bengio, Y., Schölkopf, B., Wüthrich, M., & Bauer, S. (2020). CausalWorld: A robotic manipulation benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.04296*.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
