To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach towards Pendulum Swing-up Problem based on TF-Agents" by Yifei Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning to solve the pendulum swing-up problem, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Solution)**, particularly subsection II-A (Environment), where the authors describe the pendulum environment. They reference the "Pendulum-v0" environment from OpenAI Gym, which is a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks. This indicates that the authors are using a well-known dataset or environment for their experiments.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citation for the "Pendulum-v0" environment. The reference provided is:
> O. Gym, “Environment introduction pendulum-v0,” https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/, 2018, accessed: 2019-11-15.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or environments, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the "Pendulum-v0" environment.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. The only dataset I will include is:

1. **Pendulum-v0**: This is the environment used for training the reinforcement learning agent, which is a classic problem in control literature.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for "Pendulum-v0" with the full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
