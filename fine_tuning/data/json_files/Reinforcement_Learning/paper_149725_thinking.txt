To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence Estimation Transformer for Long-term Renewable Energy Forecasting in Reinforcement Learning-based Power Grid Dispatching" by Xinhang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **SG-126 power grid simulator**, which suggests that this simulator may be a dataset or a source of data for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section IV (Simulation and Results)**. Here, the authors discuss the **SG-126 power grid simulator** in detail, indicating that it is used for their experiments. However, I need to confirm if there are any other datasets mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the **maximum active power output of 18 renewable energy units** over **106820 days**, which is provided by the **China Electric Power Research Institute**. This is a clear indication of another dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **SG-126 power grid simulator**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is a well-known simulator used in power system studies. I will note that it is widely referenced in the literature.

2. For the dataset concerning the **maximum active power output of renewable energy units**, the citation is:
   > China Electric Power Research Institute. *Dataset on maximum active power output of renewable energy units*. [Online]. Available: [link to dataset if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
