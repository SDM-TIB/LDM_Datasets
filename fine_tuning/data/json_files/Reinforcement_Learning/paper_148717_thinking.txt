To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy and Service-priority aware Trajectory Design for UAV-BSs using Double Q-Learning" by Sayed Amir Hoseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the simulation setup in **Section IV (Performance Evaluation)**. Here, they mention that they simulated scenarios with six nodes randomly distributed on a grid service area. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name but rather describe the simulation parameters and the environment setup.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or specific dataset names, I will need to note that the data used for the simulations is generated based on the described parameters rather than sourced from an existing dataset.

After identifying the lack of specific datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may have provided datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. However, the references primarily discuss related works and do not indicate any datasets used in this study.

In conclusion, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **Simulated Data**: The paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets. Instead, it describes a simulation environment with parameters for six nodes on a grid, which is generated for the purpose of the study.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will note that the authors created their own simulation data based on the described parameters and methodologies.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the absence of specific datasets while acknowledging the simulation data used in the study.
