To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Generative Symbolic Regression with Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search" by Pierre-Alexandre Kamienny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the **SRBench benchmark**. This indicates that SRBench is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss evaluating their method on various datasets, specifically mentioning **synthetic datasets** and the **SRBench benchmark**. 

I will then check the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **SRBench**: The citation for the SRBench benchmark is:
   > La Cava, W., Orzechowski, P., Burlacu, B., de Franca, F. O., Virgolin, M., Jin, Y., Kommenda, M., and Moore, J. H. *Contemporary symbolic regression methods and their relative performance*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.14351, 2021.

2. **Synthetic datasets**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the synthetic datasets generated, it references the method used for generating these datasets:
   > Lample, G. and Charton, F. *Deep learning for symbolic mathematics*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.01412, 2019.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **SRBench**: A benchmark for symbolic regression that includes various datasets for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms.
- **Synthetic datasets**: Generated using a method based on the work of Lample and Charton, which involves creating expressions and corresponding data points.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
