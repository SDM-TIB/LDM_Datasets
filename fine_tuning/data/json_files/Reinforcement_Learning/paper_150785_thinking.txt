To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Yuya Sasaki, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Study)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and labels.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author mentions **twelve graphs** commonly used in GNN tasks, which are summarized in **Table 2**. The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 features, and 304 labels.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 features, and 530 labels.
3. **Amz-P**: A product graph with 7,650 nodes, 238,162 features, and 36,101 labels.
4. **Amz-C**: Another product graph with 13,752 nodes, 491,722 features, and 217,073 labels.
5. **Co-CS**: A collaboration graph with 18,333 nodes, 163,788 features, and 30,019 labels.
6. **PubMed**: A medical citation graph with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 features, and 2,498,498 labels.
7. **Cornell**: A social network graph with 2,277 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.
8. **Wisconsin**: Another social network graph with 2,301 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.
9. **Chameleon**: A social network graph with 2,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 10 labels.
10. **Squirrel**: A social network graph with 5,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 15 labels.
11. **Actor**: A social network graph with 7,600 nodes, 36,101 features, and 3 labels.
12. **Penn94**: A social network graph with 5,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of graph neural networks. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized in the literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets along with their characteristics. Since specific citations are not provided, I will mention that these datasets are standard in the field.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 features, and 304 labels.
2. **CiteSeer**: A citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 features, and 530 labels.
3. **Amz-P**: A product graph with 7,650 nodes, 238,162 features, and 36,101 labels.
4. **Amz-C**: A product graph with 13,752 nodes, 491,722 features, and 217,073 labels.
5. **Co-CS**: A collaboration graph with 18,333 nodes, 163,788 features, and 30,019 labels.
6. **PubMed**: A medical citation graph with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 features, and 2,498,498 labels.
7. **Cornell**: A social network graph with 2,277 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.
8. **Wisconsin**: A social network graph with 2,301 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.
9. **Chameleon**: A social network graph with 2,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 10 labels.
10. **Squirrel**: A social network graph with 5,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 15 labels.
11. **Actor**: A social network graph with 7,600 nodes, 36,101 features, and 3 labels.
12. **Penn94**: A social network graph with 5,000 nodes, 36,101 features, and 5 labels.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper.
