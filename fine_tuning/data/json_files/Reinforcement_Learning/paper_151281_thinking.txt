To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the Robustness of Time-series Forecasting Models with CounterfacTS" by Håkon Hanisch Kjærnli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a tool called CounterfacTS, which is used for probing the robustness of forecasting models with counterfactuals. It suggests that various datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section II (CounterfacTS)**, particularly **subsection II-B (Data and Models)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the UCI Learning Repository and is commonly used for time-series forecasting tasks.
2. **Traffic Dataset**: Another dataset from the UCI Learning Repository, also utilized for time-series forecasting.
3. **M4 Monthly Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a large collection of time series used for forecasting competitions.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Electricity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. A. Alexandrov, K. Benidis, M. Bohlke-Schneider, V. Flunkert, J. Gasthaus, T. Januschowski, D. C. Maddix, S. Rangapuram, D. Salinas, J. Schulz, L. Stella, A. C. Türkmen, and Y. Wang. *GluonTS: Probabilistic and Neural Time Series Modeling in Python*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(116):1–6, 2020.

- For the **Traffic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Traffic Volume Forecasting*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Traffic+Volume+Forecasting.

- For the **M4 Monthly Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Makridakis, E. Spiliotis, and V. Assimakopoulos. *The M4 Competition: 100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods*. International Journal of Forecasting, 36(1):54–74, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
