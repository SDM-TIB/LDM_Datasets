To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Position Bias Estimation with Item Embedding for Sparse Dataset" by Shion Ishikawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "public dataset" and an "internal carousel advertisement click dataset," which suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Open Bandit Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large public dataset containing 1,374,327 instances with 88 features and 80 items. The authors reference a specific paper for this dataset, which is crucial for the citation.

2. **Rakuten Ichiba Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Rakuten's e-commerce platform and consists of 494,329 instances with 156 features. The authors provide context about how this dataset was collected, which is helpful for understanding its relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Open Bandit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuta Saito, Aihara Shunsuke, Matsutani Megumi, and Narita Yusuke. 2020. *Open Bandit Dataset and Pipeline: Towards Realistic and Reproducible Off-Policy Evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.07146 (2020).

- For the **Rakuten Ichiba Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but since it is an internal dataset from Rakuten, it may not have a formal citation. However, I can note that it is derived from Rakuten's e-commerce platform.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Open Bandit Dataset**: A large public dataset with 1,374,327 instances and 88 features, referenced in the paper by Saito et al. (2020).
2. **Rakuten Ichiba Dataset**: An internal dataset from Rakuten containing 494,329 instances and 156 features, used for carousel advertisement click data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations.
