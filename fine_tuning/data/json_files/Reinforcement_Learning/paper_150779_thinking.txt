To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Visual Tracking and Reaching with Deep Reinforcement Learning on a UR10e Robotic Arm" by Colin Bellinger and Laurence Lamarche-Cliche, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets or environments that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention two specific environments for their experiments: the **reacher environment** and the **tracker environment**. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they describe the setup and the conditions under which the experiments were conducted, including the use of a UR10e robotic arm and a camera for visual input.

Since no external datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly or provide context for the environments used. However, it appears that the references primarily cite related works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any named datasets or external references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract in the traditional sense. Instead, the authors have created their own experimental environments for the purpose of their research.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the environments used for training the reinforcement learning agents, it does not reference any publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were identified in the paper.
