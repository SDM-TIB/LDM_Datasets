To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Based Reinforcement Learning for Audio-Visual Gaze Control in Human-Robot Interaction" by Stéphane Lathuilière et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets utilized for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of human-robot interaction and mention that their approach is evaluated using a publicly available dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. They refer to the **AVDIAR dataset**, which is described as being recorded with multiple microphones and a high-resolution camera, suitable for their gaze control experiments. 

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the AVDIAR dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and can usually be found in the references or bibliography of the paper.

The citation for the AVDIAR dataset is:
> Gebru, I., Ba, S., Li, X., & Horaud, R. (2017). Audio-visual speaker diarization based on spatiotemporal bayesian fusion. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 39(2), 1-1.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **AVDIAR Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the gaze control system in the context of human-robot interaction. It includes recordings from multiple microphones and a high-resolution camera, making it suitable for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the dataset entry includes the full citation as required.
