To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Robustness of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm in Ramp Metering Applications Considering False Data Injection Attack and Defense" by Diyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss ramp metering and the application of reinforcement learning, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they describe their experimental setup.

In **section 4 (Experiment)**, the authors mention that they built a **SUMO simulation testbed** for their analysis. They describe the configuration of the testbed, including the traffic demands and the algorithms tested. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **results section**. Here, they discuss the performance of different algorithms and the impact of adversarial data, but again, there is no specific dataset mentioned.

Since the paper does not explicitly provide names of datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies related to ramp metering and reinforcement learning, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets used in this research.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize publicly available datasets but instead created a simulation environment (SUMO) for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and results, it does not provide specific datasets with citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings regarding the absence of named datasets in the paper and note that the research primarily relies on a simulation framework rather than external datasets. This will be important for anyone looking to replicate or build upon this research.
