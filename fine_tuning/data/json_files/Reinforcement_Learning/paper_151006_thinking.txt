To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning-based decentralized TDMA for VLC IoT networks" by Armin Makvandi and Yousef Seifi Kavian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm and its evaluation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 3), where the authors discuss the implementation of their proposed algorithm on a VLC hardware system. They mention that the algorithm was implemented on a system called **VLCIoT**, which was designed and implemented in their laboratory. This indicates that the authors likely used this specific hardware setup for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup** subsection, the authors describe the parameters of the VLC IoT network, including the data rate, training data packet size, and other relevant metrics. However, they do not provide a separate dataset name or citation for the data used in their experiments. Instead, they refer to their own hardware system as the basis for their experiments.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for external datasets, I will note that the primary dataset used for evaluation is the data generated and collected through their own VLCIoT system. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that might refer to datasets or related works that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing various aspects of VLC and IoT technologies, rather than specific datasets.

In summary, the key points I will extract regarding datasets from this paper are:

1. **VLCIoT System**: The authors implemented their proposed algorithm on a VLC hardware system they designed, referred to as VLCIoT. This system serves as the basis for their experimental data.

2. **No External Datasets**: The paper does not mention any external datasets or provide citations for datasets used in their experiments. The data appears to be generated from their own hardware implementation.

Since there are no specific datasets with citations to extract, I will summarize the findings accordingly. 

Overall, the extraction process has shown that the authors primarily relied on their own experimental setup for data collection, and no external datasets were referenced in the paper.
