To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Robotic Manipulation via Graph-Based Hindsight Goal Generation" by Zhenshan Bing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the environments or datasets used for testing their proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention four specific robotic manipulation environments:

1. **FetchPushLabyrinth**: This environment involves pushing a cube around obstacles to reach a target goal.
2. **FetchPickObstacle**: In this scenario, the goal is to pick up a cube, lift it over an obstacle, and place it at a target position.
3. **FetchPickNoObstacle**: This environment is similar to the previous one but without any obstacles.
4. **FetchPickAndThrow**: This task involves picking up a cube and throwing it into one of several boxes.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, in this case, the environments are based on the standard robotic manipulation environments from OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known framework for reinforcement learning tasks.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym environments is:
> Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., & Zaremba, W. (2018). Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging Robotics Environments and Request for Research. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.00046.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym environments as the authoritative source for the datasets used in the experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
