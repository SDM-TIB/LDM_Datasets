To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation Matters in Deep Policy Gradients: A Case Study on PPO and TRPO" by Logan Engstrom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any subsections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, which may provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using several environments from the OpenAI Gym for their experiments, specifically:

1. **Humanoid-v2**: This environment is used for training agents to perform tasks in a simulated humanoid environment.
2. **Walker2d-v2**: Another environment from OpenAI Gym, focusing on bipedal locomotion tasks.
3. **Hopper-v2**: This environment is designed for training agents to control a one-legged hopper.

I will confirm the use of these datasets by checking the **results and discussion sections** to see how the authors reference these environments in the context of their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the citation related to the OpenAI Gym repository.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Prafulla Dhariwal, Christopher Hesse, Oleg Klimov, Alex Nichol, Matthias Plappert, Alec Radford, John Schulman, Szymon Sidor, Yuhuai Wu, and Peter Zhokhov. *OpenAI Baselines*. https://github.com/openai/baselines, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Humanoid-v2**
2. **Walker2d-v2**
3. **Hopper-v2**

And the citation for the OpenAI Gym, which encompasses these environments, is as follows:
> Prafulla Dhariwal et al. *OpenAI Baselines*. https://github.com/openai/baselines, 2017.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
