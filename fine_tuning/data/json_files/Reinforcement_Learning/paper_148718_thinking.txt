To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COCO: Controllable Counterfactuals for Evaluating Dialogue State Trackers" by Shiyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating dialogue state tracking models on the **MultiWOZ dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** section. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. I will focus on any explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments** section, the authors specifically mention the **MultiWOZ dataset** as the primary dataset used for their evaluations. They describe it as a large-scale multi-domain dataset for task-oriented dialogue modeling, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gasic, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **MultiWOZ dataset** is the only dataset relevant to this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its citation, into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
