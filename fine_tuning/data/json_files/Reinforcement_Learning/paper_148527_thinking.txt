To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Beamforming Techniques for Cell-Free Wireless Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Firas Fredj et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or evaluations. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were collected.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets, which can provide additional context.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Cell-Free Network Dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to include all necessary citation details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
