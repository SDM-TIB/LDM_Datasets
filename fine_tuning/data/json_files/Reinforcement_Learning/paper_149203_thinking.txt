To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Benefits of Intermediate Rewards for Goal-Reaching Policy Learning" by Yuexiang Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and may list the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MiniGrid environments** for their experiments. I will note this as it indicates the datasets or environments they utilized. I will also check if the authors provide any specific names or references for these environments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the **MiniGrid environments**, I will look for the following citation:
- Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract their citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
