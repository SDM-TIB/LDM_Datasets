To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Increasing Energy Efficiency of Massive-MIMO Network via Base Stations Switching using Reinforcement Learning and Radio Environment Maps" by Marcin Hoffmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a Radio Environment Map (REM) and reinforcement learning for energy efficiency in M-MIMO networks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these concepts.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. I will pay attention to any tables, figures, or references to data that might indicate the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. 

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the simulation environment and the parameters used, which may include datasets or references to existing datasets. I will also check if they mention any specific datasets used for training or testing their algorithms.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a specific dataset for evaluating the performance of their algorithms, I will ensure to note the dataset's name and its citation. If they refer to a well-known dataset, I will look up its citation in the literature to provide the correct reference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
