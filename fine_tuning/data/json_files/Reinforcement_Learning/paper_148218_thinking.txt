To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Predictor for Neural Architecture Search" by Wei Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the computational challenges of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and mention the use of the **NASBench-101** dataset as a benchmark for evaluating their method. This indicates that there is at least one dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (NASBench-101)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe NASBench-101 as a dataset that contains training, validation, and test results for all 423,624 models in the search space, which is crucial for their experiments.

The authors also mention that the dataset has specific properties, such as consistent training methods and the recommendation to use validation accuracies during the search process. This detailed description confirms that NASBench-101 is a key dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the NASBench-101 dataset in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Chris Ying, Aaron Klein, Esteban Real, Eric Christiansen, Kevin Murphy, and Frank Hutter. *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635, 2019.

Additionally, in **section 3.2 (ImageNet Experiments)**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet** dataset for their experiments. They describe the dataset as consisting of 1,281,167 training examples and 50,000 validation examples, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

I will also find the **full citation** for the ImageNet dataset in the **References section**. The citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets in the final output.
