To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nested Counterfactual Identification from Arbitrary Surrogate Experiments" by Juan D. Correa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to look deeper into the introduction and methodology for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on."

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it. This section often contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Causal Inference Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger study or paper, I will ensure to cite the original source accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and correctly formatted.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for presentation or further processing, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the information provided.
