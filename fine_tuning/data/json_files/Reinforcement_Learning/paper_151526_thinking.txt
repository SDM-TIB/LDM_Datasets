To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving" by Xiaosong Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a benchmark called **Bench2Drive**, which suggests that there is a dataset associated with it.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Bench2Drive)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that Bench2Drive consists of **2 million fully annotated frames** collected from **10,000 short clips** across various scenarios, weathers, and towns. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 4.1 (Baselines & Datasets)**, the authors confirm that they implemented several classic end-to-end autonomous driving methods using the Bench2Drive dataset. This section reinforces the importance of the dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the Bench2Drive dataset itself, but they do mention that all data, codes, and checkpoints are available on GitHub and Hugging Face under the Apache License 2.0. Therefore, I will cite the dataset as follows:

- **Bench2Drive Dataset**: 
  > Xiaosong Jia, Zhenjie Yang, Qifeng Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Junchi Yan. *Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023. Available at: https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive and https://huggingface.co/datasets/rethinlab/Bench2Drive.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation for future reference or use.
