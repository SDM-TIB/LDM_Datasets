To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep In-GPU Experience Replay" by Ben Parr, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the training of an agent to play Super Smash Bros. Melee, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to gameplay experiences.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly section 4, which details the integration of the in-GPU experience replay with the reinforcement learning algorithm. Here, I will look for any specific datasets or gameplay data that the agent was trained on.

In section 3 (Data), the paper describes the gameplay data generated by 50 workers playing Melee in parallel. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation. Instead, it mentions that the agent was trained on gameplay data generated from the game Super Smash Bros. Melee, which is a well-known game but not a dataset in the traditional sense.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets or related works are cited that could provide context or additional datasets. The references include various papers related to reinforcement learning and the use of experience replay, but they do not specifically cite a dataset for Super Smash Bros. Melee.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will note that the primary data source is gameplay data from Super Smash Bros. Melee, which is generated through emulation and not a publicly available dataset. 

To summarize, the key points regarding the dataset extraction are:
1. The primary data source is gameplay data from Super Smash Bros. Melee, generated by the author's team.
2. There are no formal datasets or citations provided in the paper for external datasets.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to note the lack of formal dataset citations while acknowledging the gameplay data source.
