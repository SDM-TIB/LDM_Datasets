To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Factor-Based Framework for Decision-Making Competency Self-Assessment" by Brett W. Israelsen and Nisar Ahmed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the study and its objectives, which could hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any experiments or analyses that involve specific datasets. This section often contains detailed information about the data collection process, including the names and characteristics of the datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. They may mention datasets in the context of their experiments or when comparing their results to previous work.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely for explicit mentions of dataset names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "the MTurk dataset" in their experiments, I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to capture the full citation, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
