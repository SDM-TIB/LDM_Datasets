To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimisation of MCTS Player for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" by K. Godlewski and B. Sawicki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction will give context about the game and its significance, which might lead to identifying specific datasets or resources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training or testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a game simulator and various agent players, but they do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they describe the game mechanics and the parameters used in their simulations. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset is the game itself, which is simulated rather than sourced from an external dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. This could include references to previous studies or datasets that informed their research.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets from external sources, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Game Simulator**: The authors developed a simulator for "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game," which serves as the primary dataset for their experiments. The simulator allows for multiple configurations and testing of different agent strategies.

2. **Parameters for Game Complexity**: The paper outlines parameters that control the complexity of the game, which can be considered as a dataset for the experiments. These parameters include the number of cards and types of cards used in different difficulty levels.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant citations from the references section that pertain to the game or methodologies discussed.

Since there are no traditional datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the primary data source is the game simulator developed by the authors, and I will provide the citation for the paper itself:

- Godlewski, K., & Sawicki, B. (2016). Optimisation of MCTS Player for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. *Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences*, XX(Y), 1-10. DOI: 10.1515/bpasts-2016-00ZZ.

With this approach, I ensure that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while also providing the necessary citations.
