To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering Complex Control in MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Deheng Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an AI agent for the MOBA game "Honor of Kings," which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention testing their AI agent against professional players and in public matches, which implies the use of gameplay data. I will look for any specific datasets or data sources mentioned in this context.

In the **system setup section**, the authors detail their experimental framework and mention the use of "Honor of Kings" as the testbed for their experiments. This indicates that gameplay data from this game is likely a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **appendix and references sections** for any additional datasets or sources that may not have been explicitly mentioned in the main body of the paper. The references may include citations for datasets or related works that provide datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I find into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. Based on the content of the paper, I anticipate the following datasets:

1. **Honor of Kings Gameplay Data**: This dataset consists of gameplay data collected from matches played in the "Honor of Kings" game, which is used to train and evaluate the AI agent.

For the citation of the dataset, I will refer to the original game developers or any relevant publications that describe the dataset. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the gameplay data, I will note that it is derived from the game itself.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are provided where applicable. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research by others interested in this area.
