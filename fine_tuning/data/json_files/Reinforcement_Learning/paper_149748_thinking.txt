To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-Induced Representation Learning" by Jun Yamada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of representation learning approaches in visually complex environments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that describe the environments used for testing. The authors mention four visually complex environments: **Distracting DMControl**, **ViZDoom**, **Distracting MetaWorld**, and **CARLA**. I will extract details about these environments, as they are likely to contain datasets used for the experiments.

1. **Distracting DMControl**: This environment is based on the DMControl suite, where the visual complexity is increased by overlaying videos from the DAVIS 2017 dataset. The authors reference the original work by Stone et al. (2021) for this dataset.

2. **ViZDoom**: This environment is based on the Doom game and uses pre-trained models from Dosovitskiy and Koltun (2017) for data collection. The dataset is not explicitly named but is derived from the game environment.

3. **Distracting MetaWorld**: This environment is based on the MetaWorld benchmark, which is referenced in the paper by Yu et al. (2020). The authors mention that they overlay videos from the DAVIS 2017 dataset, similar to the Distracting DMControl.

4. **CARLA**: The CARLA simulator is used for autonomous driving scenarios, and the authors reference the original CARLA paper by Dosovitskiy et al. (2017) for the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **DAVIS 2017 dataset**, the citation is:

- For **DMControl**, the citation is:

  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its source.
