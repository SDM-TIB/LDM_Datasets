To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Drive Anywhere" by Ruizhao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method across multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Argoverse 2 (AV2)**: This dataset is referenced as a next-generation dataset for self-driving perception and forecasting. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset, such as its purpose and the number of samples used.

2. **nuScenes (nS)**: This dataset is described as a multimodal dataset for autonomous driving. I will look for any specific metrics or characteristics mentioned that define its use in the study.

3. **Waymo (Waymo)**: The authors mention this dataset as well, and I will ensure to capture any relevant details about its application in their research.

In this section, the authors also provide information about how they processed the raw data from these datasets to create ground truth waypoints, which is essential for understanding their methodology.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I will look for include:

- For **Argoverse 2**:
  > Wilson, B., Qi, W., Agarwal, T., Lambert, J., Singh, J., Khandelwal, S., Pan, B., Kumar, R., Hartnett, A., Pontes, J. K., et al. (2021). Argoverse 2.0: Next generation datasets for self-driving perception and forecasting. In NeurIPS.

- For **nuScenes**:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., & Beijbom, O. (2020). nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving. In CVPR.

- For **Waymo**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
