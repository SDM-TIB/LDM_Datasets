To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Tuan Dam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or utilized in the experiments. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and specific characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in sections discussing empirical evaluations or experiments. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because the citation provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari 2600** as a benchmark for testing, I would look for the citation that corresponds to the original source of the Atari dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
