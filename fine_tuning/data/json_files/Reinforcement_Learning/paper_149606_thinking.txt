To extract datasets from the research paper titled "skrl: Modular and Flexible Library for Reinforcement Learning" by Antonio Serrano-MuÃ±oz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of reinforcement learning and the development of libraries, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe experiments conducted to evaluate the library's performance. Here, they mention using various environments for testing, such as the **OpenAI Gym** and **NVIDIA Isaac Gym**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather environments for reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous research. The authors reference several libraries and frameworks, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with detailed descriptions or citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, I will still compile the references to the environments and libraries mentioned, as they are relevant to the context of the research. The references include:

Since no datasets were identified, I will not create any dataset entries. Instead, I will summarize the findings and note that the paper primarily discusses the library's capabilities and its evaluation in various environments rather than specific datasets.
