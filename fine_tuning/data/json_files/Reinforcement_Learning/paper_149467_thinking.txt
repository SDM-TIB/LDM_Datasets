To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Pseudo Projection Operator: Applications of Deep Learning to Projection Based Filtering in Non-Trivial Frequency Regimes" by Matthew L. Weiss et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music Performance Dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (URMP Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that the dataset consists of multi-instrument recordings of musical pieces, with specific details about how the data is processed and structured. The authors describe the dataset's dimensions and the preprocessing steps taken, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

In this section, they also mention generating three types of datasets: clean, shuffle, and outliers. This indicates that there are multiple variations of the original dataset used for different experimental conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music Performance Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music Performance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bochen Li, Xinzhao Liu, Karthik Dinesh, Zhiyao Duan, and Gaurav Sharma. *Creating a multitrack classical music performance dataset for multimodal music analysis: Challenges, insights, and applications*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 522â€“535, 2019.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
