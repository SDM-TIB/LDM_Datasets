To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realizing Petabyte Scale Acoustic Modeling" by Sree Hari Krishnan Parthasarathi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of **1 Million hours of audio data** for training acoustic models, which indicates that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention various datasets used in their experiments. They specifically refer to three training datasets: a **1,000 hour fully labeled dataset**, a **7,000 hour fully labeled dataset**, and a **1 Million hour unlabeled dataset**. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They mention that the **1,000 hour dataset** is a subset of the **7,000 hour dataset**, which is used for training the teacher model. The **1 Million hour dataset** is used for building the semi-supervised learning (SSL) model. This confirms the datasets I need to include.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer that the datasets are derived from the production data of the Alexa family of devices. Therefore, I will note the following:

1. **1,000 hour fully labeled dataset**: This dataset is part of the Alexa production data but does not have a specific citation in the paper.
2. **7,000 hour fully labeled dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is also part of the Alexa production data without a specific citation.
3. **1 Million hour unlabeled dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for SSL model building, again derived from Alexa production data.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will document them as follows:

- For the **1,000 hour fully labeled dataset**:
  > Derived from the production data of the Alexa family of devices.

- For the **7,000 hour fully labeled dataset**:
  > Derived from the production data of the Alexa family of devices.

- For the **1 Million hour unlabeled dataset**:
  > Derived from the production data of the Alexa family of devices.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of each dataset and its source, even if formal citations are not provided. This will ensure clarity and completeness in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
