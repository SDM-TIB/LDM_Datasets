To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AoI Minimization in Status Update Control with Energy Harvesting Sensors" by Mohammad Hatami, Markus Leinonen, and Marian Codreanu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of information freshness in IoT applications, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their simulations or evaluations. In this case, the authors might refer to specific datasets or benchmarks that they used to validate their methods.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to find explicit mentions of datasets. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Energy Harvesting Sensor Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
