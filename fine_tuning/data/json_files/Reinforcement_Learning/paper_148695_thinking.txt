To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Collaboration via Reward Attribution Decomposition" by Tianjun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, CollaQ, on the **StarCraft multi-agent challenge**, which suggests that this challenge may be a dataset or benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that CollaQ is evaluated on various **StarCraft maps**, which indicates that the StarCraft multi-agent challenge is indeed a dataset or benchmark.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the StarCraft multi-agent challenge. The relevant citation is:

- **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge**: 
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems, pages 2186â€“2188. International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to confirm the datasets used.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this approach, I have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the paper.
