To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jam Me If You Can: Defeating Jammer with Deep Dueling Neural Network Architecture and Ambient Backscattering Augmented Communications" by Nguyen Van Huynh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulations to evaluate the proposed anti-jamming framework, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to look for specific datasets used in the simulations. I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention any datasets explicitly, I will note them down.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional context about the datasets, such as how they were used in the experiments or any performance metrics associated with them. This will help me understand the relevance and application of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include the original papers or sources where these datasets can be found. If they have created their own datasets, I will look for any details provided about them, such as how they were collected or constructed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and future use.
