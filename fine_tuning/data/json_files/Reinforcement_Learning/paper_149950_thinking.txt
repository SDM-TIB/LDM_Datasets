To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Finding Non-Exploitable Strategies in Two-Player Atari Games" by Zihan Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on various two-player Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for their evaluations. They specifically mention using five two-player Atari games from the PettingZoo library and a benchmark environment called Slime Volley-Ball. This indicates that these games are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics or how they were utilized in the experiments. The authors provide a list of the games used, which includes:

1. **Slime Volley-Ball**: A benchmark environment for evaluating two-player strategies.
2. **Boxing**: An Atari game included in the PettingZoo library.
3. **Double Dunk**: Another Atari game from the same library.
4. **Pong**: A classic Atari game used for testing.
5. **Tennis**: An additional two-player game from the Atari collection.
6. **Surround**: The last game mentioned in the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper cites the PettingZoo library, which is crucial for understanding the source of the Atari games. The citation for the PettingZoo library is:

- **PettingZoo**:

Additionally, the Slime Volley-Ball environment is referenced as follows:

- **Slime Volley-Ball**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
