To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vector logic allows counterfactual virtualization by The Square Root of NOT" by Eduardo Mizraji, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the research, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of empirical data or studies that may involve datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss methodology or experiments. I will look for any references to datasets used for analysis or validation of the proposed methods. If the paper includes a **results** or **discussion** section, I will also check there for any datasets that may have been utilized to support the findings.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets. Sometimes, datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies or methodologies that the current research builds upon. If the paper mentions any datasets, I will ensure to note their names and any relevant details provided.

If I find any datasets, I will then look for full citations for each dataset. This may involve checking the references provided in the paper or conducting a brief search for the datasets online to ensure I have the correct citation format.

For example, if I find a dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
