To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal Recognition as Reinforcement Learning" by Leonardo Amado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and related work, which might reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation methods and the environments used for testing. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets or environments that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **PDDLGym** as their evaluation environment, which is a framework that constructs OpenAI Gym environments from PDDL domains. This indicates that the datasets are derived from PDDL domains, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are explicitly named.

In the experimental evaluation, the authors refer to three specific domains: **Blocks, Hanoi, and SkGrid**. These domains are commonly used in goal recognition tasks and serve as the basis for their experiments. However, I need to ensure that these domains are indeed treated as datasets in the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The authors may not provide traditional datasets but rather reference the environments they used for their experiments. 

For the **PDDLGym** environment, the citation is:
> Silver, T., & Chitnis, R. (2020). *PDDLGym: Gym environments from PDDL problems*. CoRR, abs/2002.06432.

For the specific domains used in the experiments, I will cite them as follows:
- **Blocks Domain**: This domain is commonly referenced in planning and goal recognition literature, but I will check for a specific citation in the context of this paper.
- **Hanoi Domain**: Similarly, this is a well-known problem in computer science, and I will ensure to provide a citation if available.
- **SkGrid Domain**: This domain is mentioned in the context of the experiments, and I will look for any specific references.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
