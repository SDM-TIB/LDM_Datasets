To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zap Q-learning with Nonlinear Function Approximation" by Shuhang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the Zap Q-learning algorithm on examples from OpenAI Gym, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they tested their algorithm on three examples from OpenAI Gym: **Mountain Car**, **Acrobot**, and **Cartpole**. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The OpenAI Gym is a well-known platform, and I can find its citation as follows:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > OpenAI Gym website. github.com/openai/gym/wiki.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets beyond the environments used in OpenAI Gym, I will note that the datasets are the environments themselves.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for OpenAI Gym as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Mountain Car** - part of the OpenAI Gym.
2. **Acrobot** - part of the OpenAI Gym.
3. **Cartpole** - part of the OpenAI Gym.

The full citation for the dataset source is:
> OpenAI Gym website. github.com/openai/gym/wiki.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets referenced in the research paper.
