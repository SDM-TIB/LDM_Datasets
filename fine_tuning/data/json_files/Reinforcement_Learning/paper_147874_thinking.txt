To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On-Policy Trust Region Policy Optimisation with Replay Buffers" by Dmitry Kangin and Nicolas Pugeault, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its improvements but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction provides context about reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors compare their method against other algorithms. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on the **MuJoCo** robotic simulations. This indicates that the MuJoCo environment is a dataset used for their experiments.

To gather more details, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MuJoCo dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MuJoCo**:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MuJoCo dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MuJoCo environment, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
