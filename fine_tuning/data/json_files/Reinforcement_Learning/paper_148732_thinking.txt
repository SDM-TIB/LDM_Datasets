To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Value-Equivalence Principle for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Christopher Grimm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including any references to prior works that may have introduced these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to reinforcement learning experiments, which may include standard benchmarks or custom datasets created by the authors. I will ensure to note down the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Document the datasets with their names, descriptions, and citations in a clear format.
