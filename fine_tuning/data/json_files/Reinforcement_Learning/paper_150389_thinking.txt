To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Shortcut Learning in Deep Neural Networks: An Iterative Approach with Interpretable Models" by Shantanu Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that lists the datasets along with the corresponding blackbox models used for each dataset. This table is crucial as it summarizes the datasets utilized in the experiments.

From **Table 1**, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **CUB-200**: This dataset is referenced as "CUB-200 (Wah et al., 2011)" and is used for fine-grained classification of bird species. 

2. **AWA2**: This dataset is referred to as "AWA2 (Xian et al., 2018)" and consists of images of animals with attributes for zero-shot learning.

3. **HAM10000**: This dataset is mentioned as "HAM10000 (Tschandl et al., 2018)" and is used for skin lesion classification.

4. **SIIM-ISIC**: This dataset is referenced as "SIIM-ISIC (Rotemberg et al., 2021)" and is used for melanoma classification.

5. **MIMIC-CXR**: This dataset is noted as "MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al.)" and is used for classifying effusion in chest X-rays.

6. **Waterbirds**: This dataset is mentioned as "Waterbirds (Sagawa et al., 2019)" and is used to study shortcut learning in the context of bird classification.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- **CUB-200**:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*.

- **Waterbirds**:
  > Sagawa, S., Koh, P. W., Hashimoto, T. B., & Liang, P. (2019). *Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
