To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA: Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Zahra Zamanzadeh Darban et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on **seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)**: This dataset consists of 27 datasets collected from NASA spacecraft, with a total of 58,317 training samples and 73,729 test samples. The anomaly ratio is 10.72%.

2. **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)**: This dataset includes 55 datasets with 140,825 training samples and 444,035 test samples, having an anomaly ratio of 13.13%.

3. **Server Machine Dataset (SMD)**: Comprising 28 datasets, this dataset has 708,405 training samples and 708,420 test samples, with an anomaly ratio of 4.16%.

4. **Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)**: This dataset contains 1 dataset with 496,800 training samples and 449,919 test samples, and an anomaly ratio of 12.33%.

5. **Water Distribution Testbed (WADI)**: This dataset includes 1 dataset with 784,568 training samples and 172,801 test samples, with an anomaly ratio of 5.77%.

6. **Yahoo - A1 Benchmark**: This dataset consists of 67 univariate time series with 46,667 training samples and 46,717 test samples, having an anomaly ratio of 1.76%.

7. **Key Performance Indicators (KPI)**: This dataset includes 29 datasets with 1,048,576 training samples and 2,918,847 test samples, with an anomaly ratio of 1.87%.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
