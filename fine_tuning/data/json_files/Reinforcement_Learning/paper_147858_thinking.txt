To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Computation Offloading for Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Zhao Chen and Xiaodong Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategy but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if any datasets are used for evaluation. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors describe the simulation setup and mention that they use a simulated environment to generate training and testing data. However, they do not specify any real-world datasets used in their experiments. This suggests that the authors may have created their own datasets for the purpose of this study.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are mentioned in the context of previous works. However, it appears that the references primarily cite other research papers rather than datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any explicit datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references and summarize their characteristics as needed.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and if any had been identified, I would have provided their full citations and descriptions accordingly.
