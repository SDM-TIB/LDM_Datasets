To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Delay Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Anindya Sarkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to find explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental setup, including the environments used for testing their proposed attacks. I will look for any specific names of datasets or environments that are utilized in their experiments.

In this case, the authors mention using **Atari games** in the OpenAI Gym as their experimental environments. Specifically, they refer to **Pong** and **Breakout** as the two games used for evaluating their attack strategies. These environments are well-known benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The OpenAI Gym is a widely recognized platform, and its citation is typically included in the references. I will ensure to note the citation format used in the paper.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the authors did not mention any additional datasets beyond the Atari environments, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Atari Pong**: An environment used for reinforcement learning experiments.
2. **Atari Breakout**: Another environment used for reinforcement learning experiments.
3. **OpenAI Gym**: The platform that provides these environments.

I will ensure to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as it is crucial for proper attribution in any dataset extraction process.
