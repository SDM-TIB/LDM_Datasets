To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI Research Platform for Visual Reinforcement Learning" by Michał Kempka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their platform using two scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these scenarios.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they detail two specific experiments: a basic move-and-shoot task and a maze-navigation problem. I will look for any datasets or environments that are used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not reference external datasets but instead describe the **ViZDoom platform** itself as a customizable environment for reinforcement learning. They mention that the platform allows for the creation of custom scenarios, which means that the datasets are generated within the context of the ViZDoom environment rather than sourced from external datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets from external sources, I will note that the primary dataset is the **ViZDoom environment** itself, which is a simulation platform rather than a traditional dataset. The authors provide a link to the ViZDoom platform, which can be considered a resource for generating data through various scenarios.

Now, I will compile the relevant information regarding the ViZDoom platform and its scenarios into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself as the source of this information.

The citation for the paper is:
> Michał Kempka, Marek Wydmuch, Grzegorz Runc, Jakub Toczek, and Wojciech Jaśkowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI Research Platform for Visual Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Games (CoG), 2016.

In summary, I will document the ViZDoom platform as the primary dataset, along with the citation for the paper, and note that the scenarios are customizable and generated within the platform itself.
