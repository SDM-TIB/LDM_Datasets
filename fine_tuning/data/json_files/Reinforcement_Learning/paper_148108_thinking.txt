To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Inference of Reward Machines and Policies for Reinforcement Learning" by Zhe Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments, particularly in sections that describe the experimental setup or results. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning tasks, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
