To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deterministic Value-Policy Gradients" by Qingpeng Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several standard continuous control benchmarks. I will specifically look for the names of these benchmarks in the text. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the following datasets:

1. **InvertedPendulum-v2**: A benchmark environment in the OpenAI Gym for testing reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **Hopper-v2**: Another benchmark environment in the OpenAI Gym, designed for testing continuous control algorithms.
3. **HumanoidStandup-v2**: A more complex environment in the OpenAI Gym that involves a humanoid robot standing up.
4. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A benchmark environment in the OpenAI Gym that simulates a cheetah running.
5. **Ant-v2**: A benchmark environment in the OpenAI Gym that simulates an ant navigating through a terrain.
6. **Swimmer-v2**: A benchmark environment in the OpenAI Gym that simulates a swimming task.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are standard environments in the OpenAI Gym, they may not have formal citations in the same way that datasets from specific research papers do. Instead, I can refer to the OpenAI Gym documentation for the environments.

For the OpenAI Gym environments, I will use the following citation:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the experiments and their corresponding citations, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
