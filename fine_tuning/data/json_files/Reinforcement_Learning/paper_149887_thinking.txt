To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plug and Play Counterfactual Text Generation for Model Robustness" by Nishtha Madaan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the generation of counterfactual test cases, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list two datasets:

1. **YELP Sentiment Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used to evaluate how well the model can change the sentiment of the original text. The authors cite the original source of this dataset as:
   > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pages 649–657.

2. **IMDB Sentiment Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned for evaluating sentiment changes in the text. The citation provided for this dataset is:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, A., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their relevance by checking if they are mentioned in the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the evaluation of their model. The datasets are indeed used for testing the effectiveness of the CASPer framework in generating counterfactuals.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
