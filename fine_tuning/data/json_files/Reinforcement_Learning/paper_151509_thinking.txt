To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shared-unique Features and Task-aware Prioritized Sampling on Multi-task Reinforcement Learning" by Po-Shao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed method, STARS, is verified through experiments on the **Meta-World benchmark**, which indicates that this benchmark is likely a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or specific datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the performance of STARS on the Meta-World benchmark, which is a well-known dataset for multi-task reinforcement learning.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention that they evaluate STARS on the **Meta-World benchmark**, which consists of two tracks: **MT-10** and **MT-50**. I will note down these details as they are crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Meta-World benchmark. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Meta-World benchmark**:
  > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1094â€“1100. PMLR, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Meta-World benchmark**: This benchmark is used for evaluating multi-task reinforcement learning methods and consists of two tracks (MT-10 and MT-50) with various robot manipulation tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation as required.
