To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Intra-Household Educational Inequalities: Gender, Birth Order, and Ability Dynamics in Beninâ€™s Households" by Christelle Zozoungbo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the context of the research and mentions the use of data from the **2013 Population and Habitation Census of Benin**. This is a significant dataset that I need to note.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Description and Definition of Key Variables)**, where the author elaborates on the dataset used for analysis. Here, the author states that the census data provides comprehensive insights into households and their members, specifically focusing on children aged between 25 and 40 years. This section also describes key variables derived from the dataset, such as gender, age, educational attainment, and household characteristics.

The author mentions that the sample comprises approximately **90,000 individuals and 32,000 households**, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset is the **2013 Population and Habitation Census of Benin**, which I will cite as follows:

- **2013 Population and Habitation Census of Benin**: National Bureau of Statistics of Benin. *2013 Population and Habitation Census*. Benin.

Since this is the main dataset referenced throughout the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference.
