To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automaton-Guided Curriculum Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Yash Shukla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experimental results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments conducted. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to specific environments or tasks that may imply the use of datasets. For example, the authors mention "grid-world" and "physics-based simulated robotics domains," which may indicate the use of specific datasets or simulation environments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Roboschool," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note that and provide a brief description based on the context provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly, making it easy for others to understand the datasets used in the research and how they contribute to the findings presented in the paper.
