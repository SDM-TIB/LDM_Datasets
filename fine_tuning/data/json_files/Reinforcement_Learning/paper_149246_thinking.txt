To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory-Aware Partitioning of Machine Learning Applications for Optimal Energy Use in Batteryless Systems" by Andres Gomez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the context of the research.

In this paper, the authors mention two specific applications: a thermal camera system and a vision camera system. I will check if they provide any datasets related to these applications, such as images or energy consumption data.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "OV7670" or "Lepton" in the context of their experiments, I will ensure to find the appropriate citations for these datasets:

- For the **OV7670 camera**, I will look for its datasheet or relevant publications that describe its specifications and usage.
- For the **Lepton thermal camera**, I will do the same, ensuring to capture the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
