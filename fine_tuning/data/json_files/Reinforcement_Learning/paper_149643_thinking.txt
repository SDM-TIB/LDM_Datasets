To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-driven Planner for Exploration and Navigation" by Georgios Georgakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted using the **Matterport3D** dataset, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors state that their experiments are conducted on the **Matterport3D (MP3D)** dataset using the Habitat simulator. This confirms that the Matterport3D dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Matterport3D dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. 2017 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV). IEEE.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Matterport3D dataset, I will document this dataset in detail.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented dataset entry that is ready for review or further processing.
