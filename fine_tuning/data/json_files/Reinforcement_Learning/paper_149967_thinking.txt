To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Actor-Critic Ensemble for Uncertainty-Aware Continuous Control" by Takuya Kanazawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting numerical experiments in various simulation environments, specifically highlighting environments like **HopperBulletEnv-v0** and **PowerGym**.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets or environments in the **experiments section**. For instance, the paper describes using the **HopperBulletEnv-v0** environment, which is a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks. Additionally, the authors mention using the **PowerGym** simulator for power grid control tasks, which includes environments like "34Bus".

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. The paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, but I can infer that the environments are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

1. **HopperBulletEnv-v0**: This environment is part of the PyBullet physics simulation suite, which is widely used for robotic simulations. The citation for the PyBullet simulator is:
   > "PyBullet: A Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning." Available at: https://pybullet.org/wordpress/

2. **PowerGym**: This is a reinforcement learning environment for power distribution systems. The citation for the PowerGym simulator is:
   > Fan, T.-H., Lee, X. Y., & Wang, Y. (2021). "PowerGym: A reinforcement learning environment for Volt-Var control in power distribution systems." arXiv:2109.03970.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for reference.
