To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Inference Scheme Based on Pipelined Matrix Multiplication Acceleration Design and Non-uniform Quantization" by Yuyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the implementation is tested on **handwritten digit classification and Q-learning tasks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.3 (Dataset used in Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **MNIST dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset, stating that it contains a total of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with each image being 28x28 pixels. This is a clear identification of the dataset used for the handwritten digit recognition task.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the correct citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Confirming the dataset details in the relevant section (4.3).
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset.
