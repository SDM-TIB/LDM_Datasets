To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Causal Models for Counterfactual Estimation" by Pedro Sanchez and Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their method on imaging datasets, specifically mentioning **MNIST** and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, they explicitly mention using **MNIST** and **ImageNet** for their experiments. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors refer to the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors also mention the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset used for image classification and object detection. It contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, IEEE, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
