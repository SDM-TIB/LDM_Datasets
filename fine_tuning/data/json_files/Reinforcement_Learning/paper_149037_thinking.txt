To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actionable Models: Unsupervised Offline Reinforcement Learning of Robotic Skills" by Yevgen Chebotar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses learning from offline data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using data from various robotic manipulation tasks, specifically stating that they have over 800,000 episodes of data collected from different tasks.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **related work section** or **references** that might provide more context or specific dataset names. The authors reference prior works and datasets that may have been used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using data from a previous research project, which is crucial for identifying the dataset. They state that the data comes from reinforcement learning experiments conducted on KUKA robots, but they do not provide a specific dataset name.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the datasets used. The authors reference their own previous work, which may contain the dataset details.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries with full citations. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Robotic Manipulation Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 800,000 episodes collected from various robotic tasks, including grasping and pick-and-place skills. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kalashnikov, D., Irpan, A., Pastor, P., Ibarz, J., Herzog, A., Jang, E., Quillen, D., Holly, E., Kalakrishnan, M., Vanhoucke, V., and Levine, S. *QT-Opt: Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation*. arXiv, abs/1806.10293, 2018.

2. **Simulated Visual Goal Reaching Dataset**: This dataset is generated from RL runs for specific tasks, but the authors do not provide a specific citation for it. However, it is derived from the same framework as the previous dataset.

Now, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, and I will format them appropriately for inclusion in the final output. 

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference.
