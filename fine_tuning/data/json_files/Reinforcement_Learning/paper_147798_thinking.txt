To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PPO-CMA: Proximal Policy Optimization with Covariance Matrix Adaptation" by Perttu Hämäläinen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of PPO-CMA on Roboschool continuous control benchmarks, which suggests that datasets related to these benchmarks may be included.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors mention using the **9 OpenAI Gym Roboschool continuous control environments** for hyperparameter searches and evaluations. This indicates that these environments are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about these environments in the paper. The authors list the environments as follows:

1. **Inverted Pendulum**
2. **Inverted Pendulum Swing-Up**
3. **Inverted Double Pendulum**
4. **Reacher**
5. **Hopper**
6. **Walker2d**
7. **HalfCheetah**
8. **Ant**
9. **Pong**

These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, which is widely used for reinforcement learning tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym and Roboschool datasets. The relevant citation is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **Roboschool**:
  > OpenAI. *Roboschool*. https://blog.openai.com/roboschool/, 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper and gathered the necessary citations to document them properly.
