To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRAIN ON SMALL, PLAY THE LARGE: SCALING UP BOARD GAMES WITH ALPHAZERO AND GNN" by Shai Ben-Assayag and Ran El-Yaniv, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed model, ScalableAlphaZero, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the model but does not mention datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention conducting experiments on three scalable board games: **Othello**, **Gomoku**, and **Go**. This indicates that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments, but I need to find the full citations for these games.

In the evaluation section, the authors describe the games in detail, including their rules and complexities, but they do not provide formal citations for the datasets. However, I can infer that the games themselves are well-known and have established references.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will look for references in the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the following works related to the games:

1. For **Othello**, the citation is:
   > Ted Landau. *Othello: Brief & basic*. US Othello Association, 1985.

2. For **Go**, the citation is:
   > Arthur Smith. *The game of go: the national game of Japan*. Moffat, Yard, 1908.

The authors do not provide a specific citation for **Gomoku**, but it is a widely recognized game, often referenced in literature without a formal dataset citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

- **Othello**: A board game used as a dataset for training and evaluation.
  Citation: Ted Landau. *Othello: Brief & basic*. US Othello Association, 1985.

- **Gomoku**: A board game used as a dataset for training and evaluation. (No formal citation provided, but it is a well-known game.)

- **Go**: A board game used as a dataset for training and evaluation.
  Citation: Arthur Smith. *The game of go: the national game of Japan*. Moffat, Yard, 1908.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
