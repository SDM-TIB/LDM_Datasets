To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Control for Disturbance Rejection in a Nonlinear Dynamic System with Parametric Uncertainty" by Vincent W. Hill, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may discuss the context and significance of the research, which could hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **technical approach section**, particularly where the author describes the modeling of the Flexible Inverted Pendulum with Cart (FIPWC) system. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or simulation parameters that could be considered datasets. 

In this paper, the author does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, the research relies on simulations and mathematical modeling, which are generated based on specific parameters and stochastic processes. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather simulation data generated from the FIPWC model.

I will also check the **appendix and references** for any additional information regarding the simulation parameters or any external datasets that might have been referenced. The references include various works that may have contributed to the methodology but do not indicate any datasets used in the traditional sense.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Data from FIPWC Model**: The paper describes the generation of simulation data based on the FIPWC model, which is influenced by stochastic disturbances and parametric uncertainty. However, this data is not sourced from an external dataset but is rather produced through the authors' simulations.

2. **References for Methodology**: While there are no datasets to cite, I will note the references that support the methodology used in the simulations. These references include foundational works in deep reinforcement learning and control systems.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting that there are no traditional datasets to cite, but I will include the relevant references that support the research methodology.
