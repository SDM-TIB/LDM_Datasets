To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Target Transfer Q-Learning and Its Convergence Analysis" by Yue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can indicate whether empirical evaluations were conducted, which often involve datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the experiments section does not provide sufficient information, I will check the **related work section**. Authors often reference datasets used in previous studies, which may also be relevant to their own work.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After gathering this information, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Synthetic MDPs" for their experiments, I would look for a citation that describes this dataset in detail, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further studies or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
