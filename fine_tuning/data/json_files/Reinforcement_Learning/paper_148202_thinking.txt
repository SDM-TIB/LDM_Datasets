To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Join Query Optimization with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" by Jonas Heitz and Kurt Stockinger, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a benchmark called the **Join Order Benchmark (JOB)**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **IMDB dataset** as part of the JOB benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In section 5.1, the authors describe the JOB benchmark in detail, stating that it consists of queries with 3 to 16 joins and is based on the IMDB dataset. They provide information about the dataset size and its characteristics, which is essential for documenting the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Join Order Benchmark (JOB)**: The authors reference the work by Leis et al. (2015) that introduced this benchmark. The citation is:
   > Viktor Leis, Andrey Gubichev, Atanas Mirchev, Peter Boncz, Alfons Kemper, and Thomas Neumann. *How good are query optimizers, really?* Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9(3):204â€“215, 2015.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: The authors mention that the IMDB dataset is freely available and used for the JOB benchmark. The citation is:
   > IMDB Inc. *IMDB*. https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/, 2019.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details about each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation.
