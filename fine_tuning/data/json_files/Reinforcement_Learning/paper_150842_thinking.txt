To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAF-Net: Self-Attention Fusion Network for Myocardial Infarction Detection using Multi-View Echocardiography" by Ilke Adalioglu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and the significance of their work. They reference the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset** again, indicating its importance in their study.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors provide detailed information about the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset**, stating that it consists of 320 echocardiography recordings from 160 individuals, including both MI patients and non-MI subjects. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset**. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly shared at a Kaggle repository, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset** is:
> Degerli A, Sohrab F, Kiranyaz S, Gabbouj M. Early myocardial infarction detection with one-class classification over multi-view echocardiography. In Comput. Cardiol. (CinC), volume 498. 2022; 1â€“4.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **HMC-QU-TAU dataset** and ensure it is ready for further processing or review.
