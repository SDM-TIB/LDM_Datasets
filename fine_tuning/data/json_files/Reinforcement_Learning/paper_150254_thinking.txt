To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An adaptive human-in-the-loop approach to emission detection of Additive Manufacturing processes and active learning with computer vision" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the collection of emission data during the Additive Manufacturing (AM) process, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Creation of Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the first dataset consists of 11,000 images collected from the in-situ monitoring system, specifically from the melt pool conditions of 11 dog-bone shaped testing parts made of Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V). They also state that 150 images were labeled as defected samples and another 150 as normal samples, creating a ground truth dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors provide two datasets:

1. **Emission Images Defect Samples**: This dataset contains 150 labeled images of defective samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > XIAO LIU. “emission images defect samples”. In: (Oct. 2022). DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.21280104.v1. URL: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/emission_images_defect_samples/21280104.

2. **Emission Images Normal Samples**: This dataset contains 150 labeled images of normal samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > XIAO LIU. “emission images normal samples”. In: (Oct. 2022). DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.21280173.v1. URL: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/emission_images_normal_samples/21280173.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described, and the full citations will be included to ensure proper attribution.
