To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hidden State Guidance: Improving Image Captioning Using an Image Conditioned Autoencoder" by Jialin Wu and Raymond J. Mooney, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel framework for image captioning, but it does not specify any datasets. Moving to the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section (Section 3)**, the authors mention using the **MSCOCO 2015 dataset** for image captioning. They specify that they utilize the Karpathy configuration, which includes 110K images for training and 5K images each for validation and test. This is a clear indication of the dataset being used.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.-Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **MSCOCO 2015 Dataset**: Used for image captioning, includes 110K images for training and 5K images each for validation and test.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.-Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and cited the dataset used in the research paper.
