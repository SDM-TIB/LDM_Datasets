To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mycorrhizal association of common European tree species shapes biomass and metabolic activity of bacterial and fungal communities in soil" by Petr HedÄ›nec et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets or experiments conducted.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or experiments that the authors used to support their claims. This section often outlines the background and rationale for the study, which may include references to existing datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental design, including any datasets collected during the study. I will look for specific mentions of data collection methods, sample sizes, and any datasets that were analyzed.

In the **results section**, I will identify any datasets that are presented in tables or figures. This section often summarizes the findings and may include statistical analyses based on the datasets collected.

Finally, I will review the **discussion section** to see if the authors reference any datasets in relation to their findings or compare their results with previous studies. This may provide additional context or citations for the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. It is crucial to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to soil microbial communities, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If they used a specific dataset from another study, I will ensure to include that citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
