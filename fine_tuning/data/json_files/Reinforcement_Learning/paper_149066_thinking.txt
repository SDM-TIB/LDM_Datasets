To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HASCO: Towards Agile HArdware and Software CO-design for Tensor Computation" by Qingcheng Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of tensor computations and the proposed HASCO approach, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the paper includes any tables or figures that summarize datasets or experimental results, I will analyze those as well, as they may provide additional insights into the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. This will involve formatting the dataset names, descriptions, and citations clearly and accurately.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is coherent and ready for presentation or further analysis, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in documenting the datasets used in the research.
