To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flipping the Switch on Local Exploration: Genetic Algorithms with Reversals" by Ankit Grover et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of problem domains and the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they describe the flight scheduling problem.

In **section 2.1 (Literature Review)**, the authors mention a dataset related to flight scheduling, specifically stating that "the fliscopt approach utilizes a dataset of schedules consisting of features such as flight cost in dollars, departure, arrival times, city of origin, destination." However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not provide a specific citation for the flight scheduling dataset mentioned earlier.

In **section 4 (Results)**, the authors present results based on their experiments but again do not specify any additional datasets. They refer to benchmark functions used for evaluation, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense.

Since the paper primarily discusses the methodology and results of their approach without naming specific datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Flight Scheduling Dataset**: While the authors describe a dataset related to flight scheduling, they do not provide a formal citation or detailed reference for it. The dataset includes features such as flight cost, departure and arrival times, and city names.

Given the lack of formal citations for the datasets mentioned, I will note that the primary dataset referenced is the flight scheduling dataset used in their experiments, but it lacks a specific citation.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight the absence of formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
