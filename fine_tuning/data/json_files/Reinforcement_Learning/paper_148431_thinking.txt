To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Q-Learning/Genetic Algorithms Based Novel Methodology for Optimizing COVID-19 Pandemic Government Actions" by Luis Miralles-Pechu√°n et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a SEIR epidemiological model and mentions that the methodology is validated through experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or sources of data used in their experiments. The introduction discusses the impact of COVID-19 and the need for data-driven decision-making, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any mention of data sources or datasets used to implement the SEIR model or to validate the proposed methodology. The authors may describe how they collected or simulated data for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any details about the data used in the experiments. The authors may describe the parameters of the SEIR model and how they were derived from real-world data, which could indicate the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that provide full details about the datasets. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will extract the following information for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., size, type of data).
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references section.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
