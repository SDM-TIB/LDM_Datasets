To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis-oriented Medical Image Compression with Efficient Transfer Learning" by Guangqi Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of collecting medical data for compression systems, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the study. However, it does not specify any dataset names.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors mention the dataset used for validation. They state that they collected the dataset from the **imageCAS task**, which is specifically designed for coronary artery segmentation. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the dataset, including how it is organized and the division of samples into training, validation, and test sets. They mention that the dataset is organized in a video format, which is relevant for their compression approach.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the imageCAS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **imageCAS Dataset**:
  > A. Zeng, C. Wu, M. Huang, J. Zhuang, S. Bi, D. Pan, N. Ullah, K. N. Khan, T. Wang, Y. Shi et al., “ImageCAS: A large-scale dataset and benchmark for coronary artery segmentation based on computed tomography angiography images,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01607, 2022.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **imageCAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for the image coronary artery segmentation task and is organized in a video format for compression purposes. The authors collected this dataset specifically for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and accuracy.
