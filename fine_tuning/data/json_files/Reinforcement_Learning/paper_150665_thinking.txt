To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning Properly Resolved?" by Ruiwen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in Section 6, where they outline the environments used for testing their proposed algorithm, Trajectory Q-Learning (TQL). I will pay close attention to any specific datasets or environments mentioned.

In Section 6.1, the authors describe two environments: 

1. **Discrete Mini-Grid Task**: This is a custom-designed environment for evaluating the performance of the TQL algorithm in a discrete action space. The specifics of the dataset or environment setup are provided, including the layout and reward structure.

2. **Continuous Mountain-Car Environment**: This is another custom environment modified to include risky penalties, which is used to evaluate the TQL algorithm in a continuous action space.

Since these environments are not traditional datasets but rather experimental setups, I will note them as such. However, I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or benchmarks are cited that relate to the environments used.

After identifying the environments, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for any referenced works that describe the datasets or environments. For instance, if the authors reference foundational works or datasets in their experiments, I will include those citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset or environment is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
