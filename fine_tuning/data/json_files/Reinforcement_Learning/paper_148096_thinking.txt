To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Trust Region Policy Optimization: Global Convergence and Faster Rates for Regularized MDPs" by Lior Shani, Yonathan Efroni, and Shie Mannor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of reinforcement learning (RL) and mention various algorithms but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** and **experiments sections** to look for any datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation methods and mention that they conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets. They specifically refer to the **OpenAI Gym** and **Atari games** as environments for their experiments. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Atari Games**:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.0576.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Atari Games**: A set of games used as benchmarks for evaluating RL algorithms.

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset in the final output.
