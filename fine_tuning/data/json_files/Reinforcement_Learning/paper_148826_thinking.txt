To extract datasets from the research paper titled "myGym: Modular Toolkit for Visuomotor Robotic Tasks" by Michal Vavrecka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the toolkit's capabilities but does not specify any datasets. The introduction emphasizes the need for training data in robotics but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to identify any references to datasets used in previous studies or toolkits. This section discusses various existing frameworks but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **toolkit structure and configuration sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets that can be generated or used within the myGym framework. The paper mentions that users can generate training datasets by configuring the environment, robots, and objects, but it does not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might be indirectly referenced through the cited works. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing frameworks and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors focus on the capabilities of the myGym toolkit rather than providing specific datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets explicitly named in this paper that require citation.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not provide specific datasets or citations, and I will note that the focus is on the toolkit's ability to generate customizable training data rather than on pre-existing datasets.
