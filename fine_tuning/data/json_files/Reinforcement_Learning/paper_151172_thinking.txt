To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control and Renewable Accommodation Using Spatial-Temporal Graph Information" by Jinhao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions validating the proposed strategy on modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. The introduction discusses the challenges of integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) into distribution networks (DNs) and hints at the use of standard datasets for testing the proposed methods. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they validate their method on the modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems. This confirms that these datasets are indeed the ones utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The IEEE bus systems are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the original sources or standard references for these datasets.

1. **IEEE 33-Bus Radial Distribution System**: The citation is:
   > Schneider, K. P., Mather, B. A., Pal, B. C., Ten, C.-W., Shirek, G. J., Zhu, H., Fuller, J. C., Pereira, L. F. O., Ochoa, L. R. de A., Dugan, R. C., Matthias, S., Paudyal, T. E., & Kersting, W. (2018). Analytic considerations and design basis for the IEEE distribution test feeders. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 33(3), 3181-3188.

2. **IEEE 69-Bus Radial Distribution System**: The citation is the same as above since it is part of the same test feeder documentation.

3. **IEEE 118-Bus Radial Distribution System**: The citation is also the same as above for the same reason.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- IEEE 33-Bus Radial Distribution System
- IEEE 69-Bus Radial Distribution System
- IEEE 118-Bus Radial Distribution System

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset as outlined above.
