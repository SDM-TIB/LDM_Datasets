To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Go-Explore for Residential Energy Management" by Junlin Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, while the introduction elaborates on the context and significance of the study. The experiments section is crucial as it typically details the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Electricity Price Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the PJM dataset, covering electricity prices. The training data spans from 01/05/2021 00:00 to 02/05/2021 00:00, and the evaluation data covers the month of May 2021.

2. **Background Load and Renewable Generation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Smart* dataset for Sustainability, specifically from "Home C" of the UMass dataset. The training data covers the period from 01/05/2014 00:00 to 02/05/2014 00:00, with evaluation data spanning from 01/05/2014 00:00 to 31/05/2014 00:00.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PJM dataset**, the citation is:
  > PJM. 2021 PJM dataset. https://dataminer2.pjm.com/feed/rt_fivemin_mnt_lmps (2021), https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations.

- For the **Smart* dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barker, S., Mishra, A., Irwin, D., Cecchet, E., Shenoy, P., Albrecht, J., et al. *Smart*: An open data set and tools for enabling research in sustainable homes. SustKDD, August 111(112), 108 (2012).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
