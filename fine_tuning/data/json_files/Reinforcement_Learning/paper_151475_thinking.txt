To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evolutionary Framework for Connect-4 as Test-Bed for Comparison of Advanced Minimax, Q-Learning and MCTS" by Henry Taylor and Leonardo Stella, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may mention the context of the research and any datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section II (Algorithms)** or any dedicated section on datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss various algorithms and their implementations, but I need to confirm if they reference any datasets used for training or evaluation.

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention using specific datasets for training or testing their algorithms, I will note these down carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I will search for the original sources of the datasets mentioned in the paper using academic databases or search engines.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to reflect the details of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
