To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing Safety Interference for Safe and Comfortable Automated Driving with Distributional Reinforcement Learning" by Danial Kamran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets or simulations used in the research. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and evaluated their approach using a high-level simulator with various randomized scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets or simulation environments involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of applying reinforcement learning in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving but does not specify any datasets directly.

I will then look into the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets or simulation environments used. In this case, the authors mention using a high-level simulator to create randomized scenarios, but they do not provide specific names for any datasets.

To ensure I have not missed any details, I will also check the **results** and **evaluation** sections. Here, the authors describe the training and evaluation of different RL policies, but again, they do not specify any datasets by name.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the references primarily focus on related research and do not provide specific dataset citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **High-Level Simulator**: The authors utilized a high-level simulator to generate various randomized scenarios for training and evaluation. However, no specific dataset name is provided.

2. **Randomized Scenarios**: The scenarios included various configurations of vehicles and environmental conditions, but again, no dataset is explicitly cited.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that while the authors conducted experiments using a simulator, they did not provide formal dataset citations. This is an important observation, as it highlights the need for clarity in research regarding the datasets used for experiments.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, noting the absence of specific dataset citations, and prepare to present this information in a structured format for further review or processing.
