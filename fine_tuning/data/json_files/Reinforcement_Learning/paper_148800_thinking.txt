To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Learning for Beamforming in mmWave MIMO Networks" by Xueyuan Wang and M. Cenk Gursoy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted. The introduction may also reference prior works that could indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their approach and the environment settings, which may include details about the datasets used for training and testing their model.

I will pay particular attention to any references to **simulation environments** or **data generation methods**. For instance, the paper describes the environment setup, including the number of base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs), which suggests that the authors may have used simulated data rather than publicly available datasets.

If the paper mentions any specific datasets or simulation parameters, I will note them down. In this case, the authors refer to using a **channel model** and **user mobility patterns**, which implies that they might have generated their own dataset based on these parameters.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of any datasets or related works that may have provided the data. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each.

For example, if they reference a dataset like the **3GPP standards** for path loss models, I will find the corresponding citation in the references.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include any relevant details such as the number of samples, the type of data (e.g., simulated or real), and the context in which the dataset was used.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing complete citations for each as required.
