To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VCNet: A self-explaining model for realistic counterfactual generation" by Victor Guyomard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed model. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the paper, the authors mention using six binary-classification datasets for comparison with their model. I will list these datasets as follows:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year based on various attributes. 

2. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset contains information about students' academic performance and is used to predict their final grades.

3. **Titanic Dataset**: A well-known dataset used for predicting survival on the Titanic based on passenger characteristics.

4. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the likelihood of default on home equity lines of credit.

5. **OULAD Dataset**: The Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, which contains data on student performance in online courses.

6. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the presence of breast cancer based on various medical attributes.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides some references that can be used to cite the datasets properly. Here are the citations I will include:

- **Adult Dataset**: 
  > R Kohavi and B Becker. *UCI machine learning repository: Adult data set*, 1996.

- **Student Performance Dataset**: 
  > Paulo Cortez and Alice Maria Gonçalves Silva. *Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance*. In Proceedings of Annual Future Business Technology Conference, pages 5–12, 2008.

- **Titanic Dataset**: 
  > Kaggle. *Titanic – machine learning from disaster*. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview, 2018.

- **HELOC Dataset**: 
  > FICO. *Explainable machine learning challenge*. https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge, 2018.

- **OULAD Dataset**: 
  > Jakub Kuzilek, Martin Hlosta, and Zdenek Zdrahal. *Open university learning analytics dataset*. Scientific data, 4:170171, 2017.

- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: 
  > Catherine Blake. *UCI repository of machine learning databases*. http://www.ics.uci.edu/mlearn/MLRepository.html, 1998.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
