To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Investigation Towards Efficient Multi-Domain Language Model Pre-training" by Kristjan Arumae, Qing Sun, and Parminder Bhatia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for in-domain pre-training and mentions using various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **BookCorpus**: A dataset containing a large collection of books used for pre-training language models.
2. **English Wikipedia**: Another widely used dataset for pre-training language models.
3. **CommonCrawl Stories**: A dataset derived from web pages, specifically curated for language modeling tasks.
4. **OpenWebText**: A dataset that mimics the content of the web, used for training language models.
5. **Pubmed**: A dataset consisting of biomedical literature, specifically Pubmed abstracts and articles, used for domain-specific pre-training.
6. **MIMIC-III**: A dataset containing clinical notes used for further fine-tuning in the clinical domain.
7. **BC5CDR**: A biomedical named entity recognition dataset used for evaluation.
8. **Chemprot**: A dataset for chemical-protein relation extraction, also used for evaluation.
9. **BioASQ**: A dataset for biomedical question answering tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
