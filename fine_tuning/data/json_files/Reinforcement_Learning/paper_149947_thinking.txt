To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Associative Memory Based Experience Replay for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Mengyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of experience replay in deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their proposed method on **OpenAI Gym environments**. This indicates that the datasets used for training and testing their models are likely derived from these environments.

I will then look for specific mentions of datasets within the **evaluation section**. The authors refer to environments such as **CartPole, Acrobot, and LunarLander**. These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The OpenAI Gym environments are well-documented, and the citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

Since the environments themselves (CartPole, Acrobot, LunarLander) are part of the OpenAI Gym, they do not have separate citations but are included in the citation for the Gym itself.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **OpenAI Gym - CartPole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.
2. **OpenAI Gym - Acrobot**: A two-link robot arm that must swing up to a certain height.
3. **OpenAI Gym - LunarLander**: A simulation of a lunar lander that must land safely on the moon's surface.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
