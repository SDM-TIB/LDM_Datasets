To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing the Action-Generalization Gap in Deep Q-Learning" by Zhiyuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the action generalization ability of deep Q-learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the importance of generalization in reinforcement learning but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The paper discusses various environments and action spaces, particularly focusing on classic Gym control environments and Atari 2600 games. However, it does not provide specific dataset names in these sections.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention using environments like CartPole, Pendulum, and LunarLander, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are environments for reinforcement learning experiments. The paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets used in their experiments.

Since the paper primarily discusses the action generalization gap in the context of reinforcement learning environments rather than specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract with full citations.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper references several environments, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to document.
