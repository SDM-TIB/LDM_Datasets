To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactuals Modulo Temporal Logics" by Bernd Finkbeiner and Julian Siber, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will have a specific section that details the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically includes the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **related work section**, I will review it as well, as it may reference other studies that used similar datasets or provide context for the datasets used in this research.

Once I identify any datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find a dataset named "XYZ Dataset" mentioned in the paper, I will look for its citation in the References section, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
