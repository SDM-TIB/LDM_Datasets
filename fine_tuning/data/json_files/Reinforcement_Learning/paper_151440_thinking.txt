To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwiftRL: Towards Efficient Reinforcement Learning on Real Processing-In-Memory Systems" by Sai Santosh Dayapule et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) and mentions the use of "experience datasets," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of using pre-collected experience datasets for training RL agents. They mention that these datasets can come from various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They specifically mention using the **Frozen Lake** and **Taxi** environments from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their RL experiments.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about these datasets. The authors mention that they collected 1 million transitions for the Frozen Lake environment and 5 million transitions for the Taxi environment. This provides concrete information about the datasets used.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. The Frozen Lake and Taxi environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, so I will need to cite the relevant paper:

- For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Frozen Lake Environment**: A dataset consisting of 1 million transitions used for training RL agents.
2. **Taxi Environment**: A dataset consisting of 5 million transitions used for training RL agents.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
