To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RansomAI: AI-powered Ransomware for Stealthy Encryption" by Jan von der Assen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of RansomAI and its validation on a ransomware called Ransomware-PoC, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about ransomware but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will examine **section III (Problem Statement & Scenario Description)**, where the authors describe the scenario involving a Raspberry Pi 4 and the Ransomware-PoC. Here, they mention that the Ransomware-PoC is an extended version that includes various configurations for encryption, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Moving on to **section IV (RansomAI Architecture)**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. The section primarily discusses the architecture and components of RansomAI, including the agent and anomaly detector, but does not mention any datasets.

In **section V (Experiments)**, the authors detail the experiments conducted to evaluate RansomAI. They mention using the Ransomware-PoC and the Raspberry Pi 4 as a testing environment, but there is no mention of external datasets used for training or validation.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references include various papers and reports related to cybersecurity and AI, but they do not specifically list datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used in their research. Instead, they focused on the implementation and evaluation of their framework using a specific ransomware sample (Ransomware-PoC) and a Raspberry Pi 4 as the testing platform.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will note that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If any datasets had been mentioned, I would have ensured to provide full citations for each dataset according to the appropriate academic standards.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings and prepare to document that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
