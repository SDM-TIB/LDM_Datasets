To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action needed to make carbon offsets from tropical forest conservation work for climate change mitigation" by Thales A. P. West et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the research. In this section, the authors describe the 27 voluntary REDD+ projects evaluated across six tropical countries. I will look for specific names of datasets or project identifiers that can be used to reference the datasets accurately.

I will also check the **tables and figures** within the paper, particularly **Table S1**, which lists the VCS-certified REDD+ projects, including their IDs, names, and other relevant details. This table is crucial as it provides a comprehensive overview of the projects analyzed in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for ensuring that each dataset is properly credited and can be traced back to its original source.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset or project.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset entails, including the geographical coverage and the type of data it contains.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication details, and any relevant links.

In this case, the datasets I will extract include:
- The list of 27 REDD+ projects, including their names and details from Table S1.
- Any additional datasets mentioned in the methods or results sections that provide context or data used for analysis.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and formatted correctly for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in documenting the datasets from the paper.
