To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Attractor Selection Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Xue-She Wang, James D. Turner, and Brian P. Mann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or experimental setups.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training or testing the models. This section typically provides insights into the experimental design and the data sources.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets in relation to their findings. This can help confirm the datasets used and provide additional context.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the primary dataset used is related to the DufÔ¨Ång oscillator, as it is a key example in the experiments. However, I will verify if any other datasets are mentioned, especially in the context of reinforcement learning applications.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as per the requirements.

Finally, I will organize the extracted datasets into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
