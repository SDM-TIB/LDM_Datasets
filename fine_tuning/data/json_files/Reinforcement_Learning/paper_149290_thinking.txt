To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-Based Strategy Design for Robot-Assisted Reminiscence Therapy Based on a Developed Model for People with Dementia" by Fengpei Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets or sources of data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics, such as size, type, and source.

If the paper includes an **appendix** or **supplementary materials**, I will check these sections as well, as they often contain additional details about datasets that are not included in the main text.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. This includes the purpose of the dataset, the number of samples, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After gathering the necessary information about each dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the paper, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced the dataset to ensure I provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents the findings. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
