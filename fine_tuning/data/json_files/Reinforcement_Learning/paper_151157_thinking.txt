To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Back-stepping Experience Replay with Application to Model-free Reinforcement Learning for a Soft Snake Robot" by Xinda Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), where the authors describe the application of their proposed method. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to prior works that may indicate the datasets utilized.

In the paper, the authors mention a **dynamic simulator** developed for the soft snake robot, and they refer to previous works that may have datasets associated with them. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments, especially in the context of the locomotion and navigation tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to retrieve the complete citation for those studies.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Soft Snake Robot Simulator Dataset**: This dataset is implied through the experiments conducted in the dynamic simulator. However, it may not have a formal citation since it is likely a product of the authors' own simulations.

2. **Prior Works Datasets**: The authors reference previous studies that may have datasets relevant to soft robotics and reinforcement learning. I will extract the citations for these studies to provide context for the datasets used.

For the citations, I will ensure to format them correctly, including all authors, title, publication venue, and year. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their origins.
