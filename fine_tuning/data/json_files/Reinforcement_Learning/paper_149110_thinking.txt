To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibrating Over-Parametrized Simulation Models: A Framework via Eligibility Set" by Yuanlu Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for calibration or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or simulation environments that are critical to their research. This section often sets the context for the study and may highlight important datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the characteristics of the datasets, such as their size, structure, and the specific parameters they are calibrated against. This section is crucial for understanding how the datasets are utilized in the research.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their calibration methods on specific datasets. They may provide insights into how well their methods performed on different datasets, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be relevant:

1. **ABIDES (Agent-Based Interactive Discrete-Event Simulation Environment)**: This dataset is likely used for simulating market dynamics and may be referenced multiple times throughout the paper. I will look for the specific citation for this dataset.

2. **Synthetic datasets** generated from the simulations described in the paper. The authors may have created specific configurations for their experiments, and I will need to document these configurations as datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
