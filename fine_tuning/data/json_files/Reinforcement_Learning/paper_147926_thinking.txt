To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DQN with Model-Based Exploration: Efficient Learning on Environments with Sparse Rewards" by Stephen Gou and Yuyang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their agent's performance in two classic environments with sparse rewards in OpenAI Gym, specifically **Mountain Car** and **Lunar Lander**. This indicates that these environments are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation of the proposed algorithm. They explicitly state that they tested their algorithm on the **Mountain Car** and **Lunar Lander** environments, confirming that these are indeed the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The authors reference OpenAI Gym, which provides implementations of these environments. Therefore, I will cite the OpenAI Gym paper as the source for both datasets:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. OpenAI Gym, 2016.

Since both environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, this single citation will suffice for both datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. The datasets are:

1. **Mountain Car**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.
2. **Lunar Lander**: Another classic environment where the objective is to land a spacecraft on the moon.

Both datasets are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, and I will ensure to include the citation for OpenAI Gym in the final output.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is complete with the necessary details and citations.
