To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TIME-MYOPIC GO-EXPLORE: LEARNING A STATE REPRESENTATION FOR THE GO-EXPLORE PARADIGM" by Marc HÃ¶ftmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on hard exploration environments, specifically naming **MontezumaRevenge**, **Gravitar**, and **Frostbite** as the environments used for validation. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that their method is evaluated on the environments **Montezuma's Revenge**, **Gravitar**, and **Frostbite**. I will note these down as the datasets of interest.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since these environments are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, I will look for their original papers or sources:

1. **Montezuma's Revenge**: This game is a classic Atari game often used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for the original game can be attributed to:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06730.

2. **Gravitar**: Similar to Montezuma's Revenge, this is another Atari game. The citation can be referenced from the same source as above, as it is part of the Atari suite:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06730.

3. **Frostbite**: This game is also included in the Atari suite. The citation remains the same:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06730.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
