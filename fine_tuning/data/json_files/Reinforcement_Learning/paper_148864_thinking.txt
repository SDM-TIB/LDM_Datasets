To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Volumetric Segmentation of Additive Manufacturing Defects with 3D U-Net" by Vivian Wen Hui Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and tested their model on an AM dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of four cylindrical AM specimens, and they reference previous work by Kim et al. (2017) and Kim et al. (2019) regarding the dataset's introduction and availability.

In this section, I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **AM Defect Dataset**: This dataset includes XCT images of four cylindrical AM specimens, which were analyzed for defects caused by unoptimized AM processing parameters. The authors specify that the dataset is publicly available.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of the works referenced in section 4.1. The relevant citations are:

- For the dataset introduced by Kim et al. (2017):
  > Kim, F.H.; Moylan, S.P.; Garboczi, E.J.; Slotwinski, J.A. 2017. *Investigation of Pore Structure in Cobalt Chrome Additively Manufactured Parts Using X-Ray Computed Tomography and Three-Dimensional Image Analysis*. Additive Manufacturing, 17:23-38.

- For the publicly available dataset by Kim et al. (2019):
  > Kim, F.H.; Moylan, S.P.; Garboczi, E.J.; Slotwinski, J.A. 2019. *High-Resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography (XCT) Image Data Set of Additively Manufactured Cobalt Chrome Samples Produced with Varying Laser Powder Bed Fusion Processing Parameters, CoCr AM XCT Data*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, https://doi.org/10.18434/M32162.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and full citation are accurately represented.
