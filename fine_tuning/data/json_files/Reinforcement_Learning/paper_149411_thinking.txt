To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Audio-based Navigation and Audio Source Localization in Multi-speaker Environments" by Petros Giannakopoulos, Aggelos Pikrakis, and Yannis Cotronis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created two virtual environments for their experiments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe how they created datasets from audiobooks. Specifically, they mention that they used 10 publicly available audiobooks, each read by different speakers, and that they processed these audiobooks into utterances using a Voice Activity Detector (VAD). This is a crucial detail as it indicates the source of their dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide information about how they split the dataset into training and testing partitions for their experiments. They mention that for the audio-based navigation environment, they used 5 speakers with approximately 600 utterances each, and for the audio source localization environment, they used all 10 speakers. This confirms the existence of two distinct datasets based on the audiobooks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the audiobooks used, but they do reference their own previous work, which may include details about the audiobooks or the dataset creation process.

The relevant citation for their previous work is:
> Petros Giannakopoulos, Aggelos Pikrakis, and Yannis Cotronis. *A deep reinforcement learning approach to audio-based navigation in a multi-speaker environment*. In ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 3475â€“3479, 2021.

Since the datasets are derived from publicly available audiobooks, I will note that the specific audiobooks are not cited in detail, but the methodology for creating the dataset is described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations and descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
