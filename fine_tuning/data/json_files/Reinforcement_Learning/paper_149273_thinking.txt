To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WAD: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Urban Autonomous Driving" by Arjit Sharma and Sahil Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that this might be a key dataset or environment used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors describe the use of the **CARLA simulator** for training their WAD agent. They specify that they utilize four data points from CARLA: front camera RGB images, waypoints data, traffic light state, and collision sensor data. This indicates that CARLA is indeed a dataset or environment that is central to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors evaluate their agents on the CARLA benchmark and the NoCrash benchmark. This reinforces the importance of the CARLA simulator as a dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator. The relevant citation is:

- For **CARLA**:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio M. LÃ³pez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. ArXiv, abs/1711.03938, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used in their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CARLA, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
