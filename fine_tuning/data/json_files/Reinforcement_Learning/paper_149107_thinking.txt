To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Network selection for the Object Detection task: why it matters and what we (didn’t) achieve" by Emanuele Vitali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions benchmarking different neural networks on the **COCO 17 database**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments and results sections**. In the introduction, the authors refer to the **KITTI dataset** as well, which is used in the context of autonomous driving. This suggests that both COCO and KITTI datasets are significant for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they performed a benchmarking campaign on different object detection models using the **COCO 2017 dataset**. They also mention using the **KITTI dataset** for a specific automotive use case. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Bourdev, L., Girshick, R., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Zitnick, C.L., Dollár, P. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Urtasun, R. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

- **COCO 2017 dataset**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, widely used in computer vision research.
- **KITTI dataset**: A dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving tasks, providing various benchmarks for object detection and tracking.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
