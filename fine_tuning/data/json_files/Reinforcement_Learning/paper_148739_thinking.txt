To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Assignment Problem" by Filipp Skomorokhov and George Ovchinnikov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract does not mention any specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of user scheduling problems but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where they describe their simulator setup.

In **section 3 (Experiments description)**, the authors mention using a simulator with 1 transmitter and 10 users, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. They describe the simulation parameters and the goal of minimizing penalties, but again, no datasets are explicitly named.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments. The results primarily focus on the performance of the agents and comparisons with the baseline algorithm, without mentioning specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The authors focus on a simulation environment rather than a publicly available dataset.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize my findings:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned or used in the experiments.**
2. **The experiments were conducted using a custom simulator rather than established datasets.**

This concludes my extraction process for this paper. I will document that no datasets were found in the specified format.
