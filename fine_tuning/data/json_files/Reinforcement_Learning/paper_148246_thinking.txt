To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLM Lab: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Modular Software Framework for Reproducible Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Wah Loon Keng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its capabilities, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of reproducibility in reinforcement learning but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments conducted. In **section 3**, the authors mention that they tested their algorithms on **77 environments**, which include **62 Atari games** and **11 Roboschool environments**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for specific references to these environments in the text. The paper lists the environments in **Table 1** and **Table 2**, which detail the performance of various algorithms across different Atari and Roboschool environments. 

For the Atari environments, the paper mentions:
- **Atari Games**: A list of 62 games is provided, including titles like "Breakout," "Pong," and "Seaquest." Each game serves as a dataset for evaluating the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithms.

For the Roboschool environments, the paper mentions:
- **Roboschool Environments**: A list of 11 environments is provided, including "RoboschoolAnt," "RoboschoolHalfCheetah," and "RoboschoolHumanoid." These environments are also used as datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the environments are part of established libraries (OpenAI Gym and Roboschool), I will cite the original sources for these libraries instead:

1. For the **Atari environments**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR, abs/1606.01540, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

2. For the **Roboschool environments**, the citation is:
   > Arthur Juliani, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Esh Vckay, Yuan Gao, Hunter Henry, Marwan Mattar, and Danny Lange. *Unity: A general platform for intelligent agents*. CoRR, abs/1809.02627, 2018. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02627.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **Atari Games**: A collection of 62 games used for benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Roboschool Environments**: A collection of 11 environments used for benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for clarity and completeness.
