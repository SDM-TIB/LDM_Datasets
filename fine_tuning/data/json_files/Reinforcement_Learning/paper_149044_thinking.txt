To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Screening of Diseased Eyes based on Fundus Autofluorescence Images using Support Vector Machine" by Shanmukh Reddy Manne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly subsection 2.1, where the authors describe the **fundus autofluorescence image acquisition** process. Here, they mention that the study involved a total of 140 subjects, with 61 healthy eyes and 79 diseased eyes. This indicates that the dataset consists of FAF images from these subjects.

I will also look for any specific names or references to existing datasets in the **Results** and **Discussion** sections. The authors may compare their findings with previous studies or datasets, which could provide additional context or citations.

In the **Acknowledgements** section, the authors mention support from various organizations, but I will focus on the datasets themselves rather than funding sources.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **FAF Images Dataset**: This dataset consists of FAF images acquired from 140 subjects, including 61 healthy eyes and 79 diseased eyes. The specific diseases mentioned include central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM), and Stargardt disease (STGD).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset in this study is primarily derived from the authors' own collection of FAF images, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The relevant citation for the study itself is:
> Shanmukh Reddy Manne, Kiran Kumar Vupparaboinab, Gowtham Chowdary Gudapatia, Ram Anudeep Peddojua, Chandra Prakash Konkimallaa, Abhilash Goudc, Sarforaz Bin Basharc, Jay Chhablanib, Soumya Jana. *Efficient Screening of Diseased Eyes based on Fundus Autofluorescence Images using Support Vector Machine*. Preprint submitted to Elsevier.

In summary, I will document the dataset details and the citation for the paper, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary information for future reference or processing.
