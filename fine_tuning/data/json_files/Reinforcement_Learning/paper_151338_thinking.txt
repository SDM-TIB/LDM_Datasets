To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TDIP: Tunable Deep Image Processing, a Real Time Melt Pool Monitoring Solution" by Javid Akhavan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for training or testing the models. In this paper, the authors mention a "database of real-time co-axial observations along with their cross-cut results published open access in [25]." This indicates that there is a specific dataset referenced, which I need to identify.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The reference [25] is crucial, as it likely contains the details of the dataset used in the study. I will locate this reference and extract the full citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the dataset is cited as follows:
> J. Akhavan, J. Lyu, Y. Mahmoud, K. Xu, C. Krishna Prasad Vallabh, and S. Manoochehri. "Real time coaxial monitoring and print cross-section’s image dataset of Direct Energy Deposition fabrication," Sci Data, Jan. 2023, doi: https://www.scidb.cn/en/s/FzuQF3.

Now, I have identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Real time coaxial monitoring and print cross-section’s image dataset of Direct Energy Deposition fabrication.
   - **Description**: This dataset contains data of various single track DED prints fabricated with various process parameters, including co-axial images recorded in real-time and post-processed cross-sectional images.
   - **Citation**: J. Akhavan, J. Lyu, Y. Mahmoud, K. Xu, C. Krishna Prasad Vallabh, and S. Manoochehri. "Real time coaxial monitoring and print cross-section’s image dataset of Direct Energy Deposition fabrication," Sci Data, Jan. 2023, doi: https://www.scidb.cn/en/s/FzuQF3.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.
