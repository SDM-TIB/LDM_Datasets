To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proof-of-Learning is Currently More Broken Than You Think" by Congyu Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the paper, I will identify any datasets explicitly mentioned, such as "CIFAR-10" and "CIFAR-100," which are commonly used in machine learning research. I will also check if there are any references to other datasets or benchmarks that may be used in their experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original dataset creators.

For example, if the paper mentions "CIFAR-10," I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. The same goes for "CIFAR-100" or any other datasets mentioned.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
