To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Warm-Start AlphaZero Self-Play Search Enhancements" by Hui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses enhancements to AlphaZero-like self-play but does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context on the games used, which could hint at datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Tested Games)**, where the authors describe the games used in their experiments: **Othello**, **Connect Four**, and **Gobang**. While these are not datasets in the traditional sense, they are the environments in which the experiments were conducted. I will need to check if the authors reference any specific datasets or sources for these games.

In **section 6 (Full Length Experiment)**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the 6x6 versions of these games. However, they do not provide any external datasets but rather describe the experimental setup and parameters used for training.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but focuses on the games themselves, I will note that the datasets are essentially the game environments and their configurations. I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational papers or datasets related to these games are cited.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite foundational works related to the games:

1. For **Othello**, the citation is:
   > Shigeki Iwata and Takumi Kasai. "The othello game on an n*n board is pspace-complete." Theoretical Computer Science, 123(2):329–340, 1994.

2. For **Connect Four**, the citation is:
   > L. Victor Allis. "A knowledge-based approach of connect-four." ICGA Journal, 11(4):165, 1988.

3. For **Gobang**, the citation is:
   > Stefan Reisch. "Gobang ist pspace-vollständig." Acta Informatica, 13(1):59–66, 1980.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets (or game environments) and their citations into a structured format for clarity.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it references foundational works related to the games used in the experiments, which can be considered as the basis for the datasets in this context.
