To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Pre-training with Supervised, Autoencoder, and Value Losses for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gabriel V. de la Cruz Jr., Yunshu Du, and Matthew E. Taylor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of non-expert human demonstrations for pre-training, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide context about the data.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide information about the human demonstration data used for pre-training, specifically for the games **MsPacman** and **Pong**. The table includes details such as the number of states, episodes, and scores, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference their previous work, which likely contains the necessary details about the datasets used.

For the **human demonstration dataset**, I will note the following citation:
- For the dataset used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > Gabriel V. de la Cruz Jr., Yunshu Du, and Matthew E. Taylor. *Pre-training with Non-expert Human Demonstration for Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.08904, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
