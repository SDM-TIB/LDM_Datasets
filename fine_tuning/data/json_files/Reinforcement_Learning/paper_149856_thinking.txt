To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Proof-Number Search" by Elliot Doe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments in several games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors describe the experimental setup and the games used for testing. The paper mentions five specific games: **Lines of Action, Awari, MiniShogi, Gomoku, and Knightthrough**. I will note these games as potential datasets.

I will then look for any explicit references to datasets or game descriptions in the **game domains subsection (V-B)**. Each game is briefly described, which may provide insights into the datasets used for the experiments. 

1. **Lines of Action**: The authors describe the rules and structure of the game, indicating that it has been extensively tested with MCTS and PNS. However, no specific dataset citation is provided.

2. **Awari**: The description of this Mancala game also lacks a specific dataset citation, but it indicates that it has been used as a testbed for PNS and MCTS.

3. **MiniShogi**: Similar to the previous games, the authors provide a description but do not cite a specific dataset.

4. **Gomoku**: The authors mention that PNS has been applied to Gomoku, but again, no dataset citation is provided.

5. **Knightthrough**: The description indicates its use in testing MCTS, but no dataset citation is mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations for these games, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find authoritative sources for each game. 

- For **Lines of Action**, I will look for papers or resources that describe the game and its implementations in the context of MCTS or PNS.
- For **Awari**, I will search for academic references that detail the game and its use in research.
- For **MiniShogi**, I will find relevant literature that discusses the game and its applications in AI research.
- For **Gomoku**, I will look for studies that have utilized this game in similar contexts.
- For **Knightthrough**, I will identify any relevant papers that have explored this game in the context of MCTS or PNS.

After gathering the necessary citations, I will compile them into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have captured all relevant datasets and their citations, ready for downstream processing or review.
