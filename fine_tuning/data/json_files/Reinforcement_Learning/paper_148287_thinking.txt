To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Wasserstein Constrained Deep Q-Learning" by Aaron Kandel and Scott J. Moura, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss a case study involving lithium-ion battery fast charging, which may imply the use of specific datasets related to battery performance or simulations.

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithm. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their characteristics, size, and relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Single Particle Model with Electrolyte & Thermal Dynamics," I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for presentation or further analysis.
