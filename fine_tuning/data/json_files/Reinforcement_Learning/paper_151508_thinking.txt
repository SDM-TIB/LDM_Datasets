To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Agnostic Learning of Mixed Linear Regressions with EM and AM Algorithms" by Avishek Ghosh and Arya Mazumdar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that detail the experimental setup, as they usually describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. If the authors refer to datasets without providing full citations, I will check the **References section** to find the original sources for these datasets.

For each identified dataset, I will ensure to extract the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or common name used in the research.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, features, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the necessary details and citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will double-check the citations for accuracy and completeness, as proper referencing is crucial for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.
