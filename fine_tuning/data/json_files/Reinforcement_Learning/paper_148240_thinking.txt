To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations for Q-Learning in Continuous Time" by Jeongho Kim and Insoon Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors might describe the experiments and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will note down any dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details provided by the authors.

In this paper, the authors discuss numerical experiments involving 1-, 10-, and 20-dimensional dynamical systems. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or benchmarks. Instead, they describe the parameters and configurations used for their simulations, which are generated rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any relevant works that might have datasets associated with them. However, it appears that the references mainly consist of foundational papers and methodologies rather than datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to gather full citations for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, to maintain proper attribution.

In summary, I will document my findings, noting that while the paper discusses numerical experiments, it does not reference any specific datasets. If datasets had been mentioned, I would have compiled their details and citations accordingly.
