To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dual-Critic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Frame-level Bit Allocation in HEVC/H.265" by Yung-Han Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experimental results were obtained from "commonly used datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors mention their training datasets: **UVG**, **MCL-JCV**, and **Class A sequences in the JCT-VC dataset**. This section is crucial as it provides the context in which these datasets were used.

I will then look for a **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this case, the datasets are explicitly listed in the experimental results, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **UVG Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mercat, Alexandre et al., “UVG dataset: 50/120fps 4k sequences for video codec analysis and development,” in Proceedings of the 11th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, 2020.

2. **MCL-JCV Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wang, H. et al., “MCL-JCV: A jnd-based H.264/AVC video quality assessment dataset,” in 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2016, pp. 1509–1513.

3. **JCT-VC Dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is commonly known in the field. The original reference for the JCT-VC dataset is:
   > "Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC)," available at: https://jctvc.org.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
