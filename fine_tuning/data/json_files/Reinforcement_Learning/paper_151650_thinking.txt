To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn to Memorize and to Forget: A Continual Learning Perspective of Dynamic SLAM" by Baicheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on "challenging datasets," which suggests that specific datasets are used, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention evaluating their method on multiple sequences of the **TUM RGB-D dataset** and the **Bonn RGB-D dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for these datasets. The TUM RGB-D dataset is cited as follows:
- > Sturm, J., Engelhard, N., Endres, F., Burgard, W., & Cremers, D. (2012). *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS).

The Bonn RGB-D dataset is cited as:
- > Palazzolo, E., Behley, J., Lottes, P., Gigu√®re, P., & Stachniss, C. (2019). *ReFusion: 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Environments for RGB-D Cameras Exploiting Residuals*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for downstream processing.
