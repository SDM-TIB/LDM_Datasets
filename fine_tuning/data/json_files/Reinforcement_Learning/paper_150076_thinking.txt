To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations" by Marie Siew et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain comprehensive information about each dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific attributes that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" in their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references that provides the complete details of that dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key features.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that it is ready for any required output format or further processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
