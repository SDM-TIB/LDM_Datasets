To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Decision Transformer for Offline Hindsight Information Matching" by Hiroki Furuta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets from the **D4RL** (Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning) benchmark, specifically for the MuJoCo continuous control tasks. They also refer to the **OpenAI Gym** as a platform for their experiments.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **D4RL Medium-Expert Datasets**: These datasets are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods on various continuous control tasks. The authors mention using medium-expert datasets for HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d environments.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The authors utilize this platform for their experiments, although it is not a dataset in itself.

Next, I will look for full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The D4RL datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For D4RL:
  > Fu, J., Gupta, A., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

- For OpenAI Gym:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is documented clearly and accurately for future reference or analysis.
