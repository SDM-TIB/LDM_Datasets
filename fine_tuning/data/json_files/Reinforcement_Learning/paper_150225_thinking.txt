To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effectiveness of World Models for Continual Reinforcement Learning" by Samuel Kessler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **Minigrid and Minihack benchmarks**, which suggests that these may be datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using **Minigrid** and **Minihack** as benchmarks for their evaluations. I will need to confirm whether these are indeed datasets or environments and gather more details about them.

In **section 5.1 (Minigrid)**, the authors specify that they tested their method on three specific tasks from the Minigrid environment: **DoorKey-9x9**, **SimpleCrossing-SN9**, and **LavaCrossing-9x9**. This indicates that these tasks are part of the Minigrid benchmark, which is a dataset of environments for reinforcement learning.

In **section 5.2 (Minihack)**, the authors describe their experiments on four tasks from the Minihack environment: **Room-Random-15x15-v0**, **Room-Trap-15x15-v0**, **River-Narrow-v0**, and **River-Monster-v0**. This confirms that Minihack is also a benchmark used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The citations for the Minigrid and Minihack environments are as follows:

- For **Minigrid**, the citation is:
  > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

- For **Minihack**, the citation is:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Robert Kirk, Vitaly Kurin, Jack Parker-Holder, Minqi Jiang, Eric Hambro, Fabio Petroni, Heinrich Kuttler, Edward Grefenstette, and Tim Rockt√§schel. *Minihack the planet: A sandbox for open-ended reinforcement learning research*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 1), 2021. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=skFwlyefkWJ.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset in the required format.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper as follows:
1. **Minigrid**: A benchmark environment for reinforcement learning with various tasks.
   - Citation: Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

2. **Minihack**: A set of diverse, image-based, and sparse reward tasks based on the game of Nethack.
   - Citation: Mikayel Samvelyan et al. *Minihack the planet: A sandbox for open-ended reinforcement learning research*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 1), 2021. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=skFwlyefkWJ.

Now, I will prepare the final structured output for these datasets.
