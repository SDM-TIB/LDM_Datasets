To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Option Discovery using Deep Q-Learning and Variational Autoencoders" by Per-Arne Andersen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the DVQN algorithm and its application to classic RL problems from the OpenAI gym, which suggests that datasets from the OpenAI gym may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). Here, the authors describe the environments used for testing the DVQN algorithm. They mention four environments: **CartPole-v0**, **Acrobot-v1**, **CrossingS9N3-v0**, and **FourRooms-v0**. Each of these environments is part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known collection of environments for reinforcement learning.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The environments are derived from the following sources:

1. **CartPole-v0** and **Acrobot-v1**: These environments originate from the OpenAI Gym, which is cited as:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arxiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (jun 2016). [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540)

2. **CrossingS9N3-v0** and **FourRooms-v0**: These environments are mentioned to originate from a GitHub repository:
   > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., Pal, S. "Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym." [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) (2018)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **CartPole-v0**: 
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arxiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (jun 2016).

2. **Acrobot-v1**: 
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arxiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (jun 2016).

3. **CrossingS9N3-v0**: 
   - Citation: Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., Pal, S. "Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym." [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) (2018).

4. **FourRooms-v0**: 
   - Citation: Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., Pal, S. "Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym." [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) (2018).

Finally, I will ensure that all this information is organized and ready for any further processing or review.
