To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Evolutionary Optimization Approach for Oilfield Well Control Optimization" by Ajitabh Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper demonstrates the application of hybrid evolutionary optimization approaches using the **Olympus benchmark**. This suggests that the Olympus benchmark is a dataset or model used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any further details about datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of oilfield production optimization and mentions the use of reservoir simulation studies, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **approach** section, where the authors describe the Olympus benchmark case as a synthetic simulation model based on a typical North Sea offshore oilfield. This section confirms that the Olympus benchmark is indeed a dataset used for the optimization studies.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the performance of the optimization algorithms on the Olympus benchmark, reinforcing its role as the primary dataset for their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **references** section to find the full citation for the Olympus benchmark. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Olympus benchmark itself, but it does reference a related work that discusses the benchmark:

- For the Olympus benchmark, the citation is:
  > Fonseca, R.M., Rossa, E.D., Emerick, A.A., Hanea, R.G. & Jansen, J.D. (2020) Introduction to the special issue: overview of OLYMPUS optimization benchmark challenge. *Computational Geosciences*, 24(6):1933-1941.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted from this paper is the Olympus benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the context of the research.
