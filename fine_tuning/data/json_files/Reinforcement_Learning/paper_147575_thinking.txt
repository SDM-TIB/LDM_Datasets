To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The QLBS Q-Learner Goes NuQLear: Fitted Q Iteration, Inverse RL, and Option Portfolios" by Igor Halperin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the QLBS model and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the QLBS model and its relation to reinforcement learning and option pricing. While it provides context, it does not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

In **section 4 (NuQLear experiments)**, the author describes the experimental setup and mentions using simulated stock price histories. The specific dataset used for the experiments is referred to as "simulated stock price histories St" with parameters such as initial stock price, drift, volatility, and option maturity. However, this is a generated dataset rather than a publicly available one.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if any external datasets are mentioned. The references primarily consist of papers and articles that discuss the theoretical background and methodologies used in the paper, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for any datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Simulated Stock Price Histories**: The paper uses a dataset of simulated stock price histories for its experiments, but it does not provide a formal citation or reference for this dataset as it is generated for the purpose of the study.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of datasets in the context of experiments, it does not provide specific datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset referenced is a simulated dataset created for the experiments, and no external datasets are cited in the paper.
