To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Multivariate Bandit Algorithm with Path Planning" by Keyu Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "real data and simulation studies," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors discuss their empirical validation. They mention using "two validation datasets" from eBay A/B testing experiments and a publicly available dataset on the LIBSVM website. This indicates that there are at least two datasets that I need to extract.

In **Table II**, the authors provide characteristics of the datasets used for validation:

1. **eBay A/B Testing Data**: This dataset has 863 samples and 88 features. It is sourced from eBay's internal A/B testing experiments.

2. **Four-Class Dataset**: This dataset is publicly available on the LIBSVM website and has 4 classes, with a total of 16 samples (4 × 4) and 6 features (2 × 3 × 4).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it does mention that the four-class dataset is available on the LIBSVM website. I will note that the eBay dataset is proprietary and may not have a formal citation.

For the **four-class dataset**, I can reference the LIBSVM website as follows:
> Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. Available at: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.

Since the eBay dataset is not publicly available, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the LIBSVM dataset and noting the proprietary nature of the eBay dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
