To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy management of multi-mode plug-in hybrid electric vehicle using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning" by Min Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of data sources or datasets used for testing or validation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any explicit mentions of datasets. This section often outlines the context and background of the research, which may include references to existing datasets relevant to the study.

I will then focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the data used for their analysis. I will look for specific datasets mentioned in relation to the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework and the energy management strategies being evaluated.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional details about the datasets, such as their characteristics, size, or how they were utilized in the experiments. This section may also provide insights into the performance metrics derived from the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the "UDDS driving cycle," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
