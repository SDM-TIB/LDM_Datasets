To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Intelligent Recommendation-cum-Reminder System" by Rohan Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the need for intelligent reminder systems but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Proposed System)**, where the authors describe the architecture and components of their system. In this section, they mention the use of a **fashion dataset** for training the Stand-Alone Self-Attention model. The relevant details are as follows:

1. **Fashion Dataset**: The authors state that the Stand-Alone Self-Attention model is trained on 7,000 images from 10 categories, and after applying data augmentation techniques, the total number of images increases to 14,000. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the text.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the original source of the fashion dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is available on Kaggle, which is a common platform for datasets. The citation for the dataset is:

- **Fashion Product Images Dataset**: 
  > Param Aggarwal. *Fashion Product Images Dataset*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.3.1, the authors describe the evaluation of their object extraction pipeline, but they do not mention any additional datasets beyond the fashion dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **Fashion Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains 14,000 images after augmentation, used for training the Stand-Alone Self-Attention model.
   - Citation: Param Aggarwal. *Fashion Product Images Dataset*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for the dataset in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as specified.
