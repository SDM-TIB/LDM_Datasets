To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Friends in the Dark: Ad Hoc Teamwork Under Partial Observability" by Jo√£o G. Ribeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an empirical evaluation using **70 POMDPs from 11 domains**, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using a total of **70 POMDPs from 11 different domains**. I will look for a detailed description of these domains to identify them as datasets.

In the **domain descriptions section**, the authors provide specific information about each of the 11 domains used for evaluation. I will extract the names and relevant details of these domains as datasets:

1. **Gridworld**: A multi-agent navigation problem where agents must reach static destinations.
2. **Pursuit**: A modified domain where agents must capture a moving prey.
3. **Abandoned Power Plant**: A scenario where a robot and a human cooperate to secure an abandoned facility.
4. **NTU**: A navigation task in a close quarters environment.
5. **ISR**: Similar to NTU, with different map layouts.
6. **MIT**: Another navigation task with unique characteristics.
7. **Pentagon**: A navigation task with specific challenges.
8. **CIT**: Similar to the other navigation tasks but with its own layout.
9. **Overcooked**: A cooperative cooking scenario where agents must work together to prepare meals.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or references to datasets that may not have been included in the main text.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for full citations in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct and complete references for each dataset. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will cite those original papers.

For example, if the **Pursuit** domain is based on a previous work, I will find the corresponding citation. If the **Overcooked** domain is based on a specific game or simulation framework, I will document that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
