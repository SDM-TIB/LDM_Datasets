To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Bilevel Optimization in Autonomous Driving" by Zhi Zheng and Shangding Gu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a "safe MARL autonomous driving benchmark," which suggests that there may be specific datasets associated with this benchmark. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors refer to "safe MARL autonomous driving benchmarks" and detail various scenarios such as merges, roundabouts, intersections, and racetracks. I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks that are used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention that the benchmarks are based on the **highway-env environments** developed by Edouard Leurent. This indicates that the highway-env dataset is a key component of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the highway-env dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Edouard Leurent. An environment for autonomous driving decision-making. https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env, 2018.

Since the authors also mention that they developed their own safe MARL autonomous driving benchmarks, I will note that while they do not provide a specific citation for these benchmarks, they are derived from the highway-env environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the highway-env dataset. The extracted dataset entry will be ready for further processing or review.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Identify the highway-env dataset as a primary dataset.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the highway-env dataset from the references.
5. Prepare the dataset information for structured output.
