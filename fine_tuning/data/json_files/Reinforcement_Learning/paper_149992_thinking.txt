To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Modeling of Domain and Relevance for Adaptable Dense Retrieval" by Jingtao Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is used for English training data and contains 0.5 million training queries and 8.8 million passages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Craswell, N., Mitra, B., Yilmaz, E., Campos, D. F., & Lin, J. (2021). MS MARCO: Benchmarking Ranking Models in the Large-Data Regime. *Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*.

2. **Dureader**: This dataset serves as the Chinese training data and is transformed into a retrieval dataset. The citation is:
   > He, W., Liu, K., Liu, J., Lyu, Y., Zhao, S., Xiao, X., ... & Wang, Y. (2017). Dureader: A Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset from Real-World Applications. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05073*.

3. **TREC-Covid**: This dataset is used for evaluating retrieval performance related to COVID-19 information. The citation is:
   > Voorhees, E., Alam, T., Bedrick, S., Demner-Fushman, D., Hersh, W. R., Lo, K., ... & Wang, L. (2021). TREC-COVID: Constructing a Pandemic Information Retrieval Test Collection. *ACM SIGIR Forum*.

4. **Lotte benchmark**: This dataset collects questions and answers from StackExchange and is divided into several topics. The citation is:
   > Santhanam, K., Khattab, O., Saad-Falcon, J., Potts, C., & Zaharia, M. (2021). ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction. *NAACL*.

5. **CPR benchmark**: This dataset consists of domain-specific retrieval datasets collected from an e-commerce platform, a video platform, and medical search. The citation is:
   > Long, D., Gao, Q., Zou, K., Xu, G., Xie, P., Guo, R., ... & Yang, P. (2022). Multi-CPR: A Multi Domain Chinese Dataset for Passage Retrieval. (2022).

6. **cMedQAv2**: This dataset is constructed based on a Chinese medical question-answering forum. The citation is:
   > Zhang, S., Zhang, X., Wang, H., Guo, L., & Liu, S. (2018). Multi-scale Attentive Interaction Networks for Chinese Medical Question Answer Selection. *IEEE Access*.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted their descriptions and any relevant statistics provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation as required.
