To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actor-Director-Critic: A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework" by Zongwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed framework and mentions experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment, which suggests that datasets related to these experiments may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4). Here, the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. They mention conducting experiments in **six experimental environments in MuJoCo**, which indicates that these environments may have associated datasets or configurations that are relevant for understanding the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors list the specific environments used for their experiments, which include:

1. **InvertedDoublePendulum**
2. **HalfCheetah**
3. **Humanoid**
4. **Ant**
5. **Walker2d**
6. **Hopper**

I will note that while these environments are mentioned, the paper does not provide specific datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or tabular data). Instead, the datasets here refer to the configurations and reward structures inherent to the MuJoCo environments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the MuJoCo environments or any other datasets that may have been referenced in the context of the experiments. The paper cites the original TD3 algorithm, which is relevant to the experiments conducted, but it does not provide specific dataset citations for the MuJoCo environments.

The relevant citation for the TD3 algorithm, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments, is:
> Scott Fujimoto, Herke Hoof, and David Meger. *Addressing function approximation error in actor-critic methods*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 1587â€“1596. PMLR, 2018.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any additional datasets beyond the MuJoCo environments, I will summarize my findings:

1. **MuJoCo Environments**: The datasets are implicitly defined by the configurations of the environments used in the experiments, which include InvertedDoublePendulum, HalfCheetah, Humanoid, Ant, Walker2d, and Hopper. However, no specific dataset citations are provided for these environments.

2. **TD3 Algorithm Citation**: The citation for the TD3 algorithm is essential for understanding the context of the experiments and is provided above.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details and citations.
