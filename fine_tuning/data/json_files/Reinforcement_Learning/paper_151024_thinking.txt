To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-based Stateful Neural Adaptive Sampling and Denoising for Real-Time Path Tracing" by Antoine Scardigli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several challenging datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 3.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using four specific 3D scenes:

1. **Emerald Square**: This scene is part of the Open Research Content Archive (ORCA) and is referenced with a citation.
2. **SunTemple**: Another scene from ORCA, also cited.
3. **Zero-Day**: This scene is similarly part of ORCA and has a citation.
4. **Ripple Dreams**: This scene is mentioned as being released by James Redmond, but I need to check if a citation is provided.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the number of frames extracted from each scene, which confirms their usage in the experiments. The specific frame counts are:

- Emerald: 1400 frames
- Zero-Day: 400 frames
- SunTemple: 1200 frames
- Ripple Dream: 500 frames

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the ORCA scenes are as follows:

- For **Emerald Square**:
  > Nicholas Hull and N. Benty. "Nvidia Emerald Square, Open Research Content Archive (ORCA)." July 2017. http://developer.nvidia.com/orca/nvidia-emerald-square.

- For **SunTemple**:
  > Epic Games. "Unreal Engine Sun Temple, Open Research Content Archive (ORCA)." October 2017. http://developer.nvidia.com/orca/epic-games-sun-temple.

- For **Zero-Day**:
  > Beeple. "Zero-Day, Open Research Content Archive (ORCA)." November 2019. https://developer.nvidia.com/orca/beeple-zero-day.

- For **Ripple Dreams**, since it is mentioned as being released by James Redmond, I will check if a citation is provided in the references. If not, I will note that it lacks a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
