To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals" by Yue Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of instruction manuals for reinforcement learning (RL) in Atari games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Atari Environment and Baselines)**, where the authors mention using the OpenAI Gym Atari environment. This indicates that the datasets involved are likely related to the Atari games themselves.

In this section, the authors state that they downloaded per-game instruction manuals released by the original game developers or Wikipedia. This suggests that the datasets include:

1. **Atari Game Manuals**: These are the instruction manuals for various Atari games, which are used to inform the RL agents about game mechanics and objectives.

The paper does not provide specific names for datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets), but it does reference the use of instruction manuals as a source of information for the RL agents.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the Atari games or the manuals used. However, the paper primarily discusses the use of the manuals without providing specific citations for each game manual.

The relevant citation for the Atari environment is:
- **OpenAI Gym Atari**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Additionally, the authors mention using Wikipedia as a source for game information, but they do not provide a specific citation for the Wikipedia pages used.

In summary, the key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Atari Game Manuals** (general reference to the manuals used for various games).
2. **OpenAI Gym Atari** (as the environment for the experiments).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
