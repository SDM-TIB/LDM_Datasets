To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning In Two Player Zero Sum Simultaneous Action Games" by Patrick Phillips, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology**, **experiments**, or **results**. In this paper, the **Experiment Methodology** section is crucial as it describes the environments used for testing the algorithms. Here, I will identify any datasets or environments explicitly mentioned.

In the **Experiment Methodology** section, the author describes two environments: 

1. **Iterated Matching Pennies**: This is a simple iterated matrix game where agents repeatedly play against each other. The paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for this game, as it is a well-known theoretical construct in game theory.

2. **Predator-Prey Game**: This environment is described as a gridworld where some agents act as predators and others as prey. Similar to the Matching Pennies game, this is a conceptual environment rather than a dataset with a formal citation.

Since these environments are standard in the field of reinforcement learning and do not have specific datasets associated with them, I will note that they are commonly used benchmarks rather than datasets that require citations.

Next, I will check the **References** section to ensure that I have not missed any datasets that may have been cited in relation to the environments or algorithms discussed. However, in this case, the references primarily discuss algorithms and theoretical concepts rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings. In this paper, there are no formal datasets provided with citations, as the environments discussed (Iterated Matching Pennies and Predator-Prey) are theoretical constructs commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses two environments for testing the algorithms, they do not correspond to specific datasets that require formal citations. Instead, they are established benchmarks in the field of reinforcement learning.
