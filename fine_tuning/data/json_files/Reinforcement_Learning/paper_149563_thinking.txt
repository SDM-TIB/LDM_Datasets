To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Age-of-information minimization via opportunistic sampling by an energy harvesting source" by Akanksha Jaiswal, Arpan Chattopadhyay, and Amokh Varma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were used in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain the most relevant information. I will note down the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "Energy Harvesting Dataset" or "Age of Information Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
