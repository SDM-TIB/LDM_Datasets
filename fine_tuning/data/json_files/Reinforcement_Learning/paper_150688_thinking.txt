To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realtime Spectrum Monitoring via Reinforcement Learning â€“ A Comparison Between Q-Learning and Heuristic Methods" by Tobias Braun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the performance of two approaches for controlling receiver resources but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Environment)**, where the authors describe the simulation setup. They mention that the data for testing the methods was generated through a computer simulation study, but they do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they created their own test data for the experiments.

In **section 3 (Generating Data)**, the authors detail how they generated training and validation data, specifying that they produced 10,000 observation series each, with binary feedback for signal detection. However, this data is synthetic and generated for the purpose of the study, rather than being sourced from an existing dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will not find any citations for datasets in the **References section**. The authors focus on their own generated data rather than utilizing established datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the generation of synthetic data for their experiments, it does not utilize or cite any external datasets. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to create for this paper, as all data used in the experiments is original and not sourced from other works.
