To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Generate Explainable Stock Predictions using Self-Reflective Large Language Models" by Kelvin J.L. Koa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a framework that fine-tunes a specialized LLM for stock prediction, which suggests that datasets are involved in the training and evaluation process.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data Collection and Clustering**. Here, the authors describe constructing a new dataset based on the methodology used for the **ACL18 StockNet dataset**. They mention collecting data for the top 5 stocks in 11 industries, which indicates a comprehensive dataset is being utilized.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- They mention that the original StockNet dataset covers the years 2014–2016, and they have updated it for the years 2020–2022.
- The dataset consists of tweets related to stock movements, with a total of **29,997 samples** collected over **757 trading days**.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are referenced. The authors discuss their experimental results and mention that they validate their framework using the constructed dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:
1. **ACL18 StockNet Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the foundational dataset for their work. The citation is:
   > Xu, Y., & Cohen, S. B. (2018). Stock movement prediction from tweets and historical prices. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 1970–1979.

2. **Custom Dataset**: The authors created a new dataset based on the StockNet methodology, but since it is a new dataset, it does not have a formal citation yet. However, I will note its significance and the years it covers (2020-2022).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed or referenced in future work.
