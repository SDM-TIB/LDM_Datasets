To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitively Inspired Learning of Incremental Drifting Concepts" by Mohammad Rostami and Aram Galstyan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a computational model for continual learning, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of continual learning and mentions concepts like "incremental learning" and "concept drift," but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, the authors mention using two benchmark datasets: **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** for incremental learning experiments. They describe the MNIST dataset as consisting of handwritten digits and the Fashion-MNIST dataset as containing images of fashion products. 

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **theoretical analysis** sections, but these sections primarily discuss methodologies and theoretical frameworks without introducing new datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the Fashion-MNIST dataset is:
   > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset in the required format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
