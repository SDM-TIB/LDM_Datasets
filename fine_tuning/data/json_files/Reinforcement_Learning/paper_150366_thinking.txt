To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computation Offloading for Uncertain Marine Tasks by Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels" by Jiahao You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may provide context and mention any datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their methodology and simulations in detail, which may include references to datasets used for testing their proposed algorithms. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the datasets utilized.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to the study. This is crucial, as many research papers rely on previously established datasets for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to gather the **full citations** for each dataset. This includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication. If the datasets are part of a larger study or project, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will look up that study to extract the full citation. If they reference a dataset that is publicly available, I will include the relevant details such as the URL or DOI if applicable.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured and can be used for further analysis or replication of the study.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper while ensuring that proper citations are included for each dataset.
