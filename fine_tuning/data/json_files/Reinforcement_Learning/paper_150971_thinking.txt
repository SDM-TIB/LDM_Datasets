To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-performance Power Allocation Strategies for Active IRS-aided Wireless Network" by Yifan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as a **"Datasets" or "Experimental Setup" section**. If such a section is present, it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will continue to scan through the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often mention datasets when discussing their experimental results, so I will pay close attention to any references made to datasets in these sections.

Once I identify any datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is well-known, I may also cross-reference it with other literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or presentation.
