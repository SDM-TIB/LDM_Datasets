To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Stopping with Application in Financial Engineering" by Abderrahim Fathan and Erick Delage, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of deep reinforcement learning in financial engineering, but it does not specify any datasets. However, it hints at empirical evaluations, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe two experiments involving financial engineering applications. They mention using historical stock data for the second experiment, specifically referencing the S&P 500 index.

I will look for specific dataset names and details in the text. The authors describe the datasets used in their experiments as follows:

1. **Bermudan Option Pricing Dataset**: This dataset consists of simulated trajectories based on a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The training set is composed of 160 sampled trajectories of 928 days each, with additional validation and test sets drawn from independently sampled trajectories.

2. **S&P 500 Stock Data**: This dataset includes stock trajectories from 111 stocks that compose the S&P 500 index, with data drawn from the period 2014-03-27 to 2019-12-10. The training set consists of trajectories from a subset of 60 different stocks, while the validation and test sets include other stocks from the same index.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are based on historical stock data and simulated trajectories, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the relevant papers that describe the methodologies used to generate or analyze these datasets.

For the **Bermudan Option Pricing Dataset**, the relevant citation is:
- Yuxi Li, Csaba Szepesvari, and Dale Schuurmans. *Learning exercise policies for American options*. In Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pages 352â€“359, 2009.

For the **S&P 500 Stock Data**, while there may not be a specific citation for the dataset itself, the authors reference the use of historical stock data from the S&P 500 index, which is widely available and can be cited as:
- S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
