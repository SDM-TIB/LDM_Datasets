To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoftTreeMax: Exponential Variance Reduction in Policy Gradient via Tree Search" by Gal Dalal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of SoftTreeMax in the context of Atari environments, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors likely used specific environments or datasets for their experiments, particularly since they mention testing on Atari games.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted their experiments on multiple games from the **Atari simulation suite**. This indicates that the Atari games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari simulation suite. The relevant citation is:

- **Atari simulation suite**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the Atari simulation suite.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise reference for anyone looking to understand the datasets used in this research.
