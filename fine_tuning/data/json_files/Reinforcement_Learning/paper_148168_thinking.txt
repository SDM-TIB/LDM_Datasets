To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZPD Teaching Strategies for Deep Reinforcement Learning from Demonstrations" by Daniel Seita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are used for evaluation.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup or the data collection process. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also examine the **experimental setup section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the specific datasets employed for training and evaluation, which is crucial for understanding the context of the results presented in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I expect to find references to the **Atari 2600 benchmarks**, as the authors mention evaluating their methods on nine Atari games. I will look for the specific citation for the Atari dataset, which is likely to be included in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
