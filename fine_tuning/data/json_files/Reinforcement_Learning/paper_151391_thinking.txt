To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Symbolic Regression for Heuristic Design in the Traveling Thief Problem" by Andrew Ni and Lee Spector, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background and Related Work)**, particularly subsection 2.1, which discusses the **TTP Benchmark Suite**. This section outlines how TTP instances are generated and may provide specific details about the datasets used for experiments. It mentions that TTP instances are derived from TSP instances in the TSPLIB library, which is a crucial dataset for this research.

In **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the specific TTP instances they evaluated their heuristics on, including any parameters or configurations that define these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper references the TSP instances from the TSPLIB library, which is essential for the TTP instances. I will ensure to include the citation for the TSPLIB library as it is a foundational dataset for the research.

The citation for the TSPLIB library is:
> Reinelt, G. (1991). A traveling salesman problem library. *ORSA Journal on Computing*, 3, 376–384. https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.3.4.376

Additionally, I will note that the TTP Benchmark Suite is based on the work by Polyakovskiy et al. (2014), which is also relevant for the datasets used in this research. The citation for this work is:
> Polyakovskiy, S., Bonyadi, M.R., Wagner, M., Michalewicz, Z., & Neumann, F. (2014). A comprehensive benchmark set and heuristics for the traveling thief problem. In *Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation* (pp. 477–484). Association for Computing Machinery. https://doi.org/10.1145/2576768.2598249

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing.
