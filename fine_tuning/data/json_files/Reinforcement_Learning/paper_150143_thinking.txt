To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spending Thinking Time Wisely: Accelerating MCTS with Virtual Expansions" by Weirui Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on "9 × 9 Go board games and Atari games," which indicates that these are the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on the **Go 9 × 9** board game and several **Atari games**. I will note the specific Atari games mentioned, as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

In the **setup section** (5.1), the authors specify that they use the **Go 9 × 9** game as a benchmark environment and mention that they also evaluate their method on a few **Atari games**. However, they do not list the specific Atari games in this section, so I will need to check the results section (5.2) for more details.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide results for various Atari games, including **Pong**, **Breakout**, **Seaquest**, **Hero**, and **Qbert**. This confirms that these games are part of the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The **Go 9 × 9** game is a well-known dataset, and I will cite it as follows:
- For **Go 9 × 9**, the citation is:
  > Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C. J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., Van Den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Antonoglou, I., Panneershelvam, V., Lanctot, M., et al. (2016). *Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search*. Nature, 529(7587), 484-489.

For the **Atari games**, since they are part of a benchmark suite, I will cite the original paper that introduced the Atari game environment:
- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., et al. (2015). *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540), 529-533.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted:
1. **Go 9 × 9**: A board game used as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method.
2. **Atari Games**: A collection of games including Pong, Breakout, Seaquest, Hero, and Qbert, used for performance evaluation.

Now, I will prepare to format these datasets into the required structure for further processing.
