To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Control for Radar Detection and Tracking in Congested Spectral Environments" by Charles E. Thornton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the application of deep reinforcement learning for radar performance but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Simulation Results)**, where the authors typically present experimental setups and datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating the radar's performance in various scenarios, including deterministic and stochastic environments, but I need to identify specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several types of interference signals used in their experiments, specifically:

1. **Frequency-Hopping Sweep**: This is a deterministic interference model that the radar system is tested against. However, it does not have a formal citation as it is a generated model.

2. **Markov Chain Interference**: This is another model used for testing, but again, it is not a dataset with a formal citation.

3. **Recorded Spectrum Data**: The authors mention using recorded data from the 2450MHz band, which includes unlicensed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals. This data is crucial for evaluating the radar's performance in real-world scenarios.

To find the full citation for the recorded spectrum data, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, it appears that the authors do not provide a specific citation for the recorded data, as it is likely proprietary or collected from a specific environment without a formal publication reference.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets used, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Frequency-Hopping Sweep**: A deterministic model used for testing radar performance. No formal citation available.

2. **Markov Chain Interference**: A stochastic model used for testing radar performance. No formal citation available.

3. **Recorded Spectrum Data from 2450MHz Band**: This includes real-world interference signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. No formal citation available.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, noting that the lack of formal citations limits the completeness of the dataset documentation. 

In conclusion, while I have identified the types of datasets used in the experiments, the absence of formal citations for the recorded data means that I cannot provide full references for them. This highlights the importance of clearly documenting datasets in research papers for reproducibility and verification.
