To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction" by Lorenzo Bisi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed methods in "two simulated financial environments," which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names or references.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 7) where the authors describe their empirical analysis. Here, they mention testing their algorithms on two environments: a **portfolio management task** and a **trading task**. I will need to check if these tasks are associated with specific datasets.

In the **portfolio management section**, the authors describe a liquid and non-liquid asset scenario but do not specify a dataset. However, they refer to a previous work by Di Castro et al. (2012) for the portfolio management task, which may imply that they used the same dataset as in that work. I will need to look up that reference for the dataset details.

In the **trading framework section**, the authors mention using historical data from the **S&P 500 index** starting from the 1980s until 2019. This is a specific dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **S&P 500 index** dataset, the citation is:
   > "Yahoo Finance. Historical Data for S&P 500 Index. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC"

2. For the **portfolio management task**, since it references the work by Di Castro et al. (2012), I will include that citation as well:
   > Di Castro, D., Tamar, A., and Mannor, S. (2012). "Policy gradients with variance related risk criteria." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 1-8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
