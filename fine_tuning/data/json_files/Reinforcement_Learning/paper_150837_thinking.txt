To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating more preferable text with Value-Guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search decoding" by Jiacheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on four text generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention four specific tasks, each associated with a dataset:

1. **OpenWebText Dataset**: This dataset is used for the sentiment steering task. The authors reference it as a well-known dataset for generating text with specified sentiment.

2. **RealToxicityPrompts Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the toxicity reduction task, where the goal is to generate less toxic text.

3. **HH-RLHF Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of creating helpful and harmless chatbots, indicating it contains data relevant to human preferences in dialogue.

4. **CommonsenseQA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the knowledge introspection task, which involves generating commonsense knowledge for question answering.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For the **OpenWebText Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
