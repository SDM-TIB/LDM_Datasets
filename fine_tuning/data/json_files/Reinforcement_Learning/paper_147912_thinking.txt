To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MinAtar: An Atari-Inspired Testbed for Thorough and Reproducible Reinforcement Learning Experiments" by Kenny Young and Tian Tian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or environments. The abstract introduces MinAtar as a new set of environments based on Atari games, which suggests that there are specific datasets or environments being discussed.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (The MinAtar Platform)**, where the authors describe the environments included in MinAtar. They mention five specific Atari-inspired environments: **Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix, Freeway, and Space Invaders**. Each environment is designed to simplify the representation learning problem while maintaining the core mechanics of the original games.

In this section, I will gather detailed descriptions of each environment, including their mechanics and how they are structured. This will help me understand the nature of the datasets being used.

After identifying the environments, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the original Atari games or any foundational works that describe these environments. The authors reference the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and other relevant literature, which may provide additional context or citations for the datasets.

The relevant citations I will extract include:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: an evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253â€“279.

2. **MinAtar**:
   > Young, K., & Tian, T. (2023). MinAtar: An Atari-Inspired Testbed for Thorough and Reproducible Reinforcement Learning Experiments. *Preprint*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries for each of the five environments mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for the original Atari games and the MinAtar platform itself.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
