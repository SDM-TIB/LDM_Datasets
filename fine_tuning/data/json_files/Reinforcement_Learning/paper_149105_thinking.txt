To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Propositional Encodings of Acyclicity and Reachability by using Vertex Elimination" by Masood Feyzbakhsh Rankooh and Jussi Rintanen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for empirical studies.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section 5 (Empirical Results and Discussion)**. In this section, the authors mention using benchmark problem sets from **Pandey and Rintanen (2018)**, which includes a total of 108 instances with underlying graphs. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the exact citation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the benchmark problem sets is:
> Pandey, B., and Rintanen, J. 2018. Planning for partial observability by SAT and graph constraints. In de Weerdt, M.; Koenig, S.; Roger, G.; and Spaan, M. T. J., eds., Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, ICAPS 2018, Delft, The Netherlands, June 24-29, 2018, 190–198. AAAI Press.

Additionally, the authors discuss using Hamiltonian cycles in grids as another dataset for their empirical results. I will also look for the citation related to this specific application. The relevant citation for the Hamiltonian cycles is:
> Gebser, M.; Janhunen, T.; and Rintanen, J. 2014b. SAT modulo graphs: Acyclicity. In Logics in Artificial Intelligence - 14th European Conference, JELIA 2014, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, September 24-26, 2014. Proceedings, volume 8761 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 137–151. Springer-Verlag.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Benchmark Problem Sets**: 
   - Citation: Pandey, B., and Rintanen, J. 2018. Planning for partial observability by SAT and graph constraints. In de Weerdt, M.; Koenig, S.; Roger, G.; and Spaan, M. T. J., eds., Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, ICAPS 2018, Delft, The Netherlands, June 24-29, 2018, 190–198. AAAI Press.

2. **Hamiltonian Cycle Datasets**:
   - Citation: Gebser, M.; Janhunen, T.; and Rintanen, J. 2014b. SAT modulo graphs: Acyclicity. In Logics in Artificial Intelligence - 14th European Conference, JELIA 2014, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, September 24-26, 2014. Proceedings, volume 8761 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 137–151. Springer-Verlag.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly articulated and ready for any further processing or review.
