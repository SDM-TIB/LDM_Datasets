To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampled Policy Gradient for Learning to Play the Game Agar.io" by Anton Orell Wiehe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their algorithms. In this paper, the authors discuss the environment inspired by the game Agar.io, but I need to look for any specific datasets or environments that are referenced.

I will also check the **appendix and references sections** for any additional details or citations related to datasets. The references may include foundational datasets or environments that the authors used in their experiments.

In this paper, the authors primarily discuss the game Agar.io as the environment for their experiments. They do not explicitly mention external datasets but describe the game mechanics and the setup for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset is the game environment itself, which is a simulation rather than a traditional dataset.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for external datasets, I will summarize the information about the game environment as follows:

1. **Agar.io Game Environment**: The paper describes the game Agar.io, which serves as the experimental environment for the reinforcement learning algorithms. The game is a multi-player online game where players control cells and compete against each other to grow by absorbing pellets and other players. The environment is dynamic and stochastic, making it suitable for testing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset description.

The citation for the paper is:
> Anton Orell Wiehe, Nil Stolt Ans√≥, Madalina M. Drugan, Marco A. Wiering. *Sampled Policy Gradient for Learning to Play the Game Agar.io*. Department of Artificial Intelligence, Bernoulli Institute, University of Groningen.

This citation will serve as the reference for the dataset derived from the Agar.io game environment. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring clarity and completeness in the description.
