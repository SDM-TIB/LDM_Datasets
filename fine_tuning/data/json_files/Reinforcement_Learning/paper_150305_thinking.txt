To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning" by Yaoyao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset contains 60,000 samples of 32 × 32 color images from 100 classes, with 500 training and 100 test samples for each class.

2. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the authors refer to two settings of this dataset:
   - **ImageNet-Subset**: A subset of 100 classes sampled from the full ImageNet dataset.
   - **ImageNet-Full**: The complete ImageNet dataset, which contains approximately 1.3 million samples of 224 × 224 color images from 1,000 classes.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
