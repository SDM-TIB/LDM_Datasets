To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StarCraft II Build Order Optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Islam Elnabarawy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on optimizing build orders in StarCraft II, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE) and mentions that it includes a set of anonymized replays from human matches and mini-games. This indicates that the SC2LE environment is a dataset used in the research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the use of the "BuildMarines" minigame, which is part of the SC2LE. This minigame serves as a controlled environment for testing the optimization of build orders, but it does not constitute a separate dataset.

Moving to the **experimental setup**, I will look for any additional datasets or resources that may have been utilized. The authors mention that the agent was developed using the SC2LE environment, which confirms that this is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the SC2LE environment. The relevant citation is:

- For **StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE)**, the citation is:
  > O. Vinyals, T. Ewalds, S. Bartunov, P. Georgiev, A. S. Vezhnevets, M. Yeo, A. Makhzani, H. Küttler, J. Agapiou, J. Schrittwieser, J. Quan, S. Gaffney, S. Petersen, K. Simonyan, T. Schaul, H. van Hasselt, D. Silver, T. Lillicrap, K. Calderone, P. Keet, A. Brunasso, D. Lawrence, A. Ekermo, J. Repp, and R. Tsing, “StarCraft II: A New Challenge for Reinforcement Learning,” 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the SC2LE environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
