To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variance Reduction Based Experience Replay for Policy Optimization" by Hua Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Locate Specific Datasets**: In the relevant sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. I will note down the names of the datasets, their characteristics (such as size, type, and any specific features), and how they were used in the experiments.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will create a detailed entry that includes:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its description and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
