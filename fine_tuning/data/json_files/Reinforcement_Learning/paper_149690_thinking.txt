To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling faster and more reliable sonographic assessment of gestational age through machine learning" by Chace Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development and validation of AI models using ultrasound images and videos, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the models were developed and evaluated using datasets prospectively collected as part of the **Fetal Age Machine Learning Initiative (FAMLI)** study. This indicates that the FAMLI dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

In the **results section**, the authors specify that their evaluation was performed on a test set consisting of 407 women, with complete ultrasound data available for 404 participants. This reinforces the importance of the FAMLI dataset in their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FAMLI dataset. The authors provide a link to the FAMLI study website, which is a crucial piece of information for citation purposes.

The citation for the FAMLI dataset is:
> FAMLI. UNC Global Womenâ€™s Health. https://gwh.web.unc.edu/famli/ (2018).

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **FAMLI Dataset**: This dataset includes ultrasound data collected from study sites at Chapel Hill, NC (USA) and Lusaka, Zambia. It consists of standard plane ultrasound images and "fly-to" videos collected during routine biometry measurements.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details, including full citations, are accurately documented.
