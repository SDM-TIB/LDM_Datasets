To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Co-Design for Variable Geometry Truss" by Jianzhe Gu and Lining Yao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets or experimental setups. This section typically details the methodologies employed, which may include specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

In this paper, I will look for any references to datasets in the context of the experiments or simulations conducted. If the authors mention using specific datasets for training their models or evaluating their methods, I will note these down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "PneuMesh" or any other dataset related to variable geometry trusses, I will ensure to find the original source or citation for that dataset. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will cite that original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. Each dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description of its contents or purpose, and the complete citation formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
