To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Airline Revenue Management: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Seat Inventory Control and Overbooking" by Syed Arbab Mohd Shihab et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the development of a basic air-travel market simulator to generate data for training the agent. This indicates that the simulator itself is a source of data, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will examine the **problem description and methodology sections**. Here, the authors describe the air travel market simulator in detail. They explain how the simulator generates data based on passenger booking requests, cancellations, and fare classes. However, they do not mention any external datasets or benchmarks used for validation or comparison.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the simulation model they developed, I will note that the dataset is generated internally through this simulator rather than sourced from existing datasets. The authors do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for an external dataset, as their work is based on the simulation they created.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if any foundational datasets or related works are cited that could be relevant. However, the references mainly consist of foundational papers on Markov Decision Processes, reinforcement learning, and airline revenue management, rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, the primary dataset referenced in this paper is the data generated by the air travel market simulator, which is not a publicly available dataset but rather a custom-built simulation for the purpose of this research. Therefore, I will summarize this as follows:

1. **Air Travel Market Simulator Data**: This dataset is generated through a custom simulator designed to model passenger booking behavior, cancellations, and fare class distributions. It does not have a formal citation as it is not an external dataset.

Since there are no external datasets with citations to provide, I will document this finding clearly in my output. The focus of the paper is on the methodology and results derived from the simulation rather than on established datasets from previous research.
