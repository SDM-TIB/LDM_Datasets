To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pixel to policy: DQN Encoders for within & cross-game reinforcement learning" by Sourabh Prakash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction outlines the context and objectives, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. In this section, they mention the **OpenAI Gym Atari games dataset**, which is a collection of gameplay data from various Atari games. The description includes details about the dataset's purpose, the types of games included, and the nature of the data (game frames, actions, rewards).

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methods or results sections** that may not have been covered in the datasets section. However, it appears that the primary dataset discussed is the OpenAI Gym Atari games dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym Atari games dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym Atari games dataset is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
