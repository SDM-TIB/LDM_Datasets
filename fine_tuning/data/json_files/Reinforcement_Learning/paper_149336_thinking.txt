To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Adjustments" by Hamed Khorasgani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field of deep reinforcement learning. This section may also highlight the significance of the datasets in the context of their research.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. This is where the authors typically describe the experimental setup, including the datasets used for training and testing their proposed algorithms.

Following that, I will review the **experimental results** section, as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments, including any performance metrics or comparisons made against other methods.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MountainCarContinuous** dataset from OpenAI Gym, I will note that down and look for its citation in the references. The citation for this dataset would typically be found in the context of the OpenAI Gym documentation or related publications.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
