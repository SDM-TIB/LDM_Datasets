To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On The Value of Chess Squares" by Aditya Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the development of Chess AI and the need for evaluating chess positions, which suggests that they may have utilized datasets of chess games for their analysis. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or sources of data.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Methods)**, where the authors describe how they constructed their dataset. They mention creating a comprehensive dataset derived from an extensive chess database, which is crucial for understanding the scope and nature of the data used. They also reference the use of the Stockfish engine for evaluations, which indicates that the dataset is likely based on positions from actual chess games.

In **section 2.4 (Data)**, the authors detail the process of constructing the training dataset, which includes parsing millions of chess games represented in Portable Game Notation (PGN). This section is critical as it outlines the dataset's composition, including the state information and evaluations associated with each position.

The authors specifically mention that they analyzed a dataset comprising over **2000 Grandmaster games** to predict winning probabilities and Centipawn evaluations for specific subsets of states. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Grandmaster Games Dataset**: The authors analyzed a dataset of over 2000 Grandmaster games. While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is derived from publicly available chess game databases. A commonly referenced source for such datasets is:
   > "The Mega Database" by ChessBase, which contains millions of games played by various players, including Grandmasters.

2. **Stockfish Engine**: The authors utilized the Stockfish chess engine for evaluations. The citation for the Stockfish engine is:
   > T. Romstad, M. Costalba, J. Kiiski, G. Linscott, S. Nicolet, S. Geschwentner, and J. VandeVondele. *Stockfish*, 2022. URL https://stockfishchess.org. Accessed: 13 April 2022.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset in the required format, including the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, facilitating further analysis or reference.
