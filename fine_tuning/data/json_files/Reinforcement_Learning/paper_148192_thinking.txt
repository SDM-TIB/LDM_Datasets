To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Challenging On Car Racing Problem from OpenAI gym" by Changmao Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the car racing problem from the OpenAI gym environment, which suggests that the dataset used is related to this environment. The introduction confirms that the project is based on the **CarRacing-v0 challenge** from OpenAI gym, indicating that this is the primary dataset being utilized.

Next, I will look for any specific details about the dataset in the **methodology** section. The paper describes the CarRacing environment, including the state representation (96x96 pixels) and the reward structure, but it does not mention any additional datasets or variations. Since the CarRacing-v0 challenge is a well-known dataset, I will need to ensure I provide the correct citation for it.

I will then check the **references section** to find the appropriate citation for the CarRacing dataset. The CarRacing environment is part of the OpenAI Gym, and the relevant citation is:

- For the **CarRacing-v0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Shinn, J., and Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or variations, I will conclude that the only dataset referenced is the CarRacing-v0 from OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CarRacing-v0 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for review or further processing.
