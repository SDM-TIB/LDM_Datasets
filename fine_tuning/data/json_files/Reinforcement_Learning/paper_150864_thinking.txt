To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Option Discovery for Planning" by Kenny Young and Richard S. Sutton, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the following sections:

1. **Section 5 (Does Option Iteration Learn Useful Options for Monte-Carlo Search?)**: This section discusses the experiments conducted, and it is likely to mention the datasets used for testing the proposed method.

2. **Appendices**: Sometimes, additional details about datasets are provided in the appendices, so I will check these sections for any relevant information.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the necessary details for each one, including:

- **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
- **Full Citation**: I will locate the full citation for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "ElectricProcMaze," I will look for its description in the experiments section and then find its citation in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference and review.
