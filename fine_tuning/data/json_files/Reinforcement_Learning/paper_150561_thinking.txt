To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Augmentation for Multimodal Learning Under Presentation Bias" by Victoria Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract discusses the concept of presentation bias and mentions empirical evaluations, which may indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Airbnb Dataset**: This dataset consists of 22,895 Airbnb listings for the city of Melbourne, including metadata, text descriptions, and images of the properties. The nightly price of the listing is the label.

2. **Clothing Dataset**: This dataset comprises 23,486 reviews of womenâ€™s clothing from an online retailer, which includes metadata, the title, and the text of the review. The review score is treated as the label.

3. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is a synthetic version of the Airbnb dataset, where the features are taken from the real dataset, but the label is synthesized as a noisy function of the tabular and multimodal features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For the **Airbnb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shi, X., Mueller, J., Erickson, N., Li, M., & Smola, A. J. (2021). Benchmarking multimodal automl for tabular data with text fields. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

- For the **Clothing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shi, X., Mueller, J., Erickson, N., Li, M., & Smola, A. J. (2021). Benchmarking multimodal automl for tabular data with text fields. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

- The **Synthetic Dataset** is based on the Airbnb dataset and does not have a separate citation since it is derived from the original dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details about the datasets are captured accurately.
