To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning to Payment Fraud" by Siddharth Vimal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two publicly available fraud datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **European Card Data (ECD)**: This dataset contains 284,807 transactions with 31 features, including 492 fraud transactions, making it highly imbalanced. The authors note that the numerical features result from PCA transformation for confidentiality reasons.

2. **IEEE-CIS Fraud Dataset**: This dataset consists of 590,540 transactions, with 20,663 labeled as fraud, resulting in a class imbalance ratio of approximately 3.5%. It includes various numerical and categorical features, along with time and amount columns.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets mentioned are publicly available and typically cited in their respective repositories. Therefore, I will look for the appropriate citations for these datasets:

- For the **European Card Data (ECD)**, the citation is:
  > Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A Johnson, and Gianluca Bontempi. *Calibrating probability with undersampling for unbalanced classification*. In 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence. IEEE, 159–166.

- For the **IEEE-CIS Fraud Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **European Card Data (ECD)**:
   - Citation: Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A Johnson, and Gianluca Bontempi. *Calibrating probability with undersampling for unbalanced classification*. In 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence. IEEE, 159–166.

2. **IEEE-CIS Fraud Dataset**:
   - Citation: Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
