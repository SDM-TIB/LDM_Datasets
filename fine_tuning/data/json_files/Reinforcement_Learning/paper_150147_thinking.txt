To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biologically Plausible Variational Policy Gradient with Spiking Recurrent Winner-Take-All Networks" by Zhile Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST classification** and **Gym InvertedPendulum**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the tasks they performed, specifically highlighting the **MNIST dataset** for image classification and the **Gym InvertedPendulum** environment for reinforcement learning tasks. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Gym InvertedPendulum**: The citation for the Gym InvertedPendulum environment is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vitchyr Pong, Trevor Darrell, and John Schulman. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels.
- **Gym InvertedPendulum**: A reinforcement learning environment that simulates an inverted pendulum on a cart, commonly used for testing control algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and future use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
