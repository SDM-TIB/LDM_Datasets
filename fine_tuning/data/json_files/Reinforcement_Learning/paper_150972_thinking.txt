To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Learn for Few-shot Continual Active Learning" by Stella Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on benchmark text classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of few-shot continual active learning and hints at the use of specific datasets for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention using benchmark datasets from Zhang et al. (2015), which includes five text classification datasets from four different domains. The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **AGNews**: A dataset for news classification with 4 classes.
2. **Yelp**: A dataset for sentiment analysis with 5 classes.
3. **Amazon**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes.
4. **DBpedia**: A dataset for Wikipedia article classification with 14 classes.
5. **Yahoo**: A dataset for questions and answers categorization with 10 classes.

The authors also provide details about how they sampled instances from these datasets, which further confirms their relevance to the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper cites Zhang et al. (2015) as the source for these datasets. I will look up the full citation for this reference:

- For the datasets from Zhang et al. (2015), the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J.J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, December 7-12, 2015, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, pp. 649â€“657.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **AGNews**: News classification dataset with 4 classes.
   - Citation: Zhang et al. (2015).

2. **Yelp**: Sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes.
   - Citation: Zhang et al. (2015).

3. **Amazon**: Sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes.
   - Citation: Zhang et al. (2015).

4. **DBpedia**: Wikipedia article classification dataset with 14 classes.
   - Citation: Zhang et al. (2015).

5. **Yahoo**: Questions and answers categorization dataset with 10 classes.
   - Citation: Zhang et al. (2015).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
