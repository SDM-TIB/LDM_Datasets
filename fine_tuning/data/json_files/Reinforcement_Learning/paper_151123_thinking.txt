To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Navigation of Tractor-Trailer Vehicles through Roundabout Intersections" by Daniel Attarda and Josef Bajada, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed truck and trailer models and established a baseline dataset for benchmarks, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the dataset. They mention the lack of publicly available models for tractor-trailer vehicles and highlight their contributions, including a dataset of several roundabout scenarios. This confirms that a dataset is being discussed.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the dataset. The authors describe the use of the Carla simulator to create custom scenarios, which implies that the dataset consists of various roundabout scenarios generated within this simulation environment. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset.

I will also check the **experimental results section** to see if there are any additional details or references to the dataset used in their experiments. The authors mention testing on roundabouts with different physical properties, but again, they do not specify a formal name for the dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will refer to the Carla simulator documentation and relevant literature to find the appropriate citation for the simulation environment used to create the dataset. The Carla simulator is a well-known open-source project, and its citation is as follows:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1â€“16, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the Carla simulator as the source of the dataset.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is a collection of roundabout scenarios generated using the Carla simulator, and the citation for this dataset is based on the simulator itself. I will prepare the final output accordingly.
