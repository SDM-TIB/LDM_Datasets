To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The LoCA Regret: A Consistent Metric to Evaluate Model-Based Behavior in Reinforcement Learning" by Harm van Seijen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of a metric for evaluating model-based behavior in reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific tasks or environments that are referenced as datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention using a modified version of the **Mountain Car** environment for their experiments. They describe how they added an additional terminal state to the classic Mountain Car task, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation. Instead, they refer to the environment itself, which is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that correspond to datasets or environments used in the experiments. The references include various papers related to reinforcement learning methods but do not specifically cite datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses the experimental setup and results without providing formal datasets, I will summarize the relevant environments mentioned:

1. **Mountain Car Task**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where an underpowered cart must move up a hill. The authors modified this task to include an additional terminal state.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the environments mentioned:

- For the **Mountain Car Task**, the original reference is:
  > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (1998). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the modified Mountain Car task, I will note that it is based on the original environment as described in the reference above.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Mountain Car task as it is the only relevant environment discussed in the paper.
