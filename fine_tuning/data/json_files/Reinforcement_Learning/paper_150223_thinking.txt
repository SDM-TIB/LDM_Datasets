To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combined Peak Reduction and Self-Consumption Using Proximal Policy Optimization" by Thijs Peirelinck et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a demand response use case, which suggests that data from real households is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology in detail. In this section, they mention using data from a field test in the Netherlands, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the datasets used, such as their characteristics or how they were collected.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention three types of data used in their experiments:

1. **Simulated PV production data**: This data is taken from the ninja tool developed by Pfenninger and Staffell. It is used to simulate the photovoltaic energy production for the households involved in the study.

2. **Electrical load data**: This data is generated using Strobe, which is a tool for simulating electrical loads in residential settings.

3. **Domestic Hot Water (DHW) consumption data**: This dataset comes from a study by Edwards et al. and provides information on the hot water consumption patterns of households.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **simulated PV production data**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Pfenninger and Iain Staffell. *Long-term patterns of European PV output using 30 years of validated hourly reanalysis and satellite data*. Energy, 114:1251–1265, nov 2016.

- For the **electrical load data**, the citation is:
  > Ruben Baetens, Roel De Coninck, Filip Jorissen, Damien Picard, Lieve Helsen, and Dirk Saelens. *Openideas-an open framework for integrated district energy simulations*. In Proceedings of Building Simulation 2015, pages 347 – 354, 2015.

- For the **DHW consumption data**, the citation is:
  > Skai Edwards, Ian Beausoleil-Morrison, and André Laperriére. *Representative hot water draw profiles at high temporal resolution for simulating the performance of solar thermal systems*. Solar Energy, 111:43–52, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the requirements of the task. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
