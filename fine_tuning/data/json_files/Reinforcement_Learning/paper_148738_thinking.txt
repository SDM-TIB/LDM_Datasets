To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do We Exploit all Information for Counterfactual Analysis? Benefits of Factor Models and Idiosyncratic Correction" by Jianqing Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the data consists of daily sales and prices of five different products over more than 400 municipalities in Brazil. This indicates that there is a dataset related to retail sales and pricing.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 6 (Price Elasticity of Demand)**, which explicitly describes the dataset. Here, the authors mention that the dataset consists of daily prices and quantities sold of five different products aggregated at the municipal level. This section provides valuable insights into the structure and content of the dataset.

In **section 6.1**, the authors elaborate on the dataset, stating that it includes daily sales data from over 1,400 stores across various municipalities, which is crucial for understanding the scope of the dataset. They also mention that the products belong to the sweets and candies category, which helps in categorizing the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the data collection process. The authors describe a randomized controlled experiment conducted to evaluate price changes, which reinforces the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is related to the daily sales and prices of products, and I will ensure to document it accurately:

1. **Dataset of Daily Sales and Prices**:
   - Description: This dataset includes daily sales and prices of five different products aggregated at the municipal level across more than 400 municipalities in Brazil.
   - Citation: Fan, J., Masini, R., & Medeiros, M. C. (2022). Do We Exploit all Information for Counterfactual Analysis? Benefits of Factor Models and Idiosyncratic Correction. *Journal of Econometrics*.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets and their citations. This will allow for proper referencing and further analysis in future work.
