To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Match Made in Heaven: A Multi-task Framework for Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection" by Naveen Badathala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors annotated two hyperbole datasets (HYPO and HYPO-L) with metaphor labels and two metaphor datasets (TroFi and LCC) with hyperbole labels. This suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets and Annotations** section (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of sentences they contain.

1. **HYPO Dataset**: This dataset contains 709 hyperbolic sentences, each paired with a paraphrased literal sentence, resulting in a total of 1,418 sentences. The authors have annotated this dataset with metaphor labels.

2. **HYPO-L Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,007 hyperbolic sentences and 2,219 paraphrased sentences, also annotated with metaphor labels.
   - Citation: Zhang, Y., & Wan, X. (2022). MOVER: Mask, over-generate and rank for hyperbole generation. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 6018–6030).

3. **TroFi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,838 sentences, of which 709 have been annotated with hyperbole labels.
   - Citation: Birke, J., & Sarkar, A. (2006). A clustering approach for nearly unsupervised recognition of nonliteral language. In 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 329–336).

4. **LCC Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,542 sentences, with 1,710 annotated with hyperbole labels.
   - Citation: Mohler, M., Brunson, M., Rink, B., & Tomlinson, M. (2016). Introducing the LCC metaphor datasets. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16) (pp. 4221–4227).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details, including the number of sentences and the specific annotations made for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly labeled with its citation for future use.
