To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigation of micro-robot swarms for targeted delivery using reinforcement learning" by Akshatha Jagadish and Manoj Varma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections for detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of reinforcement learning for navigating micro-robots but do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **methods section**, particularly looking for any subsections that describe the experimental setup or simulations, as these often contain references to datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **methods section**, I find that the authors describe a simulated model of micro-swimmers and the environment in which they operate. However, they do not reference any external datasets; instead, they create their own simulation environment for the experiments. This indicates that the data generated during the experiments is based on their simulation rather than a pre-existing dataset.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for comparison or validation of their results. However, it appears that the experiments are conducted solely within the context of their simulation model, and no external datasets are referenced.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to ensure that there are no overlooked datasets mentioned in the citations. The references primarily consist of literature related to micro-robotics and reinforcement learning but do not point to any specific datasets.

Since the paper does not utilize any external datasets but rather relies on a custom simulation model, I will note that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. 

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that the research does not reference any external datasets but instead relies on a simulation model for its experiments. This will be documented accordingly.
