To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Learning for Camera Calibration" by Talha Hanif Butt and Murtaza Taj, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new dataset called the **CVGL Camera Calibration Dataset**, which is a strong indication that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **CVGL Camera Calibration Dataset**: This dataset was created using the CARLA Simulator and consists of 50 camera configurations, with a total of 1,23,017 image pairs. The configurations include various parameters such as field of view, translation, and rotation.

2. **Cyclist Detection Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the authors' approach on real-world data and contains 2,914 images. The dataset is referenced as a recent benchmark for vision-based cyclist detection.

3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluation and consists of 1,525 images. It is a well-known dataset for semantic urban scene understanding.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CVGL Camera Calibration Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Talha Hanif Butt and Murtaza Taj. "Camera calibration through camera projection loss." In *ICASSP 2022-2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)*, pp. 2649–2653. IEEE, 2022.

- For the **Cyclist Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaofei Li, Fabian Flohr, Yue Yang, Hui Xiong, Markus Braun, Shuyue Pan, Keqiang Li, and Dariu M. Gavrila. "A new benchmark for vision-based cyclist detection." In *IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium*, pp. 1028–1033, 2016.

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. "The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding." In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, pp. 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
