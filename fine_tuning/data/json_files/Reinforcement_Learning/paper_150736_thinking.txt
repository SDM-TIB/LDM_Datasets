To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Accurate Reduced-Order Modeling of a MOOSE-based Additive Manufacturing Model with Operator Learning" by Mahmoud Yaseen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous work and datasets that are relevant to their study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior studies that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they generated their data. They mention using **Latin hypercube sampling** to create 500 samples of input parameters for the MOOSE-based AM model, which indicates that they generated a dataset based on these parameters. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the parameters and their ranges.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used for training and validation. The authors mention dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding how the data was utilized.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **MOOSE-based AM Model Dataset**: This dataset was generated using Latin hypercube sampling of five input parameters (laser power, scanning speed, laser effective radius, laser efficiency coefficient, and scaling factor) across specified ranges. The dataset includes time-dependent responses for bead volume and maximum melt pool temperature over 200 time steps.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or models referenced in the paper. However, since the dataset is generated from the authors' own simulations, there may not be an external citation for it.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to attribute the dataset correctly.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Mahmoud Yaseen, Dewen Yushu, Peter German, Xu Wu. *Fast and Accurate Reduced-Order Modeling of a MOOSE-based Additive Manufacturing Model with Operator Learning*. The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, August 7, 2023.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
