To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoRL Hyperparameter Landscapes" by Aditya Mohan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors provide empirical evidence regarding hyperparameter landscapes across various reinforcement learning algorithms and environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4 (Method)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention collecting performance data for hyperparameters across different phases of training, which indicates that they are using specific datasets for their experiments.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors detail their experimental setup, specifying the reinforcement learning algorithms and environments used. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Cartpole**: This is a classic control problem in reinforcement learning, often used as a benchmark for evaluating algorithms.
2. **Bipedal Walker**: Another environment used for testing reinforcement learning algorithms, which involves controlling a bipedal robot to walk.
3. **Hopper**: A reinforcement learning environment where the objective is to control a one-legged robot to hop forward.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or the papers that introduced these environments:

- For **Cartpole**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540 [cs.LG].

- For **Bipedal Walker**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540 [cs.LG].

- For **Hopper**, the citation is also:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540 [cs.LG].

Since all three environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
