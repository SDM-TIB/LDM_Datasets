To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empowering recommender systems using automatically generated Knowledge Graphs and Reinforcement Learning" by Ghanshyam Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of knowledge graphs and recommender systems, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used. In this section, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they utilized, which includes customer interactions and articles sent to them.

The paper states that the dataset contains information about 463 customers and approximately 80 articles each received over a specific period, totaling 37,423 rows of data. This dataset is crucial for understanding customer behavior and preferences in the context of their recommender systems.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors indicate that the dataset is publicly available on a GitHub repository, which is a key piece of information for citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Verma, G., Simanta, S., Chen, H., Pillai, D., McCrae, J. P., Perge, J. A., Sengupta, S., & Buitelaar, P. (2023). Empowering recommender systems using automatically generated Knowledge Graphs and Reinforcement Learning. In Proceedings of online and adaptive recommender systems (KDD-OARS). ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://github.com/GhanshyamVerma/Explainable-Recommender-System.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis of the dataset in the context of the research presented in the paper.
