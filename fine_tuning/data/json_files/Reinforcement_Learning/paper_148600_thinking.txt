To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of AI-based Intrusion Detection Techniques in Critical Infrastructures" by Safa Otoum, Burak Kantarci, and Hussein Mouftah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their mechanisms using the **KDD’99 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the importance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and mention the KDD’99 dataset as a real attack dataset used in their simulations. This confirms that KDD’99 is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed information about the KDD’99 dataset, including its structure and the number of records. They mention that the KDD’99 dataset contains around 311,029 records for testing and 494,020 records for training, with each record containing 41 features. This section also describes the types of attacks included in the dataset, which further validates its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KDD’99 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Irvine The UCI KDD Archive, University of California. KDD Cup 1999 Data. Available at http://www.kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99/html/, Last Visit: April.10.2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **KDD’99 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed intrusion detection systems. It contains approximately 311,029 records for testing and 494,020 records for training, with each record having 41 features. The dataset includes various attack types categorized into groups such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
