To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frugal Reinforcement-based Active Learning" by Sebastien Deschamps and Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on staple image classification data, including **Object-DOTA**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify the datasets used. The authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Jefferson Dataset**: This dataset is used for satellite image change detection and consists of 2,200 non-overlapping patch pairs of 30 × 30 RGB pixels each. The dataset is derived from GeoEye-1 satellite images taken in 2010 and 2011, showing various changes due to tornadoes.

2. **Object-DOTA Dataset**: This dataset is used for remote sensing object classification and contains 127,759 remote sensing snapshots belonging to 15 categories. The images were collected from Google Earth and various satellites, with dimensions ranging from 800² to 20,000² pixels.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **Jefferson Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Sahbi, Sebastien Deschamps, and Andrei Stoian. "Frugal Learning for Interactive Satellite Image Change Detection." In Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2021.

- For the **Object-DOTA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xia, Gui-Song, et al. "DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
