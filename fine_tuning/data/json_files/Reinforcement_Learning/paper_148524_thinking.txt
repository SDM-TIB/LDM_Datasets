To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: Near-Optimal Risk-Sample Tradeoff in Regret" by Yingjie Fei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain comprehensive information about each dataset. This section may include details such as the dataset's purpose, the methodology for data collection, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile it into a structured format that includes:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the datasets used in the research and how they contribute to the findings of the paper. This structured approach will help maintain accuracy and completeness in documenting the datasets.
