To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUNRISE: A Simple Unified Framework for Ensemble Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kimin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of SUNRISE on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using **OpenAI Gym** and **DeepMind Control Suite** for continuous control tasks, and **Atari games** for discrete control tasks. These are likely the datasets I need to extract.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the environments used for testing SUNRISE. They specifically mention several environments from OpenAI Gym, such as Cheetah, Walker, Hopper, Ant, and SlimHumanoid, as well as environments from the DeepMind Control Suite like Finger-spin, Cartpole-swing, and others. They also reference various Atari games, which are part of the Arcade Learning Environment.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., & Lefrancq, A. (2018). DeepMind Control Suite. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690*.

3. **Atari Games**:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
