To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised learning via DQN for log anomaly detection" by Yingying He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the evaluation was conducted on "three widely-used datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. This prompts me to look for the names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide descriptions of three datasets:

1. **HDFS Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the Hadoop Distributed File System and contains 11,172,157 log messages generated from 29 events, with approximately 2.9% indicating system anomalies.

2. **BGL Dataset**: Generated by the Blue Gene/L supercomputer, this dataset consists of 4,747,963 log messages from 376 events, with 348,460 flagged as abnormal (7.34%).

3. **Thunderbird Dataset**: This dataset contains over 200 million log messages, with 4,934 identified as abnormal (0.49%).

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **HDFS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei Xu, Ling Huang, Armando Fox, David Patterson, and Michael I. Jordan. *Detecting large-scale system problems by mining console logs*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pages 117–132, 2009.

- For the **BGL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adam Oliner and Jon Stearley. *What supercomputers say: A study of five system logs*. In 37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN’07), pages 575–584, 2007.

- For the **Thunderbird Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yinglung Liang, Yanyong Zhang, Hui Xiong, and Ramendra Sahoo. *Failure prediction in IBM BlueGene/L event logs*. In Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007), pages 583–588, 2007.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper.
