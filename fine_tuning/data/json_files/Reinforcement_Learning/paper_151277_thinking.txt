To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Longitudinal Counterfactual Explanations: Constraints and Opportunities" by Alexander Asemota and Giles Hooker, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of longitudinal data to assess plausibility in counterfactuals, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention using the **MIMIC-III** dataset for their experiments related to predicting acute respiratory failure. They describe the dataset as an electronic health records (EHR) dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors refer to the **Adult-Income** dataset, which is commonly used in fairness and explainability research. They describe how they simulate longitudinal data based on this dataset, indicating its importance in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III Clinical Database (version 1.4)*. 2016. https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26

2. For the **Adult-Income dataset**, the citation is:
   > Frances Ding, Moritz Hardt, John Miller, and Ludwig Schmidt. *Retiring Adult: New Datasets for Fair Machine Learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference.
