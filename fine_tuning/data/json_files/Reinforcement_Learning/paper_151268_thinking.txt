To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Human-Centric Aware UAV Trajectory Planning in Search and Rescue Missions Employing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with AHP and Similarity-Based Experience Replay" by Mahya Ramezani and Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the research focus but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will look for details in the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of UAVs into SAR missions and the importance of human-centric factors, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more concrete information.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the experimental environment and the simulation setup. They mention using a simulated environment with various parameters but do not specify any real-world datasets. Instead, they refer to the use of a survey to assess public perceptions of gender cues in drone design, which may imply that the survey data could be considered a dataset.

Next, I will look for the **survey instrument** section, where the authors detail how they conducted their survey. They mention using advanced AI-based generative models (DALLÂ·E-2) to create drone designs and conducting a survey with 150 participants. This survey data is crucial as it provides insights into human perceptions and preferences regarding drone designs.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **Survey Data on Gender Cues in Drone Design**: This dataset includes responses from 150 participants regarding their perceptions of different drone designs based on gender cues. The survey assessed various attributes and preferences related to drone interactions in SAR missions.

To find the full citation for the survey methodology, I will refer to the references section. The authors cite several studies that informed their survey design, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation since the survey is original research conducted by the authors.

The relevant citation for the survey methodology is:
> Ramezani, M., & Sanchez-Lopez, J. L. (2024). Deep Human-Centric Aware UAV Trajectory Planning in Search and Rescue Missions Employing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with AHP and Similarity-Based Experience Replay. In Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS).

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for the identified dataset. The survey data is the primary dataset derived from this research, and it is essential to note that while the authors conducted the survey, they did not reference an external dataset.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry based on the survey conducted, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset.
