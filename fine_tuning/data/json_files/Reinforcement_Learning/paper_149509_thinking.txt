To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replay For Safety" by Liran Szlak and Ohad Shamir, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experience replay in reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors conducted experiments in two grid world environments. However, they do not mention any specific datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized. Instead, they describe the environments they created for their experiments, which are not standard datasets but rather custom setups for testing their proposed methods.

Since there are no publicly available datasets referenced in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of works related to reinforcement learning and experience replay, without specific datasets being highlighted.

Given this analysis, I conclude that while the paper discusses the concept of experience replay and its application in reinforcement learning, it does not provide any specific datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were identified in the paper.

In summary, my steps were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for specific datasets used.
3. Check the references for any external datasets.
4. Conclude that no specific datasets were mentioned or cited.

As a result, I will not create any dataset entries since there are no datasets to document from this paper.
