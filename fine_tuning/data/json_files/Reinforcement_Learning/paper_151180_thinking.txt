To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Robot Sketching: An application of Deep Q-Learning Networks for human-like sketching" by Raul Fernandez-Fernandez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the authors mention using the **Quick, Draw! dataset** for their experiments, which is a significant clue.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) in detail, as it typically contains specific information about the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly state that they selected sketches from the **Quick, Draw! dataset** for their experiments. They mention that they randomly selected thirteen categories from this dataset, which confirms its use in their research.

I will also check the **related works section** and **framework section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary dataset of interest appears to be the **Quick, Draw! dataset**.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Quick, Draw! dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **Quick, Draw! dataset**: 
  > Jongejan, J., Rowley, H., Kawashima, T., Kim, J., & Fox-Gieg, N. (2016). The quick, draw!-ai experiment, Vol. 17 (p. 4). Mount View, CA.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
