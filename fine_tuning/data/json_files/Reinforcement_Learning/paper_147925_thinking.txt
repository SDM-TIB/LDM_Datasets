To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Characterizing Divergence in Deep Q-Learning" by Joshua Achiam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an algorithm and mentions performance on "standard MuJoCo benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym." This indicates that datasets related to MuJoCo might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using "standard MuJoCo benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym." I will look for specific names of these benchmarks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several environments from the OpenAI Gym, specifically:

1. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A continuous control task where the agent must learn to run as fast as possible.
2. **Walker2d-v2**: Another continuous control task where the agent learns to walk.
3. **Ant-v2**: A more complex continuous control task where the agent must learn to walk and navigate obstacles.
4. **Hopper-v2**: A task where the agent learns to hop forward.
5. **Swimmer-v2**: A task where the agent learns to swim.

These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which provides a suite of reinforcement learning environments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the OpenAI Gym and the MuJoCo environments. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

For the MuJoCo environments, they are typically referenced in the context of the OpenAI Gym, so the citation for the environments can be attributed to the same source.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset used in the experiments.

1. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A continuous control task where the agent must learn to run as fast as possible.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
