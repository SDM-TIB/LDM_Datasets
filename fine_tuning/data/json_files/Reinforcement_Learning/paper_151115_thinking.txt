To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPQR: Controlling Q-ensemble Independence with Spiked Random Model for Reinforcement Learning" by Dohyeok Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention that they implemented SPQR in various online and offline reinforcement learning tasks, specifically mentioning environments like **MuJoCo**, **D4RL Gym**, **Franka Kitchen**, and **Antmaze**. 

I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions in the context of these environments. For instance, the paper discusses using datasets such as **hopper-random**, **hopper-medium**, **walker2d-medium**, and others from the D4RL benchmark. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, I will find citations for:
- **D4RL**: The citation for the D4RL dataset is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

- **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
  > Emo Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

Once I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for presentation or further analysis.
