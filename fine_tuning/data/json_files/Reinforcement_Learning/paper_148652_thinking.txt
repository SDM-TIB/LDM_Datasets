To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning in 5G Scheduler Design: From Theoretical Framework to Implementation" by Zhouyou Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for 5G scheduler design, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, they mention simulation results and a prototype implementation, but I need to look for specific datasets.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. However, it appears that the focus is more on methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In the **simulation setup section**, the authors provide details about the system setup and parameters used in their experiments, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. They refer to a simulation platform and a prototype based on an open-source LTE software suite, which suggests that they may have used synthetic data generated from simulations rather than publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none explicitly referenced. However, I will note that the authors utilized simulation data and a prototype for their experiments.

In conclusion, I will summarize that the paper does not provide specific datasets but relies on simulation data and a prototype implementation for its experiments. If any datasets were mentioned, I would have extracted their details and full citations accordingly.
