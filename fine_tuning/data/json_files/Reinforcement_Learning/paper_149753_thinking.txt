To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EPiDA: An Easy Plug-in Data Augmentation Framework for High Performance Text Classification" by Jiandong Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of data augmentation for NLP tasks, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this section, the authors mention five different tasks and the datasets associated with them:

1. **TREC Dataset**: Used for question classification, with 5,452 samples.
   - Citation: Li, X., & Roth, D. (2002). Learning question classifiers. In *COLING 2002: The 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics*.

2. **AGNews Dataset**: Used for news classification, with 120,000 samples.
   - Citation: Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 28, 649-657.

3. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: Contains 20,631 samples from Twitter.
   - Citation: Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Nakov, P. (2017). Semeval-2017 task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter. In *Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017)*.

4. **Irony Detection Dataset**: Contains 3,817 samples from tweets.
   - Citation: Van Hee, C., Lefever, E., & Hoste, V. (2018). Semeval-2018 task 3: Irony detection in English tweets. In *Proceedings of The 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation*.

5. **Offense Detection Dataset**: Contains 99,603 samples from tweets.
   - Citation: Founta, A. M., Djouvas, C., Chatzakou, D., et al. (2018). Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of Twitter abusive behavior. In *Twelfth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*.

After identifying these datasets, I will cross-reference the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the study.
