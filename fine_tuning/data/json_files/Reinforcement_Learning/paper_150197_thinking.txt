To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning Irregular Object Packing via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Sichao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for packing irregular objects, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenges in robotic packing but does not name any datasets either.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the proposed method. In this section, the authors state that all objects for packing in their experiments come from the **YCB dataset** and the **OCRTOC dataset**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **YCB dataset**, the citation is:
   > Calli, B., Walsman, A., Singh, A., Srinivasa, S., Abbeel, P., & Dollar, A. M. (2015). Benchmarking in manipulation research: The YCB object and model set and benchmarking protocols. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.03143*.

2. For the **OCRTOC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Liu, W., Qin, Y., Xiang, F., Gou, M., Xin, S., Roa, M. A., Calli, B., Su, H., Sun, Y., et al. (2021). OCRTOC: A cloud-based competition and benchmark for robotic grasping and manipulation. *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 7*(1), 486-493.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **YCB dataset**: Calli et al. (2015)
- **OCRTOC dataset**: Liu et al. (2021)

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the research paper along with their full citations for proper attribution.
