To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FASTER-CE: Fast, Sparse, Transparent, and Robust Counterfactual Explanations" by Shubham Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three datasets of varied complexities," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **UCI Adult Dataset**: This dataset contains 48,842 instances and 14 features, and it is used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 instances and 20 features, and it is used to predict an individual's credit risk (good or bad).

3. **Lending Club Dataset**: This dataset has 10,000 instances and 55 features, and it is used to predict loan decisions based on whether an individual will repay their loan.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UCI Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. 2017. UCI Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark T Keane, Eoin M Kenny, Eoin Delaney, and Barry Smyth. 2021. If only we had better counterfactual explanations: Five key deficits to rectify in the evaluation of counterfactual XAI techniques. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.01035 (2021).

- For the **Lending Club Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lending Club. 2007. Lending Club dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
