To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Reinforcement Learning with Complex Synapses" by Christos Kaplanis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss experiments involving reinforcement learning agents, but they do not explicitly mention any specific datasets in the abstract or introduction. Therefore, I will focus on the **experimental setup** described in section 3. Here, I will look for any references to environments or tasks that might imply the use of standard datasets or benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using environments such as **Cart-Pole** and **Catcher**, which are standard tasks in reinforcement learning. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather environments where the agents are trained.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references of the environments used. For instance, the paper references the OpenAI Gym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The specific environments mentioned (Cart-Pole and Catcher) are part of this toolkit.

Now, I will compile the relevant information regarding the environments used in the experiments:

1. **Cart-Pole**: This is a classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. It is part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

2. **Catcher**: This is another environment from the OpenAI Gym, where the agent must catch falling objects.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather environments, I will note that the datasets are implicitly defined by the environments used in the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present them in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the environments referenced in the paper.
