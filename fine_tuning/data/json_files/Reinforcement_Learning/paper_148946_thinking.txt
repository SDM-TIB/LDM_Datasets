To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Computational Efficiency in Visual Reinforcement Learning via Stored Embeddings" by Lili Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted across a "diverse set of DeepMind Control environments and Atari games," which suggests that these environments may be the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setups. Here, they specifically mention using the **DeepMind Control Suite** and **Atari games** as benchmarks for their experiments. I will need to confirm if these are indeed datasets or if they refer to environments that utilize specific datasets.

In the **background section** (Section 3), the authors discuss the formulation of visual control tasks as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and mention the use of pixel observations from these environments. This reinforces the idea that the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari games are the primary datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation is:
   > Tassa, Yuval, Doron, Yotam, Muldal, Alistair, Erez, Tom, Li, Yazhe, Casas, Diego de Las, Budden, David, Abdolmaleki, Abbas, Merel, Josh, Lefrancq, Andrew, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

2. **Atari Games**: The citation is:
   > Bellemare, Marc G, Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **DeepMind Control Suite** with the citation provided above.
- **Atari Games** with the citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
