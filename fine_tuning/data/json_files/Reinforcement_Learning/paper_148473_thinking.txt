To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POLY-HOOT: Monte-Carlo Planning in Continuous Space MDPs with Non-Asymptotic Analysis" by Weichao Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets that are foundational to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their results, as these often contain concise information about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset and provide its full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details that would be useful for someone looking to understand or utilize the datasets mentioned in the paper.
