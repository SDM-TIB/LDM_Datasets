To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse-to-Fine Q-attention: Efficient Learning for Visual Robotic Manipulation via Discretisation" by Stephen James et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using **RLBench** for simulation experiments, which is a significant dataset for benchmarking robot learning algorithms. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, purpose, and any relevant statistics.

In the **Results section**, the authors state: "For our simulation experiments, we use RLBench." They also mention that RLBench provides a variety of tasks with demonstrations, which indicates that it is a comprehensive dataset for evaluating their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RLBench dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Stephen James, Zicong Ma, David Rovick Arrojo, and Andrew J. Davison. *RLBench: The robot learning benchmark & learning environment*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2020.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the primary focus appears to be on RLBench, as it is the main dataset used for evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for RLBench, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
