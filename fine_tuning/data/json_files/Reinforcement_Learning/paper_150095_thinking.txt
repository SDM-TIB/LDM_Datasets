To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Metaheuristic Based Classifiers for Multiclass Intrusion Detection" by Zareen Fatima and Arshad Ali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the research conducts experiments using two updated attack datasets: **UNSW-NB15** and **CICDDoS2019**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about these datasets. In the experiments section, they describe the **UNSW-NB15 dataset** as containing 175,341 training records and 82,332 testing records, with 10 classes and 45 features. They also mention that it is widely used for feature selection methods evaluation. The **CICDDoS2019 dataset** is described as containing 724,770 records with 12 attacks in the training dataset and 7 in the testing dataset, specifically focusing on DDoS attack types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

For the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, the citation is:
> UNB Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. *[Online] https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html*.

For the **CICDDoS2019 dataset**, the citation is:
> Sharafaldin, I., Lashkari, A. H., Hakak, S., & Ghorbani, A. A. (2019). *Developing realistic distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack dataset and taxonomy*. In 2019 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST), pp. 1-8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
