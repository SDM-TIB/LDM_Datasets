To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Real-World Applications of Personalized Anesthesia Using Policy Constraint Q Learning for Propofol Infusion Control" by Xiuding Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using a "real clinical anesthesia dataset we collected," which suggests that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **methodology section** where the authors describe their data collection process. In **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, the authors mention that they collected data from "6,303 brain-neurological surgeries involving general anesthesia from West China Hospital." This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also note that they filtered the surgeries based on specific criteria, resulting in "1,293 surgeries with 284,281 anesthesia records." This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will provide a description of the dataset along with the authors' names and the context in which it was collected.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Clinical Anesthesia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,303 records from brain-neurological surgeries involving general anesthesia, collected from West China Hospital. After filtering, it includes 1,293 surgeries with a total of 284,281 anesthesia records.

Since this dataset is not published in a separate paper, I will cite it as follows:
> Xiuding Cai, Jiao Chen, Yaoyao Zhu, Beimin Wang, Yu Yao. *Clinical Anesthesia Dataset from West China Hospital*. Unpublished dataset, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation.
