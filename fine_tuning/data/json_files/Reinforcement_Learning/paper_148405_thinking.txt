To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean-Variance Policy Iteration for Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning" by Shangtong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on Mujoco robot simulation tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find specific details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention benchmarking their method on **eight Mujoco robot manipulation tasks**. I will need to identify the names of these tasks to document them properly.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections for any references to datasets or benchmarks that might not have been explicitly mentioned in the experiments section. This could provide additional context or references to datasets used in previous studies.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper discusses Mujoco tasks, I will look for the original Mujoco documentation or relevant papers that describe these tasks.

The Mujoco tasks mentioned in the paper include:
1. **InvertedPendulum-v2**
2. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v2**
3. **HalfCheetah-v2**
4. **Walker2d-v2**
5. **Swimmer-v2**
6. **Hopper-v2**
7. **Reacher-v2**
8. **Ant-v2**

Now, I will find the full citations for the Mujoco tasks. The Mujoco simulator and its tasks are typically referenced in the following way:

- For Mujoco:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026-5033.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
