To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Policies for Width-Based Planning in Pixel Domains" by Miquel Junyent et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

While reading, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details provided by the authors. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to find the original sources or citations for those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment** or specific Atari games as datasets, I will look for the original paper that introduced this environment to provide the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
