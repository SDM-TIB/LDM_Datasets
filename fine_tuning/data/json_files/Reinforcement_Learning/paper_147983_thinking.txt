To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Learning with Q-Matrix Transfer Learning for Novel Fire Evacuation Environment" by Jivitesh Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a fire evacuation environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the fire evacuation environment and the pretraining environment. Here, they detail the structure of the environment and the use of a graph-based model, which indicates that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. The authors may describe the characteristics of the environments, such as the number of rooms, actions, and features like fire spread and bottlenecks, which could imply the existence of datasets.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for validation or comparison with other models. This could provide additional context or specific names of datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "University of Agder Building Model," I will look for the citation that describes this model in detail. If they created a new dataset for their experiments, I will note the details provided in the paper and cite it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
