To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Truly Deterministic Policy Optimization" by Ehsan Saleh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of two novel robotic control environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments in detail, including the environments used for testing their method. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or environments that are used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors describe two environments:
1. **Simple Pendulum with Non-Local Rewards**: This environment is characterized by a reward function that penalizes deviations from a desired oscillation frequency and amplitude. However, it does not specify a publicly available dataset but rather describes the environment setup.
2. **Robotic Leg Environment**: Similar to the pendulum, this environment is described in detail, including the dynamics and reward structure, but again does not reference a specific dataset.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them, I will check the **References section** to see if any related works are cited that might provide datasets or further context. 

In the references, I find several papers related to reinforcement learning and robotic control, but none of them seem to directly provide datasets. The authors primarily focus on their proposed method and the environments they created for their experiments.

Given that no specific datasets are mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments, and thus there are no dataset citations to extract.

In summary, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the authors did not reference any external datasets, focusing instead on their own experimental environments. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.
