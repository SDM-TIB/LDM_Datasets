To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Too Big, so Fail? – Enabling Neural Construction Methods to Solve Large-Scale Routing Problems" by Jonas K. Falkner and Lars Schmidt-Thieme, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four datasets of varying distributions and modalities**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they mention evaluating their method on the **Uchoa benchmark dataset** and their own dataset consisting of mixed uniform and clustered coordinate data. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **Uchoa Benchmark Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for evaluating vehicle routing problems. The authors reference it as a standard benchmark in their experiments.
2. **Custom Dataset**: The authors describe their own dataset, which consists of mixed uniform and clustered coordinate data with sizes ranging from 500 to 4000 customer nodes. They explain the generation process, including the use of Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering and uniform sampling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
- For the **Uchoa benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Uchoa, D. Pecin, A. Pessoa, M. Poggi, T. Vidal, and A. Subramanian. *New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem*. European Journal of Operational Research, 257(3):845–858, 2017.

- For the **custom dataset**, since it is generated by the authors and not a standard dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe its generation process as outlined in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
