To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A step towards a reinforcement learning de novo genome assembler" by Kleber Padovani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **23 new environments** that are freely available, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section**, which provides a detailed description of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, sizes, and characteristics of each dataset. The paper lists **18 datasets** produced by Xavier et al. and **5 novel datasets** derived from other microgenomes.

I will extract the following datasets:

1. **18 datasets from Xavier et al.**: These datasets were generated from microgenomes of Escherichia coli, with varying sizes and read counts. The first dataset corresponds to a set of 10 reads with 8bp from a 25bp microgenome, and the subsequent datasets are variations based on different microgenome sizes and read lengths.

2. **5 novel datasets**: These datasets are derived from larger fragments of previously annotated genes from Escherichia coli. The paper specifies that these datasets are not arbitrary but represent meaningful genomic data.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the datasets produced by Xavier et al., I will refer to:
  > Roberto Xavier, Kleber Padovani de Souza, Annie Chateau, and Ronnie Alves. *Genome assembly using reinforcement learning*. In Luis Kowada and Daniel de Oliveira, editors, Advances in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, pages 16â€“28. Springer International Publishing, 2020.

- For the original datasets and methods used in the seminal approach, I will refer to:
  > Maria-Iuliana Bocicor, Gabriela Czibula, and Istvan-Gergely Czibula. *A reinforcement learning approach for solving the fragment assembly problem*. In 2011 13th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing. IEEE, September 2011.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
