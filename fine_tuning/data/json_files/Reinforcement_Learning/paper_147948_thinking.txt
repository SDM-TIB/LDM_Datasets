To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zap Q-Learning for Optimal Stopping Time Problems" by Shuhang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and methods, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors may have used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, as well as any relevant statistics or descriptions that can help in understanding their context.

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will review it to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on the datasets. This can provide additional insights into the datasets' significance and how they contribute to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will ensure that I note down the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, complete with proper citations for each one.
