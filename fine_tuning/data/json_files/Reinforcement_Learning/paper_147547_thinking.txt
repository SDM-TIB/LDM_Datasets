To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep reinforcement learning for time series: playing idealized trading games" by Xiang Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two idealized trading games: **Univariate** and **Bivariate**. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will examine the **Games** section, particularly **section 2.1 (Overview)**, where the author describes the two games in detail. The Univariate game uses an artificially generated wave-like price time series, while the Bivariate game uses two time series: a random stepwise price time series and a noisy leading signal time series. However, these descriptions do not reference any existing datasets; they describe the generation of synthetic data for the experiments.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but instead relies on artificially generated inputs, I will note that down. The paper does not provide any specific datasets from external sources, which means I won't be able to provide full citations for datasets as they do not exist in this context.

I will also check the **References section** to ensure that there are no overlooked datasets or references that might indicate the use of external datasets. However, based on the content of the paper, it appears that all data used for the experiments is synthetic and generated by the authors.

In summary, I will document the two types of datasets described in the paper, noting that they are not sourced from external references but are instead artificially generated for the purpose of the study. Since there are no full citations for datasets, I will indicate that no external datasets were used.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
