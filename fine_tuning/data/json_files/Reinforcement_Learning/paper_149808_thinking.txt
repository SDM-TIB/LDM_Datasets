To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Returns Using the Hurst Exponent and Q Learning on Momentum and Mean Reversion Strategies" by Yejun (Andrew) Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of the Hurst exponent and Q-learning in trading strategies, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the characteristics of momentum and mean reversion strategies, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **methods section** to see if any datasets are referenced there.

In **section 3.1 (Methods)**, the authors describe their approach to compiling a list of stocks from Nasdaq's stock screener, which indicates that they used a dataset of stock prices. They mention filtering stocks based on market capitalization and downloading daily time series closing price data for nearly 1800 Nasdaq stocks. This suggests that the dataset used is the daily closing prices of Nasdaq stocks for the year 2021.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **results section**. The authors present results based on the trading strategies applied to the stocks they analyzed, but they do not introduce any new datasets here.

Finally, I will check the **citations and references section** to find any relevant studies or datasets that may have been used in their analysis. The references include various studies on trading strategies and the Hurst exponent, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Based on my findings, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Nasdaq Stock Prices Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily time series closing price data for nearly 1800 Nasdaq stocks for the year 2021. The authors filtered stocks with a market capitalization of over $2 billion to avoid penny stocks and ensure data completeness.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the Nasdaq Stock Prices Dataset, while there is no specific citation provided in the paper, I will reference the source of the data:
  > Nasdaq, Inc. (2021). Nasdaq Stock Market Data. Available at: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks

I will ensure to format the dataset entry appropriately for any further processing or review.
