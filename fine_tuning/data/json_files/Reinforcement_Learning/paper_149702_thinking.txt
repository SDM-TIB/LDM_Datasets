To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Few-Shot NAS with Gradient Matching" by Shoukang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors refer to datasets such as **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Here are the datasets I will extract along with their citations:

1. **CIFAR-10**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

3. **ImageNet**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
