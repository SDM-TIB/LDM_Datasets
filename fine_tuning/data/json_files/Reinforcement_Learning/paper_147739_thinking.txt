To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Optimization With Penalized Point Probability Distance: An Alternative To Proximal Policy Optimization" by Xiangxiang Chu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, POP3D, is evaluated on common benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the author typically describes the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the author states that POP3D is evaluated on **49 Atari games** and **7 Mujoco environments**. This indicates that these two sets of environments serve as the datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. The Atari games and Mujoco environments are well-known datasets in the reinforcement learning community, and their citations can be found in the references:

1. For the **Atari games**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. For the **Mujoco environments**, the citation is:
   > Timothy P. Lillicrap, Jonathan J. Hunt, Alexander Pritzel, Nicolas Heess, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, David Silver, and Daan Wierstra. *Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.02971, 2015.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Atari Games**: A collection of 49 games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Mujoco Environments**: A set of 7 continuous control tasks used for benchmarking reinforcement learning methods.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
