To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Targeted Query-based Action-Space Adversarial Policies on Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Xian Yeow Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, such as the environments used for testing the reinforcement learning agents.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional context or details about the datasets, including performance metrics or comparisons that might indicate the datasets' significance in the study. This section may also provide insights into how the datasets were processed or any modifications made for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Point-Goal Environment**: This dataset is used for testing the nominal policy (πnom) and adversarial policy (πadv) in a simulated environment where the RL agent navigates to a randomly generated goal.

2. **Car-Goal Environment**: Similar to the Point-Goal environment, this dataset presents a more complex task for the RL agent, involving navigation with more intricate dynamics.

I will then compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Point-Goal and Car-Goal environments**, the citation is:
  > Alex Ray, Joshua Achiam, and Dario Amodei. *Benchmarking safe exploration in deep reinforcement learning*. 2019.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
