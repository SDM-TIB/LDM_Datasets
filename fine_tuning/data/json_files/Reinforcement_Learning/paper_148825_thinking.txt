To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA Real Traffic Scenarios – novel training ground and benchmark for autonomous driving" by Błażej Osiński et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the CARLA Real Traffic Scenarios (CRTS) and indicates that it is based on real-world traffic data, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (CARLA Real Traffic Scenarios)**, where the authors describe the datasets used to create the interactive scenarios. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **NGSIM Dataset**: This dataset is used for lane change maneuvers on highways. The authors state that it contains vehicle trajectories collected on American highways over 90 minutes of recordings.

2. **openDD Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for roundabout maneuvers and is described as a large-scale trajectory dataset recorded from a bird’s-eye view, containing over 84,000 trajectories distilled from 62 hours of video data.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the NGSIM and openDD datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NGSIM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. *Next generation simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectories and supporting data*, 2016.

- For the **openDD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Breuer, J.-A. Termöhlen, S. Homoceanu, and T. Fingscheidt. *openDD: A large-scale roundabout drone dataset*. In 2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pages 1–6, 2020.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This will prepare me for the next step of structuring the dataset information appropriately for further use or analysis.
