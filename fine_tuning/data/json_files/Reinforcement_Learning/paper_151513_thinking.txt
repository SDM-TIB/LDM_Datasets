To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VOICE: Variance of Induced Contrastive Explanations to Quantify Uncertainty in Neural Network Interpretability" by M. Prabhushankar and G. AlRegib, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors support their observations on **two datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. In this paper, the authors refer to using **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10C** datasets for their experiments. 

1. **ImageNet**: This is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories. The authors likely used it to evaluate their proposed uncertainty quantification methods.

2. **CIFAR-10C**: This dataset is a variant of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes images that have been corrupted with various types of noise and distortions. The authors mention using this dataset to benchmark their VOICE uncertainty metrics against different challenges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10C**, the citation is:
  > D. Hendrycks and T. Dietterich. "Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations." arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
