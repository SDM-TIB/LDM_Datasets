To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGILE: A Novel Framework of LLM Agents" by Peiyuan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset called **ProductQA**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in complex question answering. They specifically mention the **ProductQA** dataset, which consists of 88,229 question-answer pairs in customer service divided into 26 QA tasks.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection titled **3 The ProductQA dataset**, the authors provide detailed information about how the ProductQA dataset was constructed, including the number of question-answer pairs and the types of questions included (Fact-QA, Search-QA, and Reasoning-QA). This section confirms the significance of the ProductQA dataset in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset, **MedMCQA**, in the context of their experiments. This dataset is used for multiple-choice question answering and consists of questions from medical school entrance examinations.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ProductQA**:
   - The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in detail in the paper. I will note that it is a novel dataset created by the authors for their research.

2. **MedMCQA**:
   - The citation for MedMCQA is:
     > Ankit Pal, Logesh Kumar Umapathi, and Malaikannan Sankarasubbu. *MedMCQA: A large-scale multi-subject multi-choice dataset for medical domain question answering*. In Conference on health, inference, and learning, pages 248â€“260. PMLR, 2022.

After identifying these datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
