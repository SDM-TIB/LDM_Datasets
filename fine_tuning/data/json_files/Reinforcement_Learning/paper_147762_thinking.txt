To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Derivation Of Formulas Using Reinforcement Learning" by MinZhong Luo and Li Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets or training sets. The abstract mentions the creation of an "automatic derivation machine" and discusses the use of a "derivation training set," which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **implementation** sections, particularly focusing on any parts that describe the training process or datasets used for reinforcement learning. In this paper, the authors mention constructing a training set for first-order linear differential equations, which indicates that there is a dataset involved in the training of their model.

I will look for specific details about the training set in the **section 6 (Problem Examples)**, where they describe the construction of a training set for the first-order linear differential equation. The authors state that the training set \( D = (X_i, y_i) \) is constructed using equation inference examples containing various functions. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a publicly available dataset or provide a citation for the training set, I will note that the authors have created their own dataset for the purpose of their research. I will summarize this as follows:

1. **First-order Linear Differential Equation Training Set**: This dataset is constructed by the authors and includes various functions used for training the automatic derivation machine. The specific details of the dataset construction are not provided, and it appears to be a custom dataset created for the experiments in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring to note that there are no external datasets cited in the paper. The lack of external dataset citations means I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as typically required.

In summary, I will document the following:

- **First-order Linear Differential Equation Training Set**: Custom dataset created by the authors for training their model, details not specified.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for any dataset references and documented them appropriately, even if they are not formally cited.
