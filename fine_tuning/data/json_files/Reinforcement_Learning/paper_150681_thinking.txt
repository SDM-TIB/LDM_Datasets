To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring and Mitigating Interference in Reinforcement Learning" by Vincent Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on measuring interference in reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several classic control environments, specifically **Cartpole** and **Acrobot**, as part of their experiments. These environments are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. Since these environments are widely recognized, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets, but I will provide the relevant references to the OpenAI Gym, which hosts these environments.

The citations I will include are:

- For **Cartpole** and **Acrobot**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
