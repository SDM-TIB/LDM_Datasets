To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Phonotactics Affect Multilingual and Zero-Shot ASR Performance" by Siyuan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of ASR systems across multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the databases used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two main corpora:

1. **GlobalPhone**: This corpus is characterized by a smaller number of recordings and limited noise and reverberation. It is used for training and evaluation across various languages.

2. **IARPA Babel**: This corpus contains more hours of training data and is noted for its challenging recognition conditions due to more naturalistic recording environments.

The authors provide a detailed table (Table 1) that lists the specific languages included in their experiments, along with the training and evaluation hours for each language. This table is crucial for understanding the scope of the datasets used.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **GlobalPhone**, the citation is:
  > T. Schultz, “Globalphone: a multilingual speech and text database developed at Karlsruhe University,” in Proc. INTERSPEECH, 2002.

- For **IARPA Babel**, the citation is:
  > IARPA Babel Program. “IARPA Babel Program,” available at: https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/babel.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that accurately reflects the datasets used in the study, ready for further analysis or processing.
