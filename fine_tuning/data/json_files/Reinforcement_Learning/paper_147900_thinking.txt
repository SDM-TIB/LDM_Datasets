To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Edge Caching via Reinforcement Learning in Fog Radio Access Networks" by Liuyang Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets or benchmarks used in their research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant metrics. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology** and **results** sections for any references to datasets used in simulations or experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their experiments, which can provide valuable information.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this specific paper, I will look for any datasets related to the **spatio-temporal content popularity** and **user preference** models mentioned in the introduction and methodology. I will also check if there are any references to existing datasets used for benchmarking the proposed methods.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments for detailed descriptions.
3. Check the methodology and results sections for any additional dataset references.
4. Retrieve full citations from the References section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the information in a clear and organized manner for future reference.
