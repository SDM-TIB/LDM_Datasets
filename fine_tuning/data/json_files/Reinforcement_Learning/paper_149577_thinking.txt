To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recursive Least Squares Advantage Actor-Critic Algorithms" by Yuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their algorithms. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithms on **40 games in the Atari 2600 environment** and **11 tasks in the MuJoCo environment**. These environments are well-known benchmarks in the field of reinforcement learning, and I will need to document them as datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. For the Atari 2600 environment, I will refer to the original source that introduced this benchmark, which is:

- For the **Atari 2600 environment**:
  > V. Mnih et al., “Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning,” *Nature*, vol. 518, pp. 529-533, 2015.

- For the **MuJoCo environment**:
  > E. Todorov, S. E. Tassa, and D. A. Abbeel, “Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control,” *2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*, pp. 5026-5033, 2012.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its characteristics, and the corresponding citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
