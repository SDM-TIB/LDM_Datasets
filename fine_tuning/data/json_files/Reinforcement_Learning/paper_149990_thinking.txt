To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Offline Policy Optimization for Large Scale Recommendation" by Otmane Sakhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the optimization of recommender systems, but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experimental results for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the context of their work but do not provide specific dataset names. However, in the **experimental results section**, they describe their experiments using two collaborative filtering datasets: **Twitch** and **GoodReads**. 

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the statistics of the datasets after processing:

1. **Twitch Dataset**: 
   - Catalog size: 790K
   - Number of users: 500K

2. **GoodReads Dataset**: 
   - Catalog size: 2.33M
   - Number of users: 300K

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **Twitch dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rappaz, J.; McAuley, J.; and Aberer, K. (2021). *Recommendation on Live-Streaming Platforms: Dynamic Availability and Repeat Consumption*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 390–399. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery.

- For the **GoodReads dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wan, M.; and McAuley, J. J. (2018). *Item recommendation on monotonic behavior chains*. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys 2018, 86–94. ACM.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
