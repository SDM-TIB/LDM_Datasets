To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Policy Adaptation During Deployment" by Nicklas Hansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that empirical evaluations are performed on diverse simulation environments from the **DeepMind Control suite** and **ViZDoom**, which suggests that these environments may be considered datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, particularly in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, they mention using environments from the **DeepMind Control suite** and **CRLMaze** for their evaluations.

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This is a collection of continuous control tasks where agents observe raw pixels. The paper cites the following reference for this suite:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., & Riedmiller, M. (2018). *DeepMind control suite*. Technical report, DeepMind.

2. **CRLMaze**: This is a time-constrained, discrete-action 3D navigation task for ViZDoom. The authors reference the following paper for CRLMaze:
   > Lomonaco, V., Desai, K., Culurciello, E., & Maltoni, D. (2019). *Continual reinforcement learning in 3D non-stationary environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10112.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics as described in the paper. The **DeepMind Control suite** is characterized by its diverse real-world tasks for motor control, while **CRLMaze** is noted for its navigation tasks with novel textures and lighting.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper. This will ensure that I have the complete and accurate information needed for proper citation.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into the required output structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
