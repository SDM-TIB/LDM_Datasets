To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithms for Starshade Retargeting in Space-Based Telescopes" by Ho Chit Siu and Victor Pankratius, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may provide context or mention datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses any specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of observations, types of data collected, or any unique features that distinguish them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows for verification and further exploration of the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Exo-S Target List," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is derived from a previous study, I will ensure to cite that original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any subsequent processing or review.
