To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Strong Baseline for Point Cloud Registration via Direct Superpoints Matching" by Aniket Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved results on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss their approach and mention that they run experiments on three benchmark datasets. This is a good indication that the datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets: **ModelNet**, **3DMatch**, and **KITTI**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about each dataset.

In the **ModelNet** subsection, the authors describe it as a synthetic dataset comprising CAD models. They mention that they follow specific benchmark settings for evaluation.

In the **3DMatch** subsection, the authors describe it as a collection of 62 scenes, specifying how they split the dataset for training, testing, and validation.

In the **KITTI** subsection, they mention that it consists of outdoor driving scenarios scanned using a LiDAR sensor, and they specify how they use certain sequences for training and testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. 

For **ModelNet**, the citation is:

For **3DMatch**, the citation is:
> Zeng, A., Song, S., NieÃŸner, M., Fisher, M., Xiao, J., & Funkhouser, T. (2017). 3DMatch: Learning Local Geometric Descriptors from RGB-D Reconstructions. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

For **KITTI**, the citation is:
> Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
