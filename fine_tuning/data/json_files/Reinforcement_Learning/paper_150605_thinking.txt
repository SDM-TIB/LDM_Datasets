To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy-Based Self-Competition for Planning Problems" by Jonathan Pirnay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two combinatorial optimization problems: the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and the **Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)**. This indicates that datasets related to these problems might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they train the agent on randomly generated instances for both TSP and JSSP, which suggests that these instances serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors refer to benchmark instances for JSSP from the Taillard benchmark set, which is a well-known dataset for job-shop scheduling problems. 

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: The paper mentions that the agent is trained on randomly generated instances of TSP, specifically focusing on the two-dimensional Euclidean case in the unit square. However, no specific citation is provided for the dataset since it is generated randomly.

2. **Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)**: The authors refer to the Taillard benchmark set for JSSP, which consists of 10 instances for each problem size. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 64(2), 278-285.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

- For **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, since it is generated randomly, I will note that no formal citation exists.
- For **Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)**, I will include the citation provided above.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly articulated and ready for any structured output format that may be required later.
