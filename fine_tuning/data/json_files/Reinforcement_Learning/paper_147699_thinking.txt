To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ziyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed dueling architecture on the **Atari 2600 domain**, which suggests that datasets related to Atari games are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors typically outline the experimental setup, including the specific datasets employed for training and evaluation. 

In the **experiments section**, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. For instance, if the authors describe their evaluation on the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which consists of 57 Atari games, I will note this as a significant dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as specific Atari games that may have been used in the experiments. Each game can be considered a part of the ALE dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and well-documented.
