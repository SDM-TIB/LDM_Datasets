To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Bayesian Sparse Networks with Full Experience Replay for Continual Learning" by Dong Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 10 classes, with 5,000 training examples and 1,000 test examples per class.
2. **Tiny ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet containing 200 classes, each with 500 training examples.
3. **Permuted MNIST**: A variant of the MNIST dataset where the pixels are randomly permuted.
4. **Rotated MNIST**: Another variant of MNIST where the images are rotated by random angles.
5. **MNIST-360**: A dataset designed for general continual learning, where batches of two consecutive digits are presented at a time.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **Tiny ImageNet**: 
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- **Permuted MNIST**: 
  > Matthias Delange et al. *A continual learning survey: Defying forgetting in classification tasks*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2021.

- **Rotated MNIST**: 
  > Similar to Permuted MNIST, this dataset is often referenced in continual learning literature.

- **MNIST-360**: 
  > Pietro Buzzega et al. *Dark experience for general continual learning: a strong, simple baseline*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 15920â€“15930, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
