To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jailbroken: How Does LLM Safety Training Fail?" by Alexander Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Background)** and **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation)**, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In section 2.2, the authors mention two specific datasets used for evaluating the vulnerability of safety-trained language models:

1. **Curated Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32 harmful prompts, including 16 examples from OpenAI's GPT-4 technical report and 16 adapted from the red-teaming dataset of Ganguli et al. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's responses to harmful prompts.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset contains 317 harmful prompts generated by GPT-4, constructed to elicit restricted behavior. The authors describe the process of creating this dataset, which involves sampling and filtering prompts to ensure they are challenging for the models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original sources of the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Curated Dataset**, the relevant citation is:
- Ganguli, D., Lovitt, L., Kernion, J., Askell, A., Bai, Y., Kadavath, S., Mann, B., Perez, E., Schiefer, N., Ndousse, K., et al. *Red teaming language models to reduce harms: Methods, scaling behaviors, and lessons learned*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.07858, 2022.

For the **Synthetic Dataset**, the authors reference their own methodology for generating harmful prompts, which does not have a separate citation but is described in detail in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
