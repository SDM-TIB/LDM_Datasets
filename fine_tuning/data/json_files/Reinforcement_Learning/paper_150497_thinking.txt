To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithm Based Combinatorial Optimization for the Optimal Design of Water Distribution Network of Gurudeniya Service Zone, Sri Lanka" by K.H.M.R.N. Senavirathna and C.K. Walgampaya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of water distribution networks (WDNs) and the need for optimal design solutions. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the data requirements for their optimization algorithm. They mention that the data includes:
- Unit costs of commercially available pipe sizes
- Reservoir water head
- Nodal water demands
- Pipe lengths
- Nodal elevations
- Pipe connectivity layout

This indicates that the authors have compiled a dataset based on these parameters, but I need to find specific references to the data sources.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide lengths of pipes used in the Gurudeniya WDN, which is a specific dataset. The table lists the pipe identifiers and their corresponding lengths in meters.

In **Table 2**, the authors present nodal water demand and elevation data, which is another dataset. This table includes node identifiers, their respective demands in cubic meters per day, and elevations in meters.

**Table 3** contains commercially available pipe sizes and their corresponding unit costs, which is also a dataset relevant to the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to data collected from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB), Sri Lanka, which is a key source for their datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Pipe Lengths Dataset**:
   > Senavirathna, K.H.M.R.N., & Walgampaya, C.K. (2022). Use of Honey-Bee Mating Optimization Algorithm to Design Water Distribution Network in Gurudeniya Service Zone, Gurudeniya, Sri Lanka. *Engineer: Journal of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka*, 55(01), 105-114.

2. **Nodal Water Demand and Elevation Dataset**:
   > Senavirathna, K.H.M.R.N., & Walgampaya, C.K. (2022). Use of Honey-Bee Mating Optimization Algorithm to Design Water Distribution Network in Gurudeniya Service Zone, Gurudeniya, Sri Lanka. *Engineer: Journal of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka*, 55(01), 105-114.

3. **Commercially Available Pipe Sizes and Costs Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
