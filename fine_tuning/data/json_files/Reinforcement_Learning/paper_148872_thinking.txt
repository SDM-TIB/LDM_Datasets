To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OffCon3: What is State-of-the-Art Anyway?" by Philip J. Ball and Stephen J. Roberts, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors discuss two algorithms, SAC and TD3, and their performance on various environments. I will check if they mention any specific datasets or benchmarks used for testing these algorithms. If they refer to standard environments like OpenAI Gym, I will note that these environments are widely recognized datasets in the reinforcement learning community.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the OpenAI Gym environments, I will look for the citation:
> Greg Brockman et al. "OpenAI Gym." 2016. eprint: arXiv:1606.01540.

If they refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to find their respective citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
