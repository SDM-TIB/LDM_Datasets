To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing the issue of stochastic environments and local decision-making in multi-objective reinforcement learning" by Kewen Ding, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets that may have been used in prior studies or that are relevant to the research context. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may highlight key datasets that are foundational to the work.

I will then look into the **methodology section**, as this is where the author typically describes the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the algorithms. This section may provide specific details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the author discusses the performance of the algorithms on specific datasets. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the experiments and may confirm their relevance to the research findings.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will look for full citations of any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to document the following for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its associated details, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete for future reference.
