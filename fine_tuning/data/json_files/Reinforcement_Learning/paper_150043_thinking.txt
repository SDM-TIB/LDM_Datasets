To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pathfinding in Random Partially Observable Environments with Vision-Informed Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Anthony Dowling, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Seeker Environment)**, where the author describes the environment used for training the reinforcement learning models. This section is likely to contain details about the dataset or environment configurations used for training.

In this section, the author mentions the creation of a "Seeker" environment, which is a simulated gridworld environment designed for training models. However, it does not appear to reference any external datasets but rather describes a custom environment generated for the study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is the "Seeker environment," which is a synthetic dataset created by the author.

I will also check the **experiments and evaluation sections** to see if any additional datasets or benchmarks are mentioned. However, it seems that the focus is primarily on the Seeker environment and the performance of different models trained within it.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to ensure that I capture any relevant citations that may pertain to the methodologies or environments referenced in the paper. However, since the Seeker environment is a novel contribution of this work, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the "Seeker environment," which is a custom environment created for the purpose of this research. Since it does not have an external citation, I will note that it is an original contribution of the author.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
