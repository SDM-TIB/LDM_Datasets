To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survival probability and size of lineages in antibody affinity maturation" by Marco Molari, Rémi Monasson, and Simona Cocco, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets used in the study. This section often outlines the background and context, which may include datasets that are foundational to the research.

I will then focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental design and data collection processes. This section may contain detailed information about the datasets, including how they were obtained, their size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that summarize the data collected. This section often presents the findings in relation to the datasets, which can provide insights into their structure and content.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I will identify the datasets and compile their descriptions, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will provide the citation as follows:

- For **Penn Action Dataset**:
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
