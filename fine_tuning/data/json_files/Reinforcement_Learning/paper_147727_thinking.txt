To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning optimization in a multi-agents system for image segmentation" by Issam Qaffou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in computer vision but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for testing. In this section, they mention using a **database containing 100 different images**, each with its ground truth, which is an image manually segmented by an expert. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details about it.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **methodology** or **implementation sections**. The authors describe the phases of processing and the operators used, but they do not provide a formal name for the dataset. However, they do mention that the images are closely similar in their features, which suggests that the dataset is curated for the segmentation task.

Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset or a formal citation, I will note that the dataset consists of 100 images with corresponding ground truths, but I cannot provide a full citation as it is not explicitly referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works relate to the dataset used. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works rather than datasets.

In conclusion, I will document the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Not explicitly named in the paper, referred to as a database of 100 images with ground truths.
- **Description**: A collection of 100 different images used for image segmentation tasks, each accompanied by a manually segmented ground truth image.

Since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset used for the experiments in this study.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
