To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streaming Linear System Identification with Reverse Experience Replay" by Prateek Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

I will then examine the **methodology or experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar headings. Here, I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation. This will facilitate easy access and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ready for presentation or further analysis.
