To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DF2AM: Dual-level Feature Fusion and Affinity Modeling for RGB-Infrared Cross-modality Person Re-identification" by Junhui Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on two widely used cross-modality re-ID datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be named.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4.1)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that their method is evaluated on **SYSU-MM01** and **RegDB** datasets. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to extract.

In the **datasets description**, the authors provide details about each dataset:
1. **SYSU-MM01**: This dataset contains images of 419 identities captured in both indoor and outdoor environments, with a training set of 22,258 RGB images and 11,909 IR images. The testing set includes 96 identities, with 3,803 IR images for the query and 301 RGB images for the gallery set.

2. **RegDB**: This dataset consists of 412 persons and 8,240 images, where each person has 10 RGB images and 10 IR images. The training set has 4,120 images of 206 persons, while the testing set includes images of the remaining 206 persons.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SYSU-MM01**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Ancong, Wei-Shi Zheng, Hong-Xing Yu, Shaogang Gong, and Jianhuang Lai. "RGB-infrared cross-modality person re-identification." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5380â€“5389, 2017.

- For **RegDB**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, Dat Tien, Hyung Gil Hong, Ki Wan Kim, and Kang Ryoung Park. "Person recognition system based on a combination of body images from visible light and thermal cameras." Sensors, 17(3):605, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
