To extract datasets from the research paper titled "First-Order Problem Solving through Neural MCTS based Reinforcement Learning" by Ruiyang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that describe the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a specific problem, the **HSR (Highest Safe Rung) problem**, which is used as the experimental subject. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets but rather describe the problem in terms of its parameters (k, q, n). This indicates that the dataset is generated based on the problem's parameters rather than being sourced from an external repository.

Since there are no traditional datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors have created a problem-specific dataset rather than using established datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none referenced in the conventional sense.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or related datasets are mentioned that could be relevant to the methodology or the problem being solved. I will look for any papers that might have introduced datasets or benchmarks that are commonly used in the context of combinatorial optimization or reinforcement learning.

After reviewing the references, I find several papers that could be relevant, but they do not directly correspond to datasets used in the experiments of this paper. Instead, they provide context or foundational algorithms that the authors build upon.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
1. The paper does not utilize any external datasets but rather focuses on a combinatorial problem (HSR) that is defined by its parameters.
2. There are no full citations for datasets as none are explicitly used or referenced in the traditional sense.
3. I will note the relevant references that provide context for the methodologies discussed in the paper, even though they do not correspond to datasets.

This approach ensures that I accurately reflect the content of the paper while adhering to the requirement of providing full citations where applicable, even if no datasets are explicitly mentioned.
