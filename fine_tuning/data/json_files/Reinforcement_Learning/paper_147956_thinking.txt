To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning" by Shauharda Khadka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on "a range of continuous control benchmarks," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in the context of continuous control tasks on Mujoco, which is a physics engine. This indicates that Mujoco environments are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **results** section to confirm the specific Mujoco tasks they evaluated their method on. The paper mentions five continuous control tasks: **Humanoid, Hopper, Swimmer, HalfCheetah, and Walker2D**. These tasks are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. Since Mujoco is a widely recognized physics engine and the tasks are standard benchmarks, I will refer to the original Mujoco paper for citation:

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In *Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on* (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

Next, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format. Each dataset will include its name, a brief description, and the full citation.

1. **Humanoid**: A continuous control task where the goal is to make a 3D humanoid robot walk and run.
2. **Hopper**: A continuous control task where the objective is to make a one-legged robot hop forward.
3. **Swimmer**: A continuous control task where the goal is to make a 2D swimmer move through water.
4. **HalfCheetah**: A continuous control task where the objective is to make a 2D cheetah robot run as fast as possible.
5. **Walker2D**: A continuous control task where the goal is to make a 2D bipedal robot walk.

Now, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each of these tasks, which are all part of the Mujoco environment.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
