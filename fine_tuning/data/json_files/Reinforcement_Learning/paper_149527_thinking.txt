To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Power Flow with Renewables Using Spatial-Temporal Graph Information" by Jinhao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used for validation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors may discuss the context of their research and mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains information about the data sources, characteristics of the datasets, and how they were utilized in the study.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide additional details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any preprocessing steps taken before analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to power systems, possibly including modified IEEE bus systems or other relevant datasets for evaluating their deep reinforcement learning approach.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
