To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Co-operative Congestion Mitigation" by Aamir Hasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA simulator and the Flow framework for evaluating driving policies, which suggests that these tools may involve datasets or simulation environments.

Next, I will look into the **Method section**, particularly focusing on the parts that describe the simulation setup and the experiments. Here, the authors mention using the CARLA simulator and the Flow framework, but I need to determine if they reference any specific datasets or data sources used in their experiments.

In the **Study Procedure and Setup section**, the authors describe their user study and the simulation environment. They mention recruiting participants and conducting trials, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Instead, they focus on the simulation framework and the experimental design.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to their study. The authors reference several papers, including one by Sridhar and Wu, which discusses piecewise constant policies for congestion mitigation. This paper may contain information about datasets used in their experiments.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the relevant citations for the tools and frameworks mentioned in the paper, as they may serve as datasets or data sources for the research:

1. **CARLA Simulator**:

2. **Flow Framework**: 
   > Wu, C., Kreidieh, A. R., Parvate, K., Vinitsky, E., & Bayen, A. M. (2021). *Flow: A modular learning framework for mixed autonomy traffic*. IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

3. **SUMO Simulator**: 
   > Lopez, P. A., Behrisch, M., Bieker-Walz, L., Erdmann, J., Flötteröd, Y.-P., Hilbrich, R., Lücken, L., Rummel, J., Wagner, P., & Wießner, E. (2018). *Microscopic traffic simulation using SUMO*. In The 21st IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather discusses simulation environments and frameworks, I will note that the datasets are derived from the simulations conducted using CARLA and Flow, rather than traditional datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to document the information in the required format, ensuring that I include full citations for the tools and frameworks mentioned in the paper.
