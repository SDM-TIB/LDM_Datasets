To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Î»-MODELS: EFFECTIVE DECISION-AWARE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH LATENT MODELS" by Claas Voelcker et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using environments from the **DMC suite (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020)**, specifically the **Walker-run, Quadruped-run, and Humanoid-run** environments. These are key datasets for their experiments, and I will note their significance in the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **DMC suite**:
   > Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *dm_control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
