To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Langevin DQN" by Vikranth Dwaracherla and Benjamin Van Roy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **deep sea environment** for their computational experiments. I will look for any references to datasets or environments that are used in conjunction with this term. 

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets.

For the **deep sea environment**, I will note that it is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted to evaluate the Langevin DQN algorithm. The authors cite previous works that describe this environment, which will help in constructing the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of any datasets or environments mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
