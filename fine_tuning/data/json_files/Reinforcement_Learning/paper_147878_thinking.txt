To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combinational Q-Learning for Dou Di Zhu" by Yang You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources used in their research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their approach to the card game Dou Di Zhu and mention that they developed a card game environment. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they describe the game mechanics and the training of agents, which suggests that the data used is generated from the game itself rather than sourced from an external dataset.

Since there are no external datasets mentioned, I will also check the **references section** to see if any foundational works or related datasets are cited that could be relevant to the study. This may include previous research on Dou Di Zhu or related card games that could provide context or data sources.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile any relevant information regarding datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations if applicable. If no datasets are found, I will note that the research primarily relies on a self-generated dataset from the game environment.

Finally, I will ensure that any citations for datasets or related works are formatted correctly, as providing full citations is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for specific datasets used.
3. Check the references for any relevant citations.
4. Compile the findings, ensuring to include full citations where applicable.
