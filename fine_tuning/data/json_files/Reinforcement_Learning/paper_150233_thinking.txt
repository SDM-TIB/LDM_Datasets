To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VERIX: Towards Verified Explainability of Deep Neural Networks" by Min Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on **image recognition benchmarks** and a **real-world scenario of autonomous aircraft taxiing**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition. The authors mention training a fully-connected feed-forward neural network on this dataset, achieving a high accuracy.

2. **GTSRB Dataset**: The paper discusses using this dataset for traffic sign recognition. The authors specify that they focused on the top 10 categories with the highest occurrence to avoid distribution shifts.

3. **TaxiNet Dataset**: This dataset is used in a real-world application for autonomous aircraft taxiing. The authors describe how they trained a regression model to predict the aircraft's cross-track distance based on images taken from a camera.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For the **GTSRB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition*. Neural Networks, 32:323–332, 2012.

- For the **TaxiNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kyle D Julian, Ritchie Lee, and Mykel J Kochenderfer. *Validation of image-based neural network controllers through adaptive stress testing*. In 2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pages 1–7, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
