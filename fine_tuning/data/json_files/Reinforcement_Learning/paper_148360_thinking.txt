To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for Autonomous Vessels in 2D Environments" by Mohammad Etemad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction might give insights into the context and any datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset creation and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors describe the dataset creation process. Here, they mention that they created a simulated 2D marine environment based on geographical data from NOAA, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used in their experiments.

In this section, the authors specify that they selected a region in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and created a water and land layer using public data on earth elevation. They also mention the use of dynamically generated obstacles during the simulation, which indicates that the dataset is not a traditional static dataset but rather a generated environment for testing their algorithms.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the NOAA dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to it as "public data on earth elevation using the NOAA dataset." I will need to find the complete reference for this dataset, which typically includes the title, authors (if applicable), publication year, and a URL or DOI if available.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the NOAA dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
