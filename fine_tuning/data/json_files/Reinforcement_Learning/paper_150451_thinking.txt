To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CH-Go: Online Go System Based on Chunk Data Storage" by Hui Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the system processes "160k Go game data released by Kiseido Go Server (KGS)," which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of Go and mentions various systems but does not introduce new datasets beyond what is mentioned in the abstract.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for specific details about how the dataset is utilized. The authors describe the processing of "160k Go data" and mention that it is stored in a binary format using NumPy arrays. This reinforces that the KGS dataset is central to their work.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if there are any mentions of other datasets or variations of the KGS dataset. However, the focus remains on the 160k Go game records from KGS, which is used for training and testing the system.

Finally, I will consult the **references** section to find the full citation for the KGS dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the KGS dataset itself, but it is commonly known in the field. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the KGS dataset:

- **Kiseido Go Server (KGS)**: 
  > Kiseido Go Server. *KGS Go Server*. Available at: https://www.gokgs.com/

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Kiseido Go Server (KGS) Go Game Data
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 160,000 Go game records used for training and testing the CH-Go system.
   - **Citation**: Kiseido Go Server. *KGS Go Server*. Available at: https://www.gokgs.com/

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing.
