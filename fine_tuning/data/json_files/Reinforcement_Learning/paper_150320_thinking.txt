To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Action Loss for Proximal Policy Optimization" by Xiulei Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted in **Gym-µRTS** and **MuJoCo**, indicating that these environments are likely associated with datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the environments used. In this section, they explicitly mention using **Gym-µRTS** and **MuJoCo** for their experiments. I will look for any specific dataset details related to these environments.

In the paper, the authors describe **Gym-µRTS** as a small implementation of a real-time strategy game, which provides a discrete action space for training agents. They also mention **MuJoCo**, a physics engine used for continuous action environments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these environments, as they are widely recognized benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will find the relevant citations for both environments:

1. **Gym-µRTS**:
   - Citation:
     > Shengyi Huang, Santiago Onta˜n´on, Chris Bamford, and Lukasz Grela. *Gym-µrts: Toward affordable full game real-time strategy games research with deep reinforcement learning*. In 2021 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG), pp. 1–8, 2021. doi: 10.1109/CoG52621.2021.9619076.

2. **MuJoCo**:
   - Citation:
     > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ international conference on intelligent robots and systems, pp. 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will include the names of the datasets, a brief description of each, and their full citations to ensure proper attribution.
