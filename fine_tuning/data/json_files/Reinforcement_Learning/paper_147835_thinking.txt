To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Urban Driving with Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Changjian Li and Krzysztof Czarnecki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** traffic simulator as the environment for their experiments. However, I need to determine if they refer to any specific datasets derived from this simulator or if they are using it as a tool to generate their own data.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The authors mention SUMO, which is a well-known simulation tool, but I need to confirm if they are using any specific datasets that are publicly available or if they created their own datasets for the experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites the SUMO simulator, which is a key component of their experimental setup. The citation for SUMO is:
> Michael Behrisch, Daniel Krajzewicz, and Melanie Weber (Eds.). *Simulation of Urban Mobility - First International Conference, SUMO 2013, Berlin, Germany, May 15-17, 2013. Revised Selected Papers*. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 8594. Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-45079-6

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of training the reinforcement learning models. If the authors refer to any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will extract their names and corresponding citations as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
