To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models" by Tristan Thrush et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called "I am a Strange Dataset," which indicates that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. I will note this down as it is explicitly named.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (I am a Strange Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they explain the structure of the dataset, which consists of 208 examples designed to test language models on metalinguistic self-reference. They also mention that the dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators.

In this section, I will extract the following details about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: "I am a Strange Dataset"
   - **Description**: A dataset designed to evaluate language models' abilities to generate and understand self-referential statements and metalinguistic capabilities.
   - **Size**: 208 examples, with 200 for evaluation, 3 for few-shot prompts, and 5 for onboarding tasks.
   - **Creation**: Hand-crafted by four expert annotators.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset and evaluation toolkit are available on GitHub, which is a crucial piece of information for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset is:

> Thrush, T., Moore, J., Monares, M., Potts, C., & Kiela, D. (2024). *I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models*. arXiv. Retrieved from https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the dataset, I will compile it into a structured format for clarity. The dataset entry will include the name, description, size, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations before finalizing the output.
