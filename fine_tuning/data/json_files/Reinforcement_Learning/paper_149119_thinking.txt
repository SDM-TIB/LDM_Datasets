To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Out-of-Distribution Problem in Explainability and Search Methods for Feature Importance Explanations" by Peter Hase, Harry Xie, and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments with **six diverse text classification datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks and consists of pairs of sentences labeled with entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.

2. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no questions that require reasoning over a given context.

3. **FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification)**: This dataset is designed for fact verification tasks, where claims must be verified against a set of documents.

4. **MultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension)**: A dataset that involves reading comprehension tasks with multiple-choice questions based on a passage.

5. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis that contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

6. **Evidence Inference**: A dataset used for inferring evidence from clinical trial reports.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
