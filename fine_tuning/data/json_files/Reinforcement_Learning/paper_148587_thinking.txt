To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compositional Neural Programs for Continuous Control" by Thomas Pierrot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method for learning in sparse-reward continuous control problems, which may imply the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that they trained the self-behavioral model using three datasets made of episodes played with the goal-conditioned policy. Specifically, they state that they used datasets of sizes 10k, 50k, and 100k episodes.

To ensure I capture the full context, I will also check the **supplementary material** for any additional details about the datasets, including how they were generated or any specific characteristics.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **Dataset of 10k episodes**: This dataset is used to train the self-behavioral model. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is derived from the goal-conditioned policy's behavior.

2. **Dataset of 50k episodes**: Similar to the first dataset, this is also used for training the self-behavioral model. Again, no specific citation is provided.

3. **Dataset of 100k episodes**: This dataset is the largest and is used for the same purpose as the previous two. It is also derived from the goal-conditioned policy's behavior without a specific citation.

Since the datasets are generated from the authors' experiments and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are internal datasets created for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the datasets clearly, including their sizes and purposes, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for these datasets.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
