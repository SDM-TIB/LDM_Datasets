To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for the Long-term Short-term Planning on the Frenet Space" by Majid Moghadam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of high-fidelity highway simulations on CARLA, which suggests that CARLA might be a dataset or simulation environment used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides details on the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using **CARLA** as the high-fidelity simulation environment for generating realistic highway traffic scenarios. This indicates that CARLA is a significant component of their dataset for testing the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for CARLA, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the research. The relevant citation for CARLA is:

- **CARLA**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

Since CARLA is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
