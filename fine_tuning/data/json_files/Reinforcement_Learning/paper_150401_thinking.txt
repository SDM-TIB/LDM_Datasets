To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lasting Diversity and Superior Runtime Guarantees for the (Âµ + 1) Genetic Algorithm" by Benjamin Doerr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the abstract or introduction. However, in the **experimental evaluation section**, they refer to the **Jump functions** as the primary focus of their analysis. Since Jump functions are not traditional datasets but rather a class of optimization problems, I will need to check if there are any references to datasets used in conjunction with these functions.

I will also consult the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets or benchmarks that may have been used in the experiments. If the authors refer to any previous works that utilized datasets, I will extract those citations as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned. If no traditional datasets are identified, I will note that the paper primarily focuses on theoretical analysis rather than empirical datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
