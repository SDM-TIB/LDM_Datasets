To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Newton Updating for Large-Scale Distributed Learning" by Shuyuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can indicate the context in which they are used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the background and significance of their work. If they mention any datasets or benchmarks used in their research, I will take note of them.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection methods. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Following that, I will look into the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide additional details about the datasets, such as how they were utilized in the experiments, any preprocessing steps taken, or performance metrics reported.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will check for citations related to the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper:

1. **THU Chinese News Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of real data analysis. It consists of 14 types of Chinese news collected from Sina news from 2005 to 2011. The authors generated a binary response variable based on the news type.

   Full citation:
   > THU Chinese Text Classification Package. Available at: http://thuctc.thunlp.org.

2. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors also describe two simulation examples (logistic regression and Poisson regression) where they generate datasets based on specific statistical models. While these datasets are not publicly available, they are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

   For the logistic regression example, the dataset is generated with a sample size of \(N = 10^6\) and specific parameters for the covariates and response variable.

   For the Poisson regression example, similar parameters are used, but with different settings for the covariates.

Since the simulated datasets do not have formal citations, I will note them as internal datasets used for the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
