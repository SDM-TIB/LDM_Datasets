To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence Results For Q-Learning With Experience Replay" by Liran Szlak and Ohad Shamir, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. These sections usually detail the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay attention to any descriptions of the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets in the context of the results obtained. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their relevance to the findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Atari 2600" or "OpenAI Gym," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a consistent format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
