To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Transformer-Based Action Sequence Generation for Q-Learning" by Gideon Stein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and methods sections are likely to contain more specific details about the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their proposed method in various environments, which may indicate the use of specific datasets. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention training their model on four control environments: **MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, CartPole-v1, and LunarLander-v2**. These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets or environments used in the experiments. The appendix may provide further context or specifications regarding the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The environments used (MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, CartPole-v1, and LunarLander-v2) are part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. URL: https://gym.openai.com/

2. **Atari Environments**: The paper also mentions training on Atari environments, specifically **MsPacman** and **Asteroids**. The citation for the Atari environments is:
   > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., Graves, A., Riedmiller, M., Fidjeland, A. K., Ostrovski, G., et al. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. Nature, 518(7540), 529â€“533.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
