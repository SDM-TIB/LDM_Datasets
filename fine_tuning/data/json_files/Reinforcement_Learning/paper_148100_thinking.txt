To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fixed-Horizon Temporal Difference Methods for Stable Reinforcement Learning" by Kristopher De Asis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and prior work, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically check for any sections that might be labeled as **"Datasets"** or similar, as these sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets that might be mentioned in the context of reinforcement learning experiments. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
