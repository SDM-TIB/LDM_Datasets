To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effects of Memory Replay in Reinforcement Learning" by Ruishan Liu and James Zou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors describe the datasets used to validate their findings. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

As I read through the paper, I will note down any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to standard benchmarks or specific datasets used in their experiments, I will record these names along with any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
