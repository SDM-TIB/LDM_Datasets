To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretation of Black Box NLP Models" by Shivani Choudhary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Interpretability Methods)**, as it is likely to contain specific methodologies that may reference datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors discuss various interpretability methods but do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their analysis. However, they reference several representative papers throughout the text, which may imply the use of datasets in those studies. I will compile a list of these representative papers to identify any datasets they may have utilized.

I will then consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the representative papers mentioned in the text. This is crucial for providing proper attribution to the datasets referenced in those studies.

For example, if a method discussed in the paper is based on a specific dataset from a referenced study, I will ensure to include that dataset's citation. 

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation of the original paper where the dataset was introduced or utilized.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
