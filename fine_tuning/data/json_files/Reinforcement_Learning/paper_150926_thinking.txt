To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDGym: Low-Code Reinforcement Learning Environments using System Dynamics Models" by Emmanuel Klu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of an SD model for the electric vehicle adoption problem, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this topic.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Using SDGym)**, particularly the subsection **4.1 (Comparing PySD and BPTK-Py Simulators)**, where the authors mention using the "Electric Vehicle Popularity in Norway" SD model. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with this model.

In **section 4.1.1 (Environment Setup)**, the authors reference the model developed by Orliuk & Yermolova (2019) for understanding the Norwegian car market. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the "Electric Vehicle Popularity in Norway" SD model, the citation is:
  > Valentina Orliuk and Daria Yermolova. *Electric vehicles popularity in Norway*. In Proceeding of 2nd Research Conference "Complex socio-economic systems and dynamic modelling", pp. 40â€“43, 2019. URL https://ekmair.ukma.edu.ua/handle/123456789/17929. Model available at https://exchange.iseesystems.com/models/player/mindsproject/electric-vehicles-in-norway.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or verification by others interested in the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the structured output format, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
