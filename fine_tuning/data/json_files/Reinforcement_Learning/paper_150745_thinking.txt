To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaER: An Adaptive Experience Replay Approach for Continual Lifelong Learning" by Xingyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on established supervised continual lifelong learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the benchmarks used for evaluation. In this section, they introduce several datasets:

1. **Split-MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, split into multiple tasks for continual learning scenarios.
2. **Split-FMNIST**: Similar to Split-MNIST, this dataset is a variant of the Fashion-MNIST dataset, also designed for continual learning.
3. **Split-CIFAR10**: This dataset is a split version of the CIFAR-10 dataset, used for evaluating continual learning algorithms.
4. **Split-CIFAR100**: This dataset is a split version of the CIFAR-100 dataset, which is more challenging and used for testing the proposed AdaER algorithm on longer sequences.

In **Table I**, the authors provide numerical details about these benchmarks, including the number of tasks and training data size per task, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the original datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, along with their proper references.
