To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Kalman-based hybrid car following strategy using TD3 and CACC" by Yuqi Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions simulation results with a specific number of timesteps, which suggests that a dataset was used for these simulations.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Simulation)**, where the authors discuss the environment and data used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **NGSIM US101 dataset**, which was collected from a highway in Los Angeles, California. This is a key dataset for the study, and I need to gather details about it.

In this section, the authors describe how they processed the NGSIM dataset, including removing data involving lane changes and selecting specific car-following events. They mention that there are **1520 car following events** in total, divided into a training set and a test set. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **NGSIM US101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexiadis, V., Colyar, J., Halkias, J., Hranac, R., McHale, G. (2004). The Next Generation Simulation Program. ITE. J. 74(8), 22.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **NGSIM US101 Dataset**: This dataset was collected from the southbound highway in Los Angeles, California, and consists of 1520 car following events, which were divided into a training set (1064 events) and a test set (456 events). The dataset was processed to avoid the impact of lane changes and to ensure the quality of the car following data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NGSIM dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.
