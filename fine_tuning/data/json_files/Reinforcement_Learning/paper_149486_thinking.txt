To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptively Calibrated Critic Estimates for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Nicolai Dorka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on the **OpenAI Gym continuous control benchmark** and the **Meta-World robot benchmark**, indicating that these benchmarks may involve datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find specific details about the datasets used. The authors mention evaluating their algorithm on a range of continuous control tasks from **OpenAI Gym** and robotic tasks from the **Meta-World benchmark**. I will need to confirm if these benchmarks are associated with specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their evaluations on various tasks, specifically mentioning the **OpenAI Gym** and **Meta-World** benchmarks. I will check if there are any references or citations provided for these benchmarks in the **References section** of the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Meta-World**: The citation is:
   > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2020). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1094â€“1100). PMLR.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
