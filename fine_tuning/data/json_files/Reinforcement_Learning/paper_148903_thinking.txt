To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFAC Framework: Factorizing the Value Function via Quantile Mixture for Multi-Agent Distributional Q-Learning" by Wei-Fang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their framework on "all Super Hard tasks of StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge," indicating that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and reference the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) as a benchmark for their experiments. This suggests that the SMAC dataset is used.

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors specifically mention that they perform experiments on "all Super Hard maps in SMAC," which confirms the use of the SMAC dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SMAC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, the citation is:
  > Samvelyan, M., Foerster, J., Pettinger, J., et al. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS), pp. 2186â€“2188, May 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted is the SMAC dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
