To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gossip-based Actor-Learner Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Mahmoud Assran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **six Atari games**. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to these games.

I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsection within the experiments that explicitly lists the datasets. In this case, the authors refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment** as the source of their datasets, specifically mentioning the use of Atari-2600 games.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Marlos C. Machado, Marc G. Bellemare, Erik Talvitie, Joel Veness, Matthew J. Hausknecht, and Michael Bowling. *Revisiting the arcade learning environment: Evaluation protocols and open problems for general agents*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 5573â€“5577, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Arcade Learning Environment, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
