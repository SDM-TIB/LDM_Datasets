To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Agent: Explicit Reasoning Agent for Graphs" by Qinyong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the Graph Agent (GA) was evaluated on node classification and link prediction tasks, specifically stating the datasets used: **Cora, PubMed, and PrimeKG**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more details about each dataset. In the **node classification section**, the authors specify that they used the **Cora** and **PubMed** datasets, providing information about their sizes and characteristics. Cora consists of 2,706 nodes, while PubMed has 19,711 nodes. This section confirms their use in the experiments.

In the **link prediction section**, the authors discuss the **PrimeKG** dataset, detailing its complexity and the specific node types and edges considered for their analysis. They mention that PrimeKG includes 2,085 drug nodes, 19,001 gene nodes, and a total of 954,438 edges, which is significant for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 40–48, PMLR, 2016.

2. For the **PubMed dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xiaoyin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 40–48, PMLR, 2016.

3. For the **PrimeKG dataset**, the citation is:
   > Payal Chandak, Kexin Huang, and Marinka Zitnik. *Building a knowledge graph to enable precision medicine*. Scientific Data, 10(1):67, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Cora**: A dataset used for node classification, consisting of 2,706 nodes.
- **PubMed**: Another dataset for node classification, comprising 19,711 nodes.
- **PrimeKG**: A complex biomedical knowledge graph used for link prediction, containing 2,085 drug nodes and 19,001 gene nodes, among others.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
