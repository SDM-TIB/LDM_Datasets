To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning" by Zhipeng Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used. The experiments section typically details the datasets employed for validation and testing.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors reference. If they discuss any specific datasets or environments used for their experiments, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains explicit mentions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that might be titled "Datasets" or similar, as they often summarize the datasets in detail.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the experiments conducted on distributionally robust reinforcement learning. If the authors mention any standard datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to include those.

Once I have gathered the names and descriptions of the datasets, along with their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format. Each dataset entry will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps I will take:
1. Read the **abstract** for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the **introduction** for context and specific dataset references.
3. Examine the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
4. Check the **References section** for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include all necessary details and citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
