To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computationally Efficient Safe Reinforcement Learning for Power Systems" by Daniel Tabas and Baosen Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for frequency regulation in power systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Simulations)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors describe a **9-bus power system model** that they simulate. However, they do not refer to any external datasets but rather describe the model and its parameters.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets or external data sources, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and methodologies related to control systems and reinforcement learning, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments; instead, they created a simulation based on a theoretical model of a power system. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a simulation of a power system, it does not provide any datasets or references to datasets that can be cited. Thus, there are no dataset entries to compile for this research paper.
