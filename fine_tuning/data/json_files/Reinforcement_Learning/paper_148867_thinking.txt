To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ECOL-R: Encouraging Copying in Novel Object Captioning with Reinforcement Learning" by Yufei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **nocaps** and **held-out COCO** benchmarks, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation metrics and datasets in detail. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention the two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **nocaps**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for novel object captioning, which includes new validation and test images from the Open Images Dataset with over 400 novel objects.

2. **held-out COCO**: This dataset is constructed by excluding images containing one of eight selected object classes from the standard COCO 2014 benchmark.

To confirm the details about these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **nocaps** dataset, the citation is:
  > Harsh Agrawal, Karan Desai, Yufei Wang, Xinlei Chen, Rishabh Jain, Mark Johnson, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Stefan Lee, and Peter Anderson. *nocaps: novel object captioning at scale*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For the **held-out COCO** dataset, the citation is:
  > Lisa Anne Hendricks, Subhashini Venugopalan, Marcus Rohrbach, Raymond J. Mooney, Kate Saenko, and Trevor Darrell. *Deep compositional captioning: Describing novel object categories without paired training data*. In 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2016, pages 1â€“10, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
