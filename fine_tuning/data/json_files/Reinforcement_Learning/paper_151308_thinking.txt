To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Feasible and Plausible Counterfactual Explanations for Outcome Prediction of Business Processes" by Alexander Stevens et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various event logs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1**, they mention three specific event logs:

1. **Sepsis Cases**: This dataset records information about patients admitted to a Dutch hospital with symptoms of sepsis. It includes both deviant and regular cases, with labels indicating whether the patient was admitted to the ICU.

2. **BPIC2012**: This dataset contains information about the execution history of a loan application process in a Dutch financial institution. The labeling is based on whether the loan was accepted or not.

3. **BPIC2015**: This dataset consists of event logs from five Dutch municipalities, detailing their building permit application processes. The labeling is based on the satisfaction of a specific LTL rule.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Sepsis Cases**, the citation is:
  > [Author(s)]. *Title of the dataset or study*. [Details about the dataset, if available].

- For **BPIC2012**, the citation is:
  > [Author(s)]. *Title of the dataset or study*. [Details about the dataset, if available].

- For **BPIC2015**, the citation is:
  > [Author(s)]. *Title of the dataset or study*. [Details about the dataset, if available].

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
