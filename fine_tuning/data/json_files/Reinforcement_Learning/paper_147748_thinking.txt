To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deterministic Policy Gradients With General State Transitions" by Qingpeng Cai, Ling Pan, and Pingzhong Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the experiments conducted but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention conducting experiments on several continuous control benchmarks, specifically referencing environments from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that datasets related to these environments are likely used.

I will then look for a **dedicated datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the experiments section. In this paper, the authors refer to various environments, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. Instead, they mention using standard benchmarks, which are typically well-known datasets in the reinforcement learning community.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the environments mentioned. The paper cites OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized platform for reinforcement learning environments. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. 

Additionally, I will note the specific environments mentioned in the experiments:

1. **ComplexPoint-v0**: A toy problem with general state transitions.
2. **Pendulum-v0**: A classic control problem.
3. **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**: A continuous control task.
4. **Swimmer-v2**: A continuous control task.
5. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A continuous control task.
6. **HumanoidStandup-v2**: A continuous control task.
7. **Humanoid-v2**: A continuous control task.

While these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, they are not standalone datasets but rather benchmarks for evaluating algorithms. Therefore, I will document them as part of the OpenAI Gym reference.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for the OpenAI Gym and note the specific environments used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
