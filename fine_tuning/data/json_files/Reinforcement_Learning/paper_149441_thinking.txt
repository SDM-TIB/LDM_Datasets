To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Service Provisioning in NFV-enabled Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ali Nouruzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it may hint at their existence.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their research.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or evaluations. This section is likely to contain explicit references to datasets used for training, testing, or validating their proposed methods. I will take note of any dataset names, sizes, and characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or insights regarding the datasets used, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other methods.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) applications, as these are the main focus of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.
