To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cell-Free Latent Go-Explore" by Quentin Gallouédéc and Emmanuel Dellandréa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the specific datasets employed in the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics that define the datasets.

I will then check the **experiments section** for a dedicated subsection on datasets. This section often contains comprehensive descriptions of the datasets used, including their purpose, size, and any preprocessing steps taken. If the paper includes figures or tables summarizing the datasets, I will carefully analyze these as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari 2600 environments**, I would look for the citation:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. "The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents." Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

If the paper discusses a specific robotic environment, I would find the corresponding citation, such as:
> Gallouédéc, Q., Cazin, N., Dellandréa, E., and Chen, L. "panda-gym: Open-Source Goal-Conditioned Environments for Robotic Learning." 4th Robot Learning Workshop: Self-Supervised and Lifelong Learning at NeurIPS, 2021.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that I provide accurate references for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
