To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Realistic Counterfactuals for Retinal Fundus and OCT Images using Diffusion Models" by Indu Ilanchezian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves generating counterfactual images from retinal fundus and OCT images, which suggests that datasets related to these imaging modalities will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two primary sources of retinal image data:

1. **EyePacs Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 180,000 retinal fundus images collected through a Diabetic Retinopathy screening program. The authors note that they used images with "Good" and "Excellent" quality ratings, resulting in a total of 92,745 images from 27,926 participants.

2. **Kermany Dataset**: This dataset includes a total of 108,309 OCT images categorized into four classes: normal, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), drusen, and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The authors explain how they created training, validation, and test splits from this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **EyePacs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Veronica Elisa Castillo Benítez, Ingrid Castro Matto, Julio César Mello Román, José Luis Vázquez Noguera, Miguel García-Torres, Jordan Ayala, Diego P. Pinto-Roa, Pedro E. Gardel-Sotomayor, Jacques Facon, and Sebastian Alberto Grillo. *Dataset from fundus images for the study of diabetic retinopathy*. Data in Brief, 36:107068, 2021.

- For the **Kermany Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Kermany, Kang Zhang, Michael Goldbaum, et al. *Labeled optical coherence tomography (OCT) and chest X-ray images for classification*. Mendeley Data, 2(2):651, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
