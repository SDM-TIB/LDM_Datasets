To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A study of first-passage time minimization via Q-learning in heated gridworlds" by M. A. Larchenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the optimization of first-passage times in heated gridworlds, which may imply the use of simulated environments or datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of specific datasets or environments. The introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference existing datasets or describe the experimental setup.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or methodology**. This section typically outlines the specific datasets used in the experiments. If the paper includes a section titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup," I will focus on that to find detailed descriptions of the datasets.

In this paper, I will look for any references to specific gridworld configurations or simulation parameters that could be considered datasets. For example, the authors may describe the parameters of the heated gridworlds, such as temperature distributions or grid sizes, which could be treated as datasets for the purposes of this research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper refers to any established datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to include their full citations as well. For example, if the authors reference a specific gridworld configuration or a simulation framework, I will look for the original source or publication that describes that dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include details such as the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper, complete with proper citations for each dataset identified.
