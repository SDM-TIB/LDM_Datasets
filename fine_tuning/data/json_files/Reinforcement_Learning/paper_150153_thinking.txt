To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Demonstrations with Latent Space Priors" by Jonas Gehring et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their approach on a set of challenging sparse-reward environments and that they utilize publicly available motion capture sequences. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.3**, they explicitly mention that they evaluate their approach on two offline RL datasets: **AntMaze** and **Kitchen**. I will note these datasets and look for more details about them.

In **Appendix C.6**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that for the AntMaze experiments, they use the dataset from "antmaze-medium-diverse-v1" for pre-training and "antmaze-medium-diverse-v0" and "antmaze-large-diverse-v0" for learning high-level policies. For the kitchen experiments, they use the "kitchen-mixed-v0" dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. For the **AntMaze datasets**:
   - Ajay, A., Kumar, A., Agrawal, P., Levine, S., & Nachum, O. (2021). OPAL: Offline Primitive Discovery for Accelerating Offline Reinforcement Learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

2. For the **Kitchen dataset**:
   - Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2021). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:2004.07219.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
