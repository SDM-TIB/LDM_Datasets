To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" by John Schulman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments on benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using **7 simulated robotics tasks implemented in OpenAI Gym** and refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment** for Atari games. This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these environments.

I will then look for any explicit names of datasets in the text. The paper mentions the following environments:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which includes various environments for testing. The specific datasets are not named, but the environments themselves serve as datasets for the experiments.

2. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This is another benchmark mentioned in the context of Atari games. Again, while the specific datasets are not named, the environments themselves are used as datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the mentioned environments:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2015). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. In Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets beyond these environments, I will summarize the findings accordingly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each environment as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for the datasets referenced in the paper.
