To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of Financial Literacy on Investment Decisions and Stock Market Participation" by Gunbir Singh Baveja and Aaryavir Verma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the qualitative nature of the research and the use of data collected from social media platforms, which suggests that the dataset may consist of social media content rather than traditional datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4 (Method)**, where the authors describe their data collection methods. In **section 4.2 (Sources of Data)**, they list various social media platforms and financial blogs from which data was collected, including YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, Forbes, 5Paisa, World Economic Forum, and Financial Times. This indicates that the dataset is derived from user-generated content on these platforms.

In **section 4.3 (Data Collection)**, the authors detail their systematic approach to gathering data, including identifying keywords and conducting platform-specific searches. They mention extracting relevant posts, comments, and discussions, which further clarifies the nature of the dataset as qualitative data from social media interactions.

Since the paper does not reference any traditional datasets or provide specific dataset names, I will focus on documenting the sources of data as the dataset itself. The authors do not provide formal citations for these sources, but I can summarize them as follows:

1. **Social Media Platforms**: The dataset includes content from various social media platforms, specifically:
   - YouTube
   - Reddit
   - LinkedIn
   - Quora

2. **Financial Blogs**: The dataset also includes content from financial blogs and news sources, specifically:
   - Forbes
   - 5Paisa
   - World Economic Forum
   - Financial Times

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset sources into a structured format, ensuring to note that these are not traditional datasets with formal citations but rather qualitative data sources utilized in the research.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the social media platforms or blogs, I will acknowledge that these platforms are widely recognized sources of information and user-generated content in the financial domain.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset, emphasizing the qualitative nature of the data collected from social media and financial blogs, and note that the authors did not provide formal citations for these sources.
