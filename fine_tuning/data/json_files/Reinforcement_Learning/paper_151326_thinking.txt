To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JaxUED: A simple and useable UED library in Jax" by Samuel Coward et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for benchmarking their methods. I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several environments used for their experiments, specifically in the context of maze environments. They refer to various maze configurations as benchmarks for their UED methods. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in the text.

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to the maze environments or other datasets used in their experiments. The authors reference several works related to UED and maze environments, which may provide insights into the datasets they are utilizing.

After reviewing the references, I identify the following relevant citations:

1. **MiniGrid Environment**: The authors mention that their maze environment is compliant with the original MiniGrid implementation. The citation for this is:
   > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Dai, B., Towers, M., de Lazcano, R., Willems, L., Lahlou, S., Pal, S. C., & Terry, J. (2023). *Minigrid & miniworld: Modular & customizable reinforcement learning environments for goal-oriented tasks*. CoRR, abs/2306.13831.

2. **UED Literature**: The authors reference several papers that discuss UED methods and benchmarks, which may imply the use of datasets from those works. Notably:
   > Dennis, M., Jaques, N., Vinitsky, E., Bayen, A. M., Russell, S., Critch, A., & Levine, S. (2020). *Emergent complexity and zero-shot transfer via unsupervised environment design*. In H. Larochelle, M. Ranzato, R. Hadsell, M. Balcan, & H. Lin (Eds.), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

3. **Prior Implementations**: The authors compare their results against prior implementations, which may also reference datasets used in those studies:
   > Jiang, M., Dennis, M., Parker-Holder, J., Grefenstette, E., & Rockt√§schel, T. (2021a). *Replay-guided adversarial environment design*. In M. Ranzato, A. Beygelzimer, Y. N. Dauphin, P. Liang, & J. W. Vaughan (Eds.), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have identified the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be documented with its full citation to ensure proper attribution and reference.
