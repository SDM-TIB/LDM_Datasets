To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal models in string diagrams" by Robin Lorenz and Sean Tull, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading the entire paper, paying close attention to sections that typically mention datasets, such as the **Introduction**, **Methodology**, **Experiments**, and **Results** sections. These sections often contain explicit references to datasets used in the research.

2. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Datasets**: As I read, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

3. **Look for References to Previous Works**: If the authors mention datasets that are derived from or based on previous works, I will note these references as they often provide the necessary citations for the datasets.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying datasets in the main text, I will consult the **References** section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete references.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will create a detailed entry that includes:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Cross-Verify Information**: If there are any ambiguities or uncertainties regarding the datasets, I will cross-reference with other sections of the paper or external sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.

7. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
