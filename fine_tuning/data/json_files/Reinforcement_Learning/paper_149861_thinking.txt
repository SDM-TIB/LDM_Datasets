To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mildly Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Jiafei Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **D4RL benchmarks**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved. The introduction will likely provide more context about these datasets and their significance in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this case, the paper does not have a clearly labeled section, so I will need to search through the **experiments** section for any mentions of datasets used in the evaluations. The authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and testing their models in this section.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I will note any specific datasets mentioned, such as the **D4RL MuJoCo locomotion tasks**. The paper discusses various datasets like **random, medium, medium-replay, medium-expert, and expert** datasets, which are part of the D4RL benchmark suite.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets. The D4RL benchmark is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to include its citation.

The citation for the D4RL benchmark is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. ArXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets used in the research. This will ensure that the extraction is comprehensive and adheres to academic standards for citation.
