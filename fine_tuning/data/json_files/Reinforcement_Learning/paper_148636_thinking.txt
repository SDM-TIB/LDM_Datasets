To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConfuciuX: Autonomous Hardware Resource Assignment for DNN Accelerators using Reinforcement Learning" by Sheng-Chun Kao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Evaluation," or "Datasets."** These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for training, validation, or testing the models discussed in the paper.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on popular DNN models, including **MobileNet-V2, ResNet-50, MnasNet, GNMT, Transformer, and NCF.** However, I need to confirm if any specific datasets are associated with these models.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are not explicitly named in the text, I will look for any references that might indicate the datasets used in the experiments.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
