To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Deep Learning Model Calibration for Classification Problems in Mechanics" by Saeed Mohammadzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on "7 open access engineering mechanics datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Benchmark Datasets Used in this Study)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section is likely to contain the names and characteristics of the datasets used in their investigation.

In subsection 2.1, the authors describe three main datasets:

1. **Buckling Instability Classification (BIC)**: This dataset includes three sub-datasets (BIC 1, BIC 2, BIC 3) that classify columns as stable or unstable based on material property distributions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Emma Lejeune. *Buckling instability classification (BIC)*. https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/40085, 2020.

2. **Asymmetric Buckling Columns (ABC)**: This dataset also consists of three sub-datasets (ABC 1, ABC 2, ABC 3) that classify columns based on their buckling behavior. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Peerasait Prachaseree and Emma Lejeune. *Asymmetric buckling columns (ABC)*. https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/43730, 2022.

3. **Mechanical MNIST – Crack Path**: This dataset is a collection of images used for predicting crack paths in materials. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Saeed Mohammadzadeh and Emma Lejeune. *Mechanical MNIST – Crack Path*. https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/42757, 2021.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their descriptions and ensure that I have captured all necessary details, such as the number of samples and the specific characteristics of each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as outlined above. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
