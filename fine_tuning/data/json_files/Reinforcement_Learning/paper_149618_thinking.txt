To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Convergence of SARSA with Linear Function Approximation" by Shangtong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used in the study. In the abstract, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For this specific paper, I will look for any datasets mentioned throughout the text, particularly in sections that discuss experiments or results. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information systematically for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
