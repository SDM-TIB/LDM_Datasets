To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PcLast: Discovering Plannable Continuous Latent States" by Anurag Koul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several environments and datasets in section 4.1 (Environments). The key datasets identified are:

1. **Maze2D Point Mass Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500,000 samples collected from various maze configurations. Each sample includes observations, states, actions, and next states. The dataset is used to train the latent dynamics model.

2. **Sawyer-Reach Dataset**: This dataset contains 20,000 transitions generated from a random policy in the Sawyer-Reach environment, where a robotic arm is tasked with reaching various goal positions.

3. **Exogenous Noise Mujoco Datasets**: The authors mention using control tasks from the visual-d4rl benchmark, specifically the "Cheetah-Run" and "Walker-Walk" tasks, which include datasets with varying qualities (medium, medium-expert, and expert) that incorporate exogenous noise.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Maze2D Point Mass Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is based on the authors' own experimental setup.
  
- For the **Sawyer-Reach Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nair, A. V., Pong, V., Dalal, M., Bahl, S., Lin, S., and Levine, S. *Visual reinforcement learning with imagined goals*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 31, 2018.

- For the **Exogenous Noise Mujoco Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Lu, C., Ball, P. J., Rudner, T. G. J., Parker-Holder, J., Osborne, M. A., and Teh, Y. W. *Challenges and opportunities in offline reinforcement learning from visual observations*. CoRR, abs/2206.04779, 2022.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
