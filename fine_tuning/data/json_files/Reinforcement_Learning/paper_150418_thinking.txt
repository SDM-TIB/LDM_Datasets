To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using a Variational Autoencoder to Learn Valid Search Spaces of Safely Monitored Autonomous Robots for Last-Mile Delivery" by Peter J. Bentley et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments or methodologies.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. Here, they mention the use of a genetic algorithm for dataset generation and the application of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a latent representation. I will look for any specific datasets that were generated or used in their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors outline their experimental setup and the parameters they varied. They discuss the dataset size and the generation process, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their research. I will note any specific datasets mentioned, including their sizes and characteristics.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is important for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the study.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Dataset for COIL**: The authors mention generating a dataset using a genetic algorithm with a population size of 200 for 200 generations. This dataset is crucial for training the VAE and is described as containing valid sets of robot start times and durations that satisfy the constraints.

2. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Dataset**: The dataset used for training the VAE is derived from the outputs of the genetic algorithm. The authors specify that they generated datasets of varying sizes (e.g., 2500, 5000, 7500, and 10000 data points) to evaluate the performance of COIL.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

- For the dataset generation method, the citation is:
  > Bentley, P. J., Lim, S. L., Gaier, A., & Tran, L. (2022). COIL: Constrained optimization in learned latent space—learning representations for valid solutions. In Proceedings of the ACM Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) Companion, 2022, pp. 1870–1877.

- For the VAE method, the citation is:
  > Kingma, D. P., & Welling, M. (2014). Auto-encoding variational bayes. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution.
