To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Twin-Assisted Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Edge Task Scheduling" by Xiucheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Digital Twin (DT) to enhance reinforcement learning for task scheduling, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation setup, including the parameters for task size, complexity, and deadlines, but they do not reference any specific datasets or publicly available data sources.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers related to task scheduling and reinforcement learning, but they do not appear to provide specific datasets that were used in the experiments.

Since the paper primarily discusses simulation results rather than empirical results based on real-world datasets, it seems that no external datasets were utilized. Instead, the authors generated synthetic data for their experiments, as indicated by the description of task parameters being uniformly distributed.

Given this analysis, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper, as it relies on simulated data rather than established datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets, as none were used in the research.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not reference any external datasets, and the experiments were conducted using synthetic data generated based on specified parameters.
