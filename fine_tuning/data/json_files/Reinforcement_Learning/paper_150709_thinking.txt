To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Disentanglement-based Reachability Planning" by Zhifeng Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method in "three vision-based simulation tasks and one real-world task," which indicates that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section IV)**, where the authors describe the tasks used for evaluation. They specifically mention three simulation tasks: **UR-Pusher-1, UR-Pusher-2, and UR-Pick-Place**, as well as a real-world task called **Real-Pusher**. I will note these tasks as they likely correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experiment setup (Section IV-A)**, the authors state that the tasks are based on **Robosuite**, which is a modular simulation framework. This suggests that the datasets for the simulation tasks are derived from the Robosuite environment. I will need to confirm this by checking the references to Robosuite in the paper.

I will also look for any specific dataset citations in the **References section**. The authors reference Robosuite as follows:
> Y. Zhu, J. Wong, A. Mandlekar, and R. Martín-Martín, “robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12293, 2020.

This citation provides the necessary details for the Robosuite framework, which is essential for understanding the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations:

1. **UR-Pusher-1**: A vision-based robotic manipulation task based on the Robosuite framework.
2. **UR-Pusher-2**: Another vision-based robotic manipulation task based on the Robosuite framework.
3. **UR-Pick-Place**: A vision-based robotic manipulation task based on the Robosuite framework.
4. **Real-Pusher**: A real-world task that mirrors the UR-Pusher-1 task.

The full citation for the Robosuite framework, which encompasses the datasets for the simulation tasks, is:
> Y. Zhu, J. Wong, A. Mandlekar, and R. Martín-Martín, “robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12293, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
