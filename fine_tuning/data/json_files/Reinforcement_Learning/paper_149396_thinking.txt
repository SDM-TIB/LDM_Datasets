To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving on Urban Environments" by Gustavo Claudio Karl Couto and Eric Aislan Antonelo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may mention the context of the datasets used, particularly in relation to the CARLA simulation environment.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe the expert dataset built using a deterministic agent navigating through a dense point trajectory and a classic PID controller. They mention that the dataset consists of two setups: a short route and a long route, with specific details about the number of trajectories and samples collected.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Short Route Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 complete trajectories recorded at 10 Hz, totaling 3,000 training samples (4GB of uncompressed data). It is used for the short route of 100 meters with one turn.

2. **Long Route Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 complete trajectories recorded at 10 Hz, totaling 18,000 training samples (30GB of uncompressed data). It is used for the long route of 2,500 meters with four turns.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets:

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. 2017.

Additionally, I will note that the expert dataset is generated from a deterministic agent, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is likely a product of the authors' own experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the CARLA simulator and any other relevant references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
