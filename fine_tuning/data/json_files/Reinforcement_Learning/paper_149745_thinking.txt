To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Reports for Reinforcement Learning" by Thomas Krendl Gilbert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Examples)**, where the authors provide specific examples of Reward Reports for various systems, including **BlenderBot 3**, **Project Flow**, and **MovieLens**. Each of these examples is likely to reference datasets used in their respective systems.

For **BlenderBot 3**, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of its training or evaluation. The paper states that it uses a large language model and mentions the datasets used for training and evaluation, such as the **PushShift.io dataset** for Reddit comments.

For **Project Flow**, I will check for datasets related to traffic management and reinforcement learning, as the paper discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning in traffic control.

For **MovieLens**, I will identify the datasets associated with the recommendation system, which are likely to include historical user ratings and movie metadata.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **PushShift.io Dataset**: This dataset is used for training BlenderBot 3 and consists of Reddit comments. The citation is:
   > Baumgartner, J., Zannettou, S., Keegan, B., Squire, M., & Blackburn, J. (2020). The Pushshift Reddit Dataset. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 14, 830-839.

2. **Project Flow Dataset**: This dataset is likely related to traffic data and may not have a specific citation in the paper, but I will look for any references to datasets used in the context of traffic management.

3. **MovieLens Dataset**: The MovieLens dataset is a well-known dataset for movie recommendations. The citation is:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 1-19.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in accordance with academic standards.
