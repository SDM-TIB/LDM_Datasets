To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Refined Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation" by Yukun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Materials and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: **DRIVE**, **STARE**, **CHASEDB1**, and **HRF**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of images, resolution, and any specific training/testing splits mentioned.

1. **DRIVE Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 40 color retinal fundus images with a resolution of (565, 584). They mention a training set of 20 images and a test set of 20 images, with annotations provided.

2. **STARE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 retinal fundus images with a resolution of 700×605. The authors note that they use a "leave one out" strategy for training and testing.

3. **CHASEDB1 Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset includes 28 retinal fundus images with a resolution of 999×960 pixels, divided into a training set of 20 images and a test set of 8 images.

4. **HRF Dataset**: This dataset has a resolution of 3504×2336 and includes three subsets: healthy, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucomatous, each containing 15 images. The authors specify their training/testing split for this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **DRIVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Hoover, V. Kouznetsova, M. Goldbaum. "Locating blood vessels in retinal images by piecewise threshold probing of a matched filter response." *IEEE Trans. Med. Imag.*, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 203-210, 2000.

- For the **STARE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. G. Owen, A. Rudnicka, R. Mullen, S. Barman, D. Monekosso, P. Whincup. "Measuring retinal vessel tortuosity in 10-year-old children: Validation of the computer-assisted image analysis of the retina (CAIAR) program." *Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.*, vol. 50, no. 5, pp. 2004–2010, 2009.

- For the **CHASEDB1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Attila, B. Rüdiger, M. Andreas, H. Joachim, M. Georg. "Robust Vessel Segmentation in Fundus Images." *International Journal of Biomedical Imaging*, vol. 2013, 2013.

- For the **HRF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Marin, A. Aquino, M. Gegundez-Arias, J. M. Bravo. "A new supervised method for blood vessel segmentation in retinal images by using gray-level and moment invariants-based features." *IEEE Trans. Med. Imag.*, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 146–158, Jan. 2011.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
