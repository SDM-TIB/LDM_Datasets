To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameterized Reinforcement Learning for Optical System Optimization" by Heribert Wankerl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and the tasks they performed, which may include references to datasets used for training or testing their models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss three different optimization tasks and provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes details about the tasks, such as target curves, wavelengths, incident angles, and the number of layers. While this table does not explicitly mention datasets, it may imply the use of datasets for the simulations conducted.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation information for each dataset.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the datasets I will extract:

1. **Task 1 Dataset**: This dataset is implied through the optimization task described in Table 1, but no specific dataset is mentioned. I will note that the authors did not provide a dataset citation for this task.

2. **Task 2 Dataset**: Similar to Task 1, this task is described in the context of a high-pass filter design, but again, no specific dataset is cited.

3. **Task 3 Dataset**: This task involves a reference design developed by human experts, but no dataset is explicitly mentioned.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for any referenced works that may relate to datasets, even if they are not explicitly labeled as datasets in the paper. 

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, ensuring that I provide full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper, while also noting any tasks that do not have explicit dataset references.
