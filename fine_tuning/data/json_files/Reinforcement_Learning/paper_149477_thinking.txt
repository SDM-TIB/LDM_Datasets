To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond NDCG: behavioral testing of recommender systems with RecList" by Patrick John Chia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors released an open-source package with connectors for important public datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed included in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors are likely to provide specific details about the datasets used in their methodology. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Coveo Data Challenge**: This dataset is referenced as a public dataset used for testing recommender systems.
2. **MovieLens**: A well-known dataset in the recommender systems community, often used for evaluating recommendation algorithms.
3. **Spotify**: Another popular dataset that is likely used for testing music recommendation systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Coveo Data Challenge**, the citation is:
  > Tagliabue, J., Greco, C., Roy, J.-F., Bianchi, F., Cassani, G., Yu, B., & Chia, P. J. (2021). SIGIR 2021 E-Commerce Workshop Data Challenge. In SIGIR eCom 2021.

- For **MovieLens**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst., 5(4), Article 19. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872

- For **Spotify**, the citation is:
  > Zamani, H., Schedl, M., Lamere, P., & Chen, C.-W. (2019). An Analysis of Approaches Taken in the ACM RecSys Challenge 2018 for Automatic Music Playlist Continuation. ACM Trans. Intell. Syst. Technol., 10(5), Article 57. https://doi.org/10.1145/3344257

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided the necessary citations for each.
