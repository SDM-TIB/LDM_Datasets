To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selective Replay Enhances Learning in Online Continual Analogical Reasoning" by Tyler L. Hayes and Christopher Kanan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on continual learning of analogical reasoning using Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPMs), which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **RAVEN dataset**, which contains 1,120,000 images and 70,000 associated questions, distributed among seven unique figure configurations. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RAVEN dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Chi Zhang, Feng Gao, Baoxiong Jia, Yixin Zhu, and Song-Chun Zhu. *Raven: A dataset for relational and analogical visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5317–5327, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the RAVEN dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on this dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will allow for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
