To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-based Reasoning and Learning under Partial Observability in Ad Hoc Teamwork" by Hasra Dodampegama and Mohan Sridharan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed architecture in two simulated multiagent benchmark domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention two specific domains: **Fort Attack (FA)** and **Half Field Offense (HFO)**. This indicates that these domains may serve as datasets or benchmarks for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors describe the use of these two domains in detail. They mention that the FA domain involves a team of guards protecting a fort from attackers, while the HFO domain is a simulated soccer environment. This confirms that both domains are indeed datasets used for evaluation.

I will then look for any specific references or citations related to these datasets in the **References section**. The authors do not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, but they do reference other works that describe the environments:

1. **Fort Attack (FA)**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is based on the work by Deka and Sycara (2021), which I will note.

2. **Half Field Offense (HFO)**: This dataset is based on the work by Hausknecht et al. (2016), which I will also note.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for the referenced works:

- For **Fort Attack (FA)**, I will note:
  > Deka, A., & Sycara, K. (2021). Natural emergence of heterogeneous strategies in artificially intelligent competitive teams. In Advances in Swarm Intelligence (pp. 13-25). Springer International Publishing.

- For **Half Field Offense (HFO)**, I will note:
  > Hausknecht, M., Muapparaju, P., Subramanian, S., Kalyanakrishnan, S., & Stone, P. (2016). Half field offense: An environment for multiagent learning and ad hoc teamwork. In AAMAS Adaptive Learning Agents Workshop.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing.
