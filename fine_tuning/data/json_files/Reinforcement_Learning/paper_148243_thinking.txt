To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning by Cheating" by Dian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on the **CARLA benchmark** and the **NoCrash benchmark**, which suggests that these may be datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **method** section, the authors describe the training of a privileged agent and a sensorimotor agent, but I need to confirm the specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I find that the authors mention collecting **157K training frames** from a hand-crafted expert autopilot in the CARLA simulator. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the CARLA simulator, which is a significant source of data for their experiments.

I will also check the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following benchmarks:

1. **CARLA Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In CoRL.

2. **NoCrash Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Codevilla, F., Santana, E., López, A., & Gaidon, A. (2019). Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving. In ICCV.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CARLA Benchmark**: A dataset used for training and evaluating the autonomous driving system.
- **NoCrash Benchmark**: Another dataset used for evaluation purposes.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
