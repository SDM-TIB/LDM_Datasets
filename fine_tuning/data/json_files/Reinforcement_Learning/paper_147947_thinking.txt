To extract datasets from the research paper titled "META-Learning State-based Eligibility Traces for More Sample-Efficient Policy Evaluation" by Mingde Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets used in the experiments, such as environments or benchmarks that the authors evaluated their method on. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of instances, features, or any unique characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "RingWorld" or "FrozenLake," I will look for the original sources or papers that introduced these datasets and extract their citations. If the datasets are publicly available, I will also note any URLs or repositories mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
