To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Batch Selection Policy for Active Metric Learning" by Priyadarshini K et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with several real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **Yummly Food Dataset**: This dataset contains 72,148 triplets based on taste similarity among 73 food items, with each item represented by a 6D feature vector. The authors used 20,000 training and 20,000 test triplets.

2. **TUM Haptic Texture Dataset**: This dataset includes signals from 108 types of surface materials, with each material represented by a 32-D spectral feature vector. Similar to the Yummly dataset, it also has 20,000 training and 20,000 test triplets.

3. **Abstract500 Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 images with pairwise perceptual similarities. Each image is represented by a 512-D GIST feature vector, and the authors generated 20,000 training and 20,000 test triplets.

4. **CUB-200 Image Dataset**: This dataset contains images of 200 bird species, with roughly 30 images per class. The authors generated 10,000 training and 10,000 test triplets from a total of 93,530 triplets.

5. **Scoot Facial Sketch Dataset**: This smaller dataset consists of 1,282 triplets representing similarity orderings between facial sketches. The training and test sets contain 800 and 200 triplets, respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Yummly Food Dataset**:
  > Wilber, M.J., Kwak, I.S., Belongie, S.J. "Cost-effective hits for relative similarity comparisons." In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2014.

- For the **TUM Haptic Texture Dataset**:
  > Strese, M., Boeck, Y., Steinbach, E. "Content-based surface material retrieval." In Proceedings of the WHC, 2017.

- For the **Abstract500 Image Dataset**:
  > Robb, D.A., Padilla, S., Kalkreuter, B., Chantler, J. "Crowdsourced feedback with imagery rather than text: Would designers use it?" In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference, 2015.

- For the **CUB-200 Image Dataset**:
  > Wah, C., Maji, S., Belongie, S. "Learning localized perceptual similarity metrics for interactive categorization." In Proceedings of the WACV, 2015.

- For the **Scoot Facial Sketch Dataset**:
  > Fan, D.P., Zhang, S., Wu, Y.H., Liu, Y., Cheng, M.M., Ren, B., Rosin, P.L., Ji, R. "Scoot: A perceptual metric for facial sketches." In Proceedings of the ICCV, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
