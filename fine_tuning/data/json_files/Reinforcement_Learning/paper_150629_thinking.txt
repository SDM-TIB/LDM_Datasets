To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary Strategy Guided Reinforcement Learning via MultiBuffer Communication" by Karl Mason et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental study sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on **MuJoCo control tasks**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental study section** (section 4), where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They specifically mention using the **OpenAI gym package**, which provides various continuous state and action space environments through the **MuJoCo physics simulator**. The environments listed include:

1. **HalfCheetah**: A common benchmark environment for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **Swimmer**: Another standard environment used in reinforcement learning research.
3. **Ant**: A multi-jointed robot environment that is frequently analyzed in this domain.
4. **Walker2d**: A control task involving a bipedal robot.

These environments are not traditional datasets in the sense of static data collections, but they are widely recognized benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the environments mentioned. However, since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo, I will provide a citation for the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo documentation instead:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the names of the environments and their respective citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
