To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Epidemic Decision-making System Based on Federated Reinforcement Learning" by Yangxi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of epidemic data for decision-making, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the parameters used for training their models. They mention using the **SIDARTHE model** for simulating the epidemic environment, which indicates that the model relies on specific datasets for its parameters.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This could provide insights into the datasets that are commonly used in epidemic modeling and decision-making.

After reviewing these sections, I will look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context about the data used in the experiments. For instance, if there are tables listing parameters or results, they may also reference the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper references the SIDARTHE model, I will look for the original paper that introduced this model to provide a complete citation. If the authors mention using real-world epidemic data, I will identify the source of that data and include its citation as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
