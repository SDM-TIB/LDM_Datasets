To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Old TREC Collections Reliably Evaluate Modern Neural Retrieval Models?" by Ellen M. Voorhees et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the TREC-8 ad hoc collection, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the TREC collections and their reusability for evaluating modern retrieval systems. This section may provide insights into the specific datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 3 (Methods)**, the authors describe the TREC-8 ad hoc collection in detail, noting that it contains approximately 525,000 full-text documents and 50 topics. They also mention that the collection was constructed using deep pools over a diverse set of runs, which is crucial for understanding its context as a dataset.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of the new runs evaluated in the paper. The authors refer to several retrieval models and their training data, specifically mentioning that the models were trained on the **MS MARCO (V1) passage data**. This indicates that MS MARCO is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **TREC-8 Ad Hoc Collection**: The citation for the TREC-8 collection is:
   > Ellen M. Voorhees and Donna K. Harman. *Overview of the Eighth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-8)*. In Proceedings of the Eighth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-8), E.M. Voorhees and D.K. Harman (Eds.), 1â€“24, NIST Special Publication 500-246, 2000.

2. **MS MARCO (V1) Passage Data**: The citation for the MS MARCO dataset is:
   > Peilin Yang, Hui Fang, and Jimmy Lin. *Anserini: Reproducible Ranking Baselines Using Lucene*. Journal of Data and Information Quality, 10(4): Article 16, 2018. (Note: The specific citation for MS MARCO may vary; it is often referenced in related works, so I will ensure to check the relevant literature for the most accurate citation.)

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the study.
