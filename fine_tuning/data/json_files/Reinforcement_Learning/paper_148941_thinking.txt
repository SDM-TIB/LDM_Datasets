To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven control of room temperature and bidirectional EV charging using deep reinforcement learning: simulations and experiments" by Svetozarevic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe the **DFAB HOUSE** as the primary case study for their experiments. I will look for specific details about the data collected from this building, such as the types of measurements taken (e.g., room temperature, energy consumption, etc.) and the time resolution of the data.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their models based on the datasets used. This section can provide additional context about the datasets and their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. For example, if the authors refer to existing datasets or methodologies from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations.

For the **DFAB HOUSE**, I will note the following details:
- **Dataset Name**: DFAB HOUSE Data
- **Description**: Data collected from the DFAB HOUSE at Empa Duebendorf, Switzerland, including room temperature, energy consumption, and weather data.
- **Citation**: 
  > DFAB HOUSE â€“ Digital Fabrication and Living, Empa, Duebendorf, Switzerland, 2021. https://www.empa.ch/web/nest/digital-fabrication (Accessed: 20.05.2021).

I will also check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those related to the EV battery model or any external datasets used for validation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
