To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Learning for Same-Day Delivery with Vehicles and Drones" by Xinwei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on data drawn from varied spatial/temporal distributions, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of same-day delivery and the need for effective routing strategies, but I need to find explicit dataset names or descriptions.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the data used for experiments. If there is a section specifically titled **"Datasets"** or similar, I will examine it closely. If not, I will look for any references to datasets within the text that describe the experiments or computational studies.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were collected or structured.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the **"Same-Day Delivery Dataset"**, I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will cite the original source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and well-organized, ready for any further processing or review.
