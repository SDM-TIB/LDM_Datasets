To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning based on Scenario-tree MPC for ASVs" by Arash Bahari Kordabad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of simulations on a nonlinear 3-DOF model of the Cybership II, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this model or the simulations.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for their simulations. In this case, the paper mentions that the method is illustrated in simulation, but it does not specify any external datasets. Instead, it focuses on the model dynamics and the simulation parameters.

I will also look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various papers that may have datasets related to the control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) or similar studies. However, I need to ensure that these references are indeed datasets and not just related works.

After reviewing the paper, I find that there are no specific datasets mentioned that can be extracted directly. The authors primarily focus on the simulation of their proposed method rather than utilizing publicly available datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets. However, I will note that the authors reference several works that may contain relevant datasets for further exploration.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments.
- The focus is on simulations of the Cybership II model.
- Relevant references may contain datasets, but they are not directly cited as datasets in this paper.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable.
