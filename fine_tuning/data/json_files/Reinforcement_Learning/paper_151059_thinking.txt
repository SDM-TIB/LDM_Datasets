To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effective Horizon Explains Deep RL Performance in Stochastic Environments" by Cassidy Laidlaw et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).

In this paper, the authors mention using the **BRIDGE environments** for their experiments. I will note that the BRIDGE dataset is a collection of environments designed for reinforcement learning tasks, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets that have been used in similar studies. This could provide additional context or alternative datasets that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For the BRIDGE environments, I will note that the citation is:
> Laidlaw, C., Russell, S., & Dragan, A. (2023). *Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09853.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will ensure to find their respective citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references.
