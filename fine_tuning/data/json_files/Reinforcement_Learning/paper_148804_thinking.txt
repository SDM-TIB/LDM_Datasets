To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaZero Based Post-Storm Repair Crew Dispatch for Distribution Grid Restoration" by Hang Shuai and Fangxing Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including the challenges posed by natural disasters on distribution grids. They reference previous works and methodologies but do not explicitly mention datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach to the utility vehicle routing problem. They mention using simulation results on two distribution systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved in these simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors present simulation results on two distribution systems: an **8-node test system** and a **modified IEEE 123-node distribution system**. They provide details about the parameters and configurations of these systems, which implies that these systems serve as datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **references section**. The paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, but I can infer the following:

1. **8-node test system**: This is a custom dataset created for the purpose of the study. Since it is not published elsewhere, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

2. **Modified IEEE 123-node distribution system**: The authors reference the IEEE 123-node test feeder, which is a well-known dataset in power systems research. The citation for this dataset is:
   > "IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder." (Date last accessed 5-February-2021). Available: https://site.ieee.org/pes-testfeeders/resources/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- For the **8-node test system**, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.
- For the **modified IEEE 123-node distribution system**, I will use the citation provided above.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
