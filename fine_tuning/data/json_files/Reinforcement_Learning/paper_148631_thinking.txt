To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the single track train scheduling problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Valerio Agasucci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of machine learning methods to the train dispatching problem, but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on a rail network composed of 140 linear blocks with 42 parallel resources. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets used for training or testing.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **methodology** sections (Sections 2 and 3), where the authors describe their approaches to train dispatching and reinforcement learning. They mention generating instances of the train dispatching problem based on certain parameters, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not provide any external datasets or references to publicly available datasets, I will note that the authors generated their own instances for the experiments. The parameters for these instances include the number of trains, their positions, directions, priorities, and lengths, but these are not linked to any established datasets.

Finally, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. However, the references primarily consist of literature on reinforcement learning and train scheduling, rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not provide any named datasets or external references to datasets. Instead, it relies on generated instances for its experiments. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly, noting that no formal datasets were extracted from the paper.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets in the paper.
