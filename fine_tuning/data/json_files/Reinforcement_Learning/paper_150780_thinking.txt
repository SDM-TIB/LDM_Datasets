To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sim-to-Real Transfer for Traffic Signal Control with Prompt Learning" by Longchao Da et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning methods and mentions experiments conducted to mitigate performance gaps in traffic signal control, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they describe the simulation environment (LibSignal) and the real-world environment (SUMO) used for their experiments, which indicates that these environments may contain datasets relevant to their study.

In the **experiment settings section**, the authors provide configurations for the real-world scenarios, which include specific parameters for different weather conditions (rainy and snowy) and vehicle types. However, they do not explicitly name datasets but rather describe the settings used for simulations and real-world evaluations.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that describe datasets used in their experiments. The references may provide additional context or citations for datasets that are indirectly mentioned in the paper.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If the datasets are not explicitly named, I will note the environments and configurations used in the experiments as they may serve as datasets for the study.

Finally, I will ensure that I document the full citations for any datasets or relevant papers that describe the datasets used in the research. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets for their own research.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section for specific details about datasets or environments used.
3. Checking the references section for citations related to datasets.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or relevant paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
