To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Gradients for Discrete Random Variables by Sampling Without Replacement" by Wouter Kool et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments with a toy problem, a categorical Variational Auto-Encoder, and a structured prediction problem, but does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention using a **Bernoulli Toy Experiment** and a **Categorical Variational Auto-Encoder**. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here. 

In **Section 4.2**, they mention using the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for training image processing systems. The authors state that they used a binarized version of MNIST, which is relevant for their experiments.

In **Section 4.3**, they refer to the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, but this is more of a problem setup rather than a dataset. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MNIST dataset is commonly cited, and I can provide its standard citation:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Used in the experiments, specifically a binarized version for training the Categorical Variational Auto-Encoder.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The full citation for the MNIST dataset will be included to ensure proper attribution.
