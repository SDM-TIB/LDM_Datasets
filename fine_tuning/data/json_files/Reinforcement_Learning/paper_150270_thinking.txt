To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighboring State-Based Exploration for Reinforcement Learning" by Jeffery Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses reinforcement learning and mentions the evaluation of their proposed methods, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. This is a specific dataset/environment that I need to document.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR, vol. abs/1606.01540, 2016.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Lunar Lander environment and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile this information.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Lunar Lander environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary information, I will structure the dataset entry accordingly, ready for any further processing or review.
