To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations Can Be Manipulated" by Dylan Slack et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on "loan and violent crime prediction datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, where they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic and economic information about communities across the United States, with the goal of predicting whether violent crime occurs in the community.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes financial information about individuals, and the objective is to predict whether a person is of high credit risk.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **Communities and Crime Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Both datasets are referenced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a well-known source for various datasets used in machine learning research.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
