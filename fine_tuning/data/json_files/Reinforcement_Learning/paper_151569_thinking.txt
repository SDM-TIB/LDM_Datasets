To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement-Learning based routing for packet-optical networks with hybrid telemetry" by A. L. García Navarro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses a methodology and implementation for reinforcement learning in routing, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the methodology and does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **background and methodology** section, where the authors describe the reinforcement learning approach and the metrics used for routing decisions. Here, they mention using telemetry information such as pre-FEC bit error rate and link load, but again, no specific datasets are named.

I will then look into the **simulation scenario and RL-based solution** section. This section describes a small network topology and an extended example using a Tokyo metropolitan area network (MAN) topology. While it provides details about the network configurations and the metrics used for evaluation, it does not specify any datasets that were used for training or testing the reinforcement learning algorithm.

Next, I will check the **acknowledgment** and **references** sections for any mentions of datasets or related works that might have used datasets. The references include various papers and projects, but they primarily focus on methodologies and do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they provided a methodology and open-source code for others to replicate their work. The only reference to data is the telemetry information collected from the network, which does not constitute a formal dataset citation.

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract and cite. However, I will note the open-source code provided by the authors, which could be useful for future research or experimentation.

The citation for the open-source code is:
> A. L. García Navarro, “Packet-Optical Latency-based RL,” https://github.com/alexgaarciia/PacketOpticalLatencyRL (2023).

In summary, I will document that no formal datasets were mentioned in the paper, but I will include the citation for the open-source code as a resource for further exploration.
