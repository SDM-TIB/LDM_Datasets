To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feudal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Network Partition for Traffic Signal Control" by Jinming Ma and Feng Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on real-world traffic networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they empirically evaluate their method on "real-world traffic networks of three cities." This indicates that specific datasets are used, but I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Synthetic 4x4 Traffic Grid**: This dataset is a simulated environment containing 16 intersections arranged in a 4x4 grid, with traffic volume sampled from a Gaussian distribution.

2. **Jinan Traffic Network**: This dataset consists of a real-world traffic network with 12 intersections in a 4x3 city layout, where traffic flow is generated from surveillance camera data.

3. **Hangzhou Traffic Network**: Similar to the Jinan dataset, this dataset includes a real-world traffic network with 16 intersections in a 4x4 city layout, also based on surveillance camera data.

4. **Manhattan Traffic Network**: This dataset features a real-world traffic network with 48 intersections in a 16x3 city layout, where the number of vehicles is sampled from taxi trajectory data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are either synthetic or derived from real-world traffic data, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the sources of the data:

- For the **Synthetic 4x4 Traffic Grid**, there is no formal citation as it is a simulated dataset created for the study.
- For the **Jinan Traffic Network**, the data is derived from surveillance camera data, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.
- For the **Hangzhou Traffic Network**, similar to Jinan, the data comes from surveillance camera data without a specific citation.
- For the **Manhattan Traffic Network**, the data is based on taxi trajectory data, but again, no formal citation is provided.

Since the datasets are primarily based on real-world data sources and simulations, I will summarize the findings without formal citations but will note the nature of the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
