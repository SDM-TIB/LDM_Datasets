To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VQC-Based Reinforcement Learning with Data" by Rodrigo Coelho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the environments used for testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets or environments used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention using **OpenAI Gym environments**, specifically **CartPole-v0** and **Acrobot-v1**. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these environments in the text. The authors describe **CartPole-v0** as a balancing task with a simple reward structure and **Acrobot-v1** as a more complex task involving swinging a two-link chain. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets are used.

After gathering the necessary details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets or environments mentioned. In this case, the environments are well-known benchmarks in reinforcement learning, so I will provide their standard citations:

- For **CartPole-v0**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., & Tang, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

- For **Acrobot-v1**, the citation is also:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., & Tang, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
