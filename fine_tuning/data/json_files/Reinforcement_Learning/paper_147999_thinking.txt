To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prioritized Sequence Experience Replay" by Marc Brittain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Atari 2600 benchmark**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation methodology and mention that they used the **Arcade Learning Environment** (Bellemare et al., 2013) to evaluate their proposed algorithm. This indicates that the Atari 2600 games serve as the dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific games or datasets mentioned in the results or discussion sections. The paper lists various Atari games, such as **BeamRider, Breakout, Pong, Qbert, and Seaquest**, which are part of the Atari 2600 benchmark. Each of these games can be considered a dataset in the context of reinforcement learning experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Atari 2600 Benchmark**: This benchmark includes multiple games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the benchmark is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. **Specific Games**: While the paper does not provide individual citations for each game, they are part of the Atari 2600 benchmark. Therefore, the citation for the benchmark suffices for referencing the datasets associated with these games.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or review.
