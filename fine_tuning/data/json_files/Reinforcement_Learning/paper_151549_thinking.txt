To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaZeroES: Direct score maximization outperforms planning loss minimization" by Carlos Martin and Tuomas Sandholm, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors describe several environments used for testing their approach, including:

1. **Navigation Problem**: The authors mention that this environment has been used as a benchmark by Oh et al. (2017). This indicates that there is a dataset associated with this problem, which I will need to cite.

2. **Sokoban**: The authors specify that they used the unfiltered Boxoban training set, which contains 900,000 levels of size 10 Ã— 10 each. This dataset is crucial for the Sokoban experiments.

3. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: The authors generate new problem instances for TSP on every episode, which suggests that there isn't a fixed dataset but rather a method of generating instances.

4. **Vertex k-center Problem (VKCP)**: Similar to TSP, the authors sample locations uniformly at random, indicating a generation method rather than a static dataset.

5. **Maximum Diversity Problem (MDP)**: Again, the authors sample locations uniformly at random, indicating a generation method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the experiments are as follows:

- For the **Navigation Problem**, the citation is:
  > Oh, J., Singh, S., & Lee, H. (2017). Value prediction network. In Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For the **Boxoban training set** used in Sokoban, the citation is:
  > Guez, A., Mirza, A., Gregor, K., Kabra, R., Racaniere, S., Weber, T., Silver, D., & Lillicrap, T. (2018). An investigation of model-free planning: Boxoban levels. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
