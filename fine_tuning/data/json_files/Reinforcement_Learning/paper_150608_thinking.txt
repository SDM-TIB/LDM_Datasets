To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Prioritized Resampling for Offline RL" by Yang Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference datasets that are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as they often contain concise information about the datasets' characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets' significance in the research.

Once I identify the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile a list of them, ensuring to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors. 

After gathering the dataset information, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "D4RL benchmark" or specific datasets like "halfcheetah-medium-v2," I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information into a clear format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).
3. The full citation for the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, complete with proper citations for each one.
