To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GeniL: A Multilingual Dataset on Generalizing Language" by Aida M. Davani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a new dataset called **GeniL**, which is a multilingual dataset of over 50K sentences annotated for instances of generalizations. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Generalization in Language (GeniL) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the GeniL dataset. They describe it as containing over 50K sentences from 9 languages: English, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, and Portuguese. The dataset is annotated for instances of generalizations and their types, which confirms its significance.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset was built using tuples from the **Multilingual SeeGULL (SGM) dataset** (Bhutani et al., 2024) to collect sentences that contain generalizations. This indicates that the SGM dataset is also relevant for citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **GeniL dataset**, the citation is:
   > Aida M. Davani, Sagar Gubbi, Sunipa Dev, Shachi Dave, and Vinodkumar Prabhakaran. *GeniL: A Multilingual Dataset on Generalizing Language*. Preprint. Under review.

2. For the **Multilingual SeeGULL (SGM) dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shaily Bhatt, Sunipa Dev, Partha Talukdar, Shachi Dave, and Vinodkumar Prabhakaran. *Seegull multilingual: a dataset of geo-culturally situated stereotypes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.05696.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
