To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Joint Optimization of Multiple Rewards" by Mridul Agarwal and Vaneet Aggarwal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, types of data, etc.).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay particular attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed information about each dataset used in the study. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to perform a quick search to find the authoritative source for that dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a consistent format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
