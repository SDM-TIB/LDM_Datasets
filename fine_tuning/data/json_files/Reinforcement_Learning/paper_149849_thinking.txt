To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning 'Best' Kernels from Data in Gaussian Process Regression. With Application to Aerodynamics" by Jean-Luc Akian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the algorithms and applications, which may include mentions of datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for numerical examples, specifically the **Ishigami function** and the **Rosenbrock function**. I will note these as they are essential for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **application section** where the authors discuss the RAE2822 transonic airfoil. This section may contain additional datasets related to aerodynamic simulations.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **Ishigami function**, the citation is:
> T. Ishigami and T. Homma. "An importance quantification technique in uncertainty analysis for computer models." In Proceedings First International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis, 3-5 December 1990, College Park MD, pp. 398–403, 1990.

For the **Rosenbrock function**, the citation is:
> H. H. Rosenbrock. "An automatic method for finding the greatest or least value of a function." The Computer Journal, 3(3):175–184, 1960.

For the **RAE2822 airfoil**, the citation is:
> P. H. Cook, M. A. McDonald, and M. C. P. Firmin. "Aerofoil RAE 2822—Pressure distributions, and boundary layer and wake measurements." In Experimental Data Base for Computer Program Assessment. AGARD Advisory Report No. 138, NATO, May 1979.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
