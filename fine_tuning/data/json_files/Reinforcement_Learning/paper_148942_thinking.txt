To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super-resolving Compressed Images via Parallel and Series Integration of Artefacts Removal and Resolution Enhancement" by Hongming Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a mixture of JPEG and WebP compressed images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Photograph Dataset**: This dataset is used to generate compressed images using JPEG and WebP compression methods with various quality factors. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is implied that it consists of photography images.

2. **WeChat Avatar Image Dataset**: This dataset contains low-resolution images that have undergone compression and scaling by WeChatâ€™s internal algorithms. The authors also do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is noted that it consists of real-world images collected from users.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using these datasets for their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets mentioned do not have formal citations provided in the references, as they are likely proprietary or not publicly available datasets.

Since the authors have not provided full citations for these datasets, I will note that while the datasets are described, they lack formal references. This is common in research where datasets are collected or generated by the authors themselves.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

- **Photograph Dataset**: Used for generating compressed images via JPEG and WebP methods. No formal citation provided.
- **WeChat Avatar Image Dataset**: Contains low-resolution images compressed by WeChat algorithms. No formal citation provided.

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
