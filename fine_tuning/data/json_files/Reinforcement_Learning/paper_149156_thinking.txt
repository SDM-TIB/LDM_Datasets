To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Graphs for Explainable Classification of Brain Networks" by Carlo Abrate and Francesco Bonchi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of counterfactual graphs in the context of brain networks, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the classification of brain networks and hints at the use of datasets related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Assessment on Brain Networks)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ABIDE Dataset**: This dataset is focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder and includes data from 49 individuals diagnosed with ASD and 52 control individuals labeled as Typically Developed (TD). The paper references the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) as the source.

2. **USC Multimodal Connectivity Database (USCD)**: This dataset pertains to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and includes data from 190 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 330 control individuals labeled as TD. The paper cites the ADHD200_CC200 study as the source.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ABIDE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cameron, C., et al. "The Neuro Bureau Preprocessing Initiative: Open Sharing of Preprocessed Neuroimaging Data and Derivatives." *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 7, 2013. [Link](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)

- For the **USC Multimodal Connectivity Database (USCD)**, the citation is:
  > Brown, J., Rudie, J., Bandrowski, J., Van Horn, J., and Bookheimer, S. "The UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Database: A Web-Based Platform for Brain Connectivity Matrix Sharing and Analysis." *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 6:28, 2012. [Link](http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org/umcd/default/browse_studies)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
