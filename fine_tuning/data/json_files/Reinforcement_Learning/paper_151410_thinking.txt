To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Diffusion Autoencoders: Toward Counterfactual Generation via Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Aneesh Komanduri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their framework and mention the use of datasets for empirical evaluation, which indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **MorphoMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is created by applying morphological transformations to the original MNIST dataset. The authors reference the original paper that describes this dataset.

2. **Pendulum Dataset**: This dataset consists of images depicting a physical system involving a pendulum and a light source. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

3. **CausalCircuit Dataset**: This dataset is generated to explore causal representation learning and is mentioned as being created by another referenced work.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding of the datasets' origins.

- For the **MorphoMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pawlowski, N., Coelho de Castro, D., & Glocker, B. (2019). Morpho-MNIST: Quantitative assessment and diagnostics for representation learning. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 20(178).

- For the **Pendulum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, M., Liu, F., Chen, Z., Shen, X., Hao, J., & Wang, J. (2021). CausalVAE: Disentangled representation learning via neural structural causal models. In *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

- For the **CausalCircuit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brehmer, J., De Haan, P., Lippe, P., & Cohen, T. (2022). Weakly supervised causal representation learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
