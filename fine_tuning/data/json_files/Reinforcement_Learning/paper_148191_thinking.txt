To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Representations in Reinforcement Learning: An Information Bottleneck Approach" by Yingjun Pei and Xinwen Hou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will note this and move on.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains details about the datasets employed in the study. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the experiments section. However, they refer to using reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C and PPO) in various Atari games. I will consider these games as the datasets for the experiments, as they are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will compile the relevant information regarding the datasets:

1. **Atari Games**: The authors mention using several Atari games for their experiments, including Pong, AirRaid, BeamRider, Qbert, and SpaceInvaders. These games serve as the environments where the reinforcement learning algorithms are tested.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmarks mentioned. However, since the Atari games are widely recognized and do not have a specific citation in the paper, I will reference the original source of the Atari game environments:

- For the Atari games, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V., Badia, A. P., Mirza, M., Graves, A., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., & Riedmiller, M. (2016). Asynchronous methods for deep reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 70, 1928-1937.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the Atari games as they are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

In conclusion, I will create entries for the datasets based on the information extracted from the paper, ensuring that I adhere to the requirement of including full citations for each dataset.
