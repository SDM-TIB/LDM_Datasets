To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experimental Analysis of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Spectrum Sharing Radar" by Charles E. Thornton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in a radar system, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for radar systems capable of dynamic spectrum sharing. They mention the use of a software-defined radar (SDRadar) prototype, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experimental methods section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe the radar's operation in a 100MHz spectrum shared with a non-cooperative communications system, but they do not provide specific dataset names here either.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss the performance of various RL techniques and their impact on radar detection and spectrum sharing capabilities, but they do not mention any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of related works and do not include specific datasets used in the experiments.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they did utilize a software-defined radar prototype and conducted experiments in a simulated environment with recorded LTE interference signals. Since no formal datasets are cited, I will note that the paper does not provide specific dataset citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings regarding the absence of named datasets in the paper and document this in a structured format for clarity.
