To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Speech Separation with Ad Hoc Microphone Arrays" by Dongmei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **AdHoc-LibriCSS**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the evaluation data. Here, they provide detailed information about the **AdHoc-LibriCSS** dataset, including its composition and how it was created. The dataset consists of recordings of concatenated LibriSpeech utterances played back from loudspeakers to simulate conversations, recorded with various consumer devices.

In the **evaluation data subsection**, the authors specify that the dataset includes recordings made in different scenarios (2-speaker and 5-speaker) and provides details about the recording conditions, such as the number of loudspeakers, duration, and subsets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and intended use.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. The authors reference the **LibriSpeech** dataset, which is foundational for the **AdHoc-LibriCSS** dataset. The citation for the **LibriSpeech** dataset is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since **AdHoc-LibriCSS** is derived from **LibriSpeech**, I will include this citation as the authoritative source for the utterances used in the new dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citations for both **AdHoc-LibriCSS** and **LibriSpeech**. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
