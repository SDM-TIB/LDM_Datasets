To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Navigation: Training Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning in CARLA" by Ghadi Nehme and Tejas Y. Deo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, implementation, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator**, which is a key component of the research, but I need to check if any specific datasets are referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the CARLA simulator and its capabilities, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **implementation section** to see if any datasets are used for training or testing the models.

In **section 3 (Implementation)**, the authors describe the use of the CARLA simulator for training autonomous vehicles, but again, they do not specify any datasets. They mention testing on **4 different trajectories**, which are likely generated within the CARLA environment rather than external datasets.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any references to datasets used for evaluation. The results focus on the performance of the models on the trajectories, but do not mention any external datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of papers discussing the CARLA simulator and related methodologies, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments; instead, they relied on the CARLA simulator to generate the necessary data for training and testing their models.

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. However, I will note that the CARLA simulator itself is a significant tool used in the research, and it is worth mentioning in the context of the study.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings regarding the use of the CARLA simulator and the absence of external datasets in the paper.
