To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LONGHORN: STATE SPACE MODELS ARE AMORTIZED ONLINE LEARNERS" by Bo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SlimPajama Dataset**: The authors state that they trained a 1.3B parameter model on the SlimPajama dataset with 100B tokens. This dataset is crucial for their language modeling experiments.

2. **OpenWebText Dataset**: The paper mentions using the OpenWebText dataset for language modeling tasks, which is another significant dataset for their evaluations.

3. **Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR)**: While this is a benchmark rather than a dataset in the traditional sense, it is important to note as it is used for evaluating the model's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **SlimPajama Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daria Soboleva, Faisal Al-Khateeb, Robert Myers, Jacob R Steeves. *A 627B token cleaned version of RedPajama*. 2023. URL: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B.

- For the **OpenWebText Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aaron Gokaslan and Vanya Cohen. *OpenWebText Corpus*. 2019. URL: http://Skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus.

- The **Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR)** benchmark is referenced in the paper but does not have a specific citation as it is a benchmark created by the authors of the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
