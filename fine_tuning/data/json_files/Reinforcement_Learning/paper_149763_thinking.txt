To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting and Optimizing for Energy Efficient ACMV Systems: Computational Intelligence Approaches" by Deqing Zhai and Yeng Chai Soh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions optimization algorithms and thermal comfort predictions, it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of energy consumption in buildings and the role of HVAC systems, but it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details regarding the data used for training the neural networks or for the optimization algorithms. The authors mention that the neural network models of energy consumption, ambient air temperature, and air velocity were developed based on earlier studies, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

In the **experimental results and discussion section**, I will check if the authors refer to any datasets used for their experiments. They discuss the performance of the Bayesian Gaussian Process Optimization (BGPO) and Augmented Firefly Algorithm (AFA) but do not mention specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous studies. The references include various studies related to energy consumption, thermal comfort, and HVAC systems, but again, they do not explicitly mention datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not provide specific datasets or their citations. Instead, they reference their earlier works and methodologies without detailing the datasets used. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no explicit datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and results related to energy-efficient ACMV systems, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the study.
