To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL Unplugged: A Suite of Benchmarks for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Caglar Gulcehre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a benchmark suite called **RL Unplugged**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of offline reinforcement learning and mention various environments and datasets. They specifically highlight the inclusion of datasets from the **DM Control Suite** and **Atari 2600 games**, which are key components of their benchmark.

In the **section titled "RL Unplugged"**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets included in their benchmark. They mention several specific datasets:

1. **DM Control Suite**: This suite includes various control tasks implemented in MuJoCo, with datasets generated using different algorithms. The authors note that they used D4PG and V-MPO to generate data for specific tasks.

2. **DM Locomotion**: This section describes datasets generated for locomotion tasks involving a humanoid and a virtual rodent. The authors mention that these datasets were created using expert policies and include egocentric camera observations.

3. **Atari 2600**: The authors describe a large dataset generated from an online DQN agent, which includes gameplay data from 46 Atari games. They specify that the dataset follows the protocol described by Agarwal et al. (2020).

4. **Real-world Reinforcement Learning Suite**: This suite includes datasets generated from tasks that reflect real-world challenges, such as Cartpole Swingup and Walker Walk.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **DM Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T. P., & Riedmiller, M. A. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. CoRR, abs/1801.00690.

- For **Atari 2600**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253â€“279.

- For **Real-world Reinforcement Learning Suite**, the citation is:
  > Dulac-Arnold, G., Mankowitz, D., & Hester, T. (2020). *An Empirical Investigation of the Challenges of Real-World Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
