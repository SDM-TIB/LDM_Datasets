To extract datasets from the research paper titled "schlably: A Python Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Scheduling Experiments" by Constantin Waubert de Puiseau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the need for a standardized framework but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **background and related work section** and the **software architecture section**. Here, the authors discuss various scheduling problems and frameworks but still do not provide specific dataset names. 

I will then examine the **experiments section** (if present) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for testing or benchmarking their framework. In this case, the authors mention that the framework provides benchmark datasets for different scheduling problem classes and sizes, but they do not specify the names of these datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets. The references include various papers and GitHub repositories related to job shop scheduling and reinforcement learning, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors mention the availability of benchmark datasets, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. Therefore, I will note that the paper does not contain explicit dataset information that can be extracted.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper discusses the availability of benchmark datasets for scheduling problems but does not specify any dataset names or provide citations.
- No datasets can be extracted from this paper for documentation purposes.

Since there are no datasets to document, I will not create any entries or citations. However, I will keep in mind that future papers may provide more explicit dataset information that can be extracted and cited accordingly.
