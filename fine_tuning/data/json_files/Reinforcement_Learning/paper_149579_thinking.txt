To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Awareness Safety of Deep Reinforcement Learning in Road Traffic Junction Driving" by Zehong Cao and Jie Yun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on safety performance in autonomous driving, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the experimental setup. This section often contains details about the environments or datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any references to specific datasets or simulation environments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the driving scenarios used for testing the models, specifically mentioning "intersection" and "roundabout" scenarios. However, I need to confirm whether these scenarios are based on existing datasets or if they are custom simulations created for this study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited that may have been used in the experiments. This could include foundational datasets for reinforcement learning in traffic scenarios or any specific datasets related to autonomous driving.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a specific simulation environment or dataset, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identifying specific datasets or simulation environments used in the experiments.
3. Checking the references for citations related to these datasets.
4. Compiling the dataset information and citations for clarity and proper attribution.
