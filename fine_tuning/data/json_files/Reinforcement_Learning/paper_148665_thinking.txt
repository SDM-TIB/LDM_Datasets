To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Twitter to traffic predictor: Next-day morning traffic prediction using social media data" by Weiran Yao and Sean Qian, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be discussed. The abstract mentions using Twitter messages and various traffic datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (Section 2) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they outline three main sources of data:

1. **INRIX Speed Dataset**: This dataset contains historical traffic speed data covering major highways in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The authors specify that it includes 4,254 TMCs and focuses on 53 major highway segments where congestion is observed.

2. **PennDOT RCRS Incident Dataset**: This dataset provides real-time information about traffic incidents, roadwork, and other events on state-owned roads. The authors mention that in 2014, there were 2,696 traffic incidents reported in Pittsburgh.

3. **Weather Underground Dataset**: This dataset includes hourly weather measurements such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, collected from the Pittsburgh International Airport.

4. **Twitter Dataset**: The authors describe their Twitter dataset, which consists of 1,782,636 tweets collected from January 23, 2014, to December 31, 2014. This dataset includes both geocoded and non-geocoded tweets.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will include are:

- For the **INRIX Speed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > INRIX. *INRIX Traffic Data*. Available at: https://inrix.com/products/ai-traffic/.

- For the **PennDOT RCRS Incident Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. *Road Condition Report System (RCRS) Incident Data*. Available at: https://www.penndot.gov/Doing-Business/OnlineServices/Pages/Developer-Resources.aspx.

- For the **Weather Underground Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weather Underground. *Weather Data*. Available at: https://www.wunderground.com/.

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Twitter. *Twitter Streaming API*. Available at: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
