To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Title of the Paper" by Author(s), I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. If the authors reference any datasets, I will take note of their names and any context provided.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** or **approach** section, as this is where authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including how they were used, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Following that, I will focus on the **experiments** or **results** section. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation, including any performance metrics reported. I will ensure to note down any datasets mentioned here, as they are critical for understanding the context of the experiments.

If the paper has a dedicated **datasets** section, I will review it thoroughly. This section often provides comprehensive details about each dataset, including the number of samples, types of annotations, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will refer to the **references** or **bibliography** section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For each dataset, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of its contents and purpose.
3. The full citation as it appears in the references section.

Once I have compiled all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
