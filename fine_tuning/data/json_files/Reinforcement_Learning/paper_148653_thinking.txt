To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating and Mitigating Bias in Image Classifiers: A Causal Perspective Using Counterfactuals" by Saloni Dash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Morpho-MNIST dataset** and the **CelebA dataset** for generating counterfactuals and evaluating biases in image classifiers. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. The authors state that they evaluated their method on the **Morpho-MNIST dataset** and the **CelebA dataset**, confirming their significance in the experiments.

In the **datasets section**, the paper provides specific details about each dataset:

1. **Morpho-MNIST**: This dataset is based on the original MNIST dataset but includes interpretable attributes like thickness and intensity. It was extended to introduce morphological transformations with a known causal graph. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Castro, D. C., Tan, J., Kainz, B., Konukoglu, E., & Glocker, B. (2019). Morpho-MNIST: Quantitative assessment and diagnostics for representation learning. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 20(178), 1-29.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset consists of 200,000 celebrity images annotated with 40 attributes, including hair color and facial features. The authors used it to evaluate biases in their image classifier. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, December 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in further research or applications.
