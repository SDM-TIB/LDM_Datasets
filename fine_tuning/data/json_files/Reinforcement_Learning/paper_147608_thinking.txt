To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Mix n-Step Returns: Generalizing λ-Returns for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Sahil Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. If no datasets are mentioned here, I will proceed to the **introduction**.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on..." or "we used the following datasets...".

After that, I will focus on the **experimental setup** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the datasets' characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training/test splits).

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Atari 2600 domain**. I will look for specific references to datasets related to Atari games, as this is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Arcade Learning Environment**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 47:253–279, 2013.

If the paper references any specific datasets from other works, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
