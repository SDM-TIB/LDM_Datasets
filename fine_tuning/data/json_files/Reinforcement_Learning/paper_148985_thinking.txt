To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants from the coevolution of viruses and policy interventions" by Aymeric Vié, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, model, results, and references sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the emergence of various COVID-19 variants and mentions the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to model the coevolution of viruses and policy interventions. However, no specific datasets are named here.

Next, I will examine the **model section**, where the author describes the simulation setup. The author mentions a population distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants with identified genome sequences and traits, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

In the **results section**, the author discusses findings related to the evolution of viruses under different policy interventions, but there are no datasets explicitly referenced.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any studies or datasets that may have been used indirectly. The references include various studies related to COVID-19, genetic algorithms, and policy interventions, but they do not specify any datasets that were directly utilized in the research.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will note that while the author refers to simulation data and results, there are no publicly available datasets cited in the paper. The only mention of data is related to the simulation code available at a GitHub repository, which may contain relevant data for replication but is not a formal dataset citation.

Now, I will compile my findings. Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude that the paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction. However, I will mention the GitHub repository as a source of simulation data.

The citation for the GitHub repository is:
> Aymeric Vié. *Covid19_coevolution*. Available at: https://github.com/aymericvie/Covid19_coevolution.

In summary, I will document that no formal datasets were extracted from the paper, but I will reference the GitHub repository for simulation data.
