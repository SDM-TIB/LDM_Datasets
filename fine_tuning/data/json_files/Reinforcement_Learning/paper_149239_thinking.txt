To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Counterfactual Generation for Fair Hate Speech Detection" by Aida Mostafazadeh Davani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of counterfactual fairness in hate speech detection, which suggests that datasets related to hate speech are likely involved. The introduction further discusses the challenges of bias in hate speech detection, hinting at the presence of specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1**, the authors specify that they used two primary datasets for their experiments:

1. **Gab Hate Corpus (GHC)**: This dataset is described as an annotated corpus of English social media posts from the far-right network "Gab," containing approximately 27,000 posts. The dataset includes labels for hate speech, specifically targeting "Call for Violence" and "Human Degradation."

2. **Stormfront Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as an annotated corpus of English posts from a white supremacy forum, containing around 11,000 posts. It is also annotated for hate speech.

In addition to these primary datasets, the authors mention using other datasets for evaluating fairness metrics:

- **Dissimilar Counterfactuals (DC)**: This dataset is collected from Nadeem et al. (2020) and contains stereotypical sentences and their counterfactuals.

- **Similar Counterfactuals (SC)**: This dataset consists of synthetic English sentences generated by Dixon et al. (2018).

I will now look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Gab Hate Corpus (GHC)**, the citation is:

- For the **Stormfront Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Dissimilar Counterfactuals (DC)**, the citation is:
  > Moin Nadeem, Anna Bethke, and Siva Reddy. *Stereoset: Measuring Stereotypical Bias in Pretrained Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456, 2020.

- For the **Similar Counterfactuals (SC)**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
