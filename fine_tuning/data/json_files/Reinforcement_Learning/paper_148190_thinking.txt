To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Buffer-aware Wireless Scheduling based on Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Chen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and relevance to the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any numerical results or experiments that indicate the use of datasets. If the authors mention any specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider any supplementary materials or appendices that may contain additional information about the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant information is included for each dataset identified in the paper.
