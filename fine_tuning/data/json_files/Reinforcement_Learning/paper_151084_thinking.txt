To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Partial Dynamics Knowledge" by Meshal Alharbi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments.

While reading through the paper, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For instance, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will record its name and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the "OpenAI Gym" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
