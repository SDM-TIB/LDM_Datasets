To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Encoded Observation Spaces for Perceptive Reinforcement Learning" by Lev Grossman and Brian Plancher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using "three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms" and mentions the Atari 2600 benchmark and the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). This suggests that datasets related to these benchmarks are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors detail their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention using tasks from the **Atari 2600 benchmark** and the **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**. I will look for specific references to datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors state that they evaluate their approach across ten Atari 2600 benchmark tasks and two robotic control tasks from the DMC. This indicates that the datasets are the Atari 2600 environments and the DMC tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **Atari 2600 benchmark**: The citation for the Atari 2600 environments is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253â€“279. https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.3912

2. **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**: The citation for the DMC is:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., & Riedmiller, M. (2018). DeepMind control suite. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Atari 2600 benchmark**: A collection of environments used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, consisting of various classic arcade games.
- **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**: A suite of continuous control tasks designed for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms in simulated robotic environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.
