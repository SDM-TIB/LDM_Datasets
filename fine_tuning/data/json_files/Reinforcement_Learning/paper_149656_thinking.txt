To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling R-GCN Training with Graph Summarization" by Alessandro Generale et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors obtained reasonable results on the **AIFB**, **MUTAG**, and **AM** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** and **Experiments** sections, particularly section 5, which is explicitly titled "DATA SETS." Here, the authors provide statistics for the datasets used in their experiments, confirming the names of the datasets mentioned earlier:

1. **AIFB Dataset**: The statistics indicate it contains 23,644 entities, 8,285 relations, 74,227 edges, and 45 classes.
2. **MUTAG Dataset**: This dataset has 333,845 entities, 103 relations, 916,199 edges, and 1 class.
3. **AM Dataset**: The largest dataset with 1,666,764 entities, 133 relations, 5,988,321 edges, and 21 classes.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference previous works that describe these datasets:

- For the **AIFB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Bloem, Xander Wilcke, Lucas van Berkel, and Victor de Boer. *kgbench: A Collection of Knowledge Graph Datasets for Evaluating Relational and Multimodal Machine Learning*. In The Semantic Web, Springer International Publishing, Cham, 614–630, 2021. https://openreview.net/forum?id=yeK_9wxRDbA

- For the **MUTAG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thiviyan Thanapalasingam, Lucas van Berkel, Peter Bloem, and Paul Groth. *Relational Graph Convolutional Networks: A Closer Look*. arXiv:2107.10015 [cs.LG], 2021.

- For the **AM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Bloem, Xander Wilcke, Lucas van Berkel, and Victor de Boer. *kgbench: A Collection of Knowledge Graph Datasets for Evaluating Relational and Multimodal Machine Learning*. In The Semantic Web, Springer International Publishing, Cham, 614–630, 2021. https://openreview.net/forum?id=yeK_9wxRDbA

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
