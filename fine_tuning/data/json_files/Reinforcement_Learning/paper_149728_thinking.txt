To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale Invariant Semantic Segmentation with RGB-D Fusion" by Mohammad Dawud Ansari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed evaluations on the **Cityscapes** dataset and a synthetic dataset generated using **CARLA**. This suggests that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale outdoor scene dataset recorded across 50 German cities, containing RGB-D pairs with pixel-wise fine-annotation labels. The dataset includes 2975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1525 test images, along with 20,000 extra training images with coarse annotations.

2. **CARLA Dataset**: The authors mention that they generated a synthetic dataset using the CARLA simulator, which includes 5000 training and 500 validation RGB-D image pairs.

3. **Zed Dataset**: They also refer to a self-recorded real dataset captured using a Zed stereo camera, although details about the number of images or annotations are not provided.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

- For the **CARLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In *Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning*.

- For the **Zed Dataset**, since it is self-recorded and does not have a formal citation, I will note it as a self-generated dataset without a specific reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for Cityscapes and CARLA, while noting the Zed dataset as a self-recorded dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
