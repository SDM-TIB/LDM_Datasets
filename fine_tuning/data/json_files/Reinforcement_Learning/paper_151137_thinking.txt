To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM for Sleep State Classification of Spatiotemporal Wide-Field Calcium Imaging Data" by Xiaohui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to data sources or datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) and its application in sleep studies. They mention that WFCI data is manually scored into sleep states, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details about it.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Expert behavioral state scoring." Here, the authors describe the collection of data, stating that they collected a total of 19,155 10-second epochs for the dataset, which includes wakefulness, NREM, and REM sleep states. This section is crucial as it provides quantitative details about the dataset.

The authors also mention that the dataset was randomly shuffled and split into training, validation, and testing sets. This indicates that the dataset is structured for machine learning purposes.

I will also check the **data and source code availability section** to see if there are any references to where the dataset can be accessed. The authors mention that part of the WFCI sleep data is available on PhysioNet, which is a significant detail for citation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The key dataset identified is the WFCI sleep data, which is available on PhysioNet. I will also note the relevant citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the WFCI sleep data, the citation is:
  > Landsness, Eric, and Zhang, Xiaohui. *Wide-Field Calcium Imaging Sleep Data*. PhysioNet. [Link to dataset if available].

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for each dataset based on the information gathered. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
