To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PyTAG: Tabletop Games for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Martin Balla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the PyTAG framework and its application to various tabletop games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **background and games sections** where the authors describe the specific games used in their experiments. In the games section, they mention several tabletop games, including:

1. **Tic Tac Toe**: A simple game played on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Diamant**: A push-your-luck game for 2 to 5 players.
3. **Love Letter**: A card game for 2 to 4 players.
4. **Exploding Kittens**: A card game for 2 to 5 players.
5. **Stratego**: A strategy game for 2 players.
6. **Sushi Go!**: A drafting card game for 2 to 5 players.
7. **Dots and Boxes**: A game for 2 or more players.

Each game is described in terms of its mechanics, player interactions, and the challenges it presents for reinforcement learning.

After identifying these games, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or frameworks mentioned. The authors reference the TAG framework, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. The relevant citation for the TAG framework is:

- R. Gaina, M. Balla, A. Dockhorn, R. Montoliu Col√°s, and D. Perez. "TAG: A tabletop games framework." CEUR Workshop Proc., 2020.

Additionally, I will look for any specific papers or sources that detail the datasets for the individual games mentioned. If the authors refer to any specific datasets or provide citations for them, I will ensure to include those as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding sources.
