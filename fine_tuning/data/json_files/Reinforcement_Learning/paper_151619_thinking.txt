To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Efficient Long-Horizon Exploration in Monte Carlo Tree Search through State Occupancy Regularization" by Liam Schramm and Abdeslam Boularias, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention testing their method on **several robot navigation problems**. I will look for specific datasets related to these problems. If the datasets are not named directly in the experiments section, I will check the **background or related work sections** for any references to datasets that may have been used in similar studies.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Robot Navigation Dataset," I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
