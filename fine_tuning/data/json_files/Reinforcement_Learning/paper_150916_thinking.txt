To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MiniZero: Comparative Analysis of AlphaZero and MuZero on Go, Othello, and Atari Games" by Ti-Rong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates performance across various games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be discussed.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation, particularly in the context of the games mentioned (9x9 Go, 8x8 Othello, and 57 Atari games).

In Section IV-A, the authors describe the training procedures and settings for the algorithms. They mention using two board games (9x9 Go and 8x8 Othello) and 57 Atari games, but I need to find specific dataset names or references.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original papers or sources for these datasets.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **9x9 Go**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the AlphaZero and MuZero algorithms. The specific dataset is not cited in detail, but it is implied to be based on the game of Go.

2. **8x8 Othello**: Similar to the Go dataset, this dataset is used for training and evaluation. Again, specific citation details are not provided, but it is understood to be based on the game of Othello.

3. **Atari Games**: The paper mentions using 57 Atari games for evaluation. The specific datasets for these games are not detailed in the text, but they are commonly known datasets used in reinforcement learning research.

Next, I will look for any references that provide full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the Atari games, I will refer to the original Atari Learning Environment paper for the dataset citation.

The citations I will include are:

- For **9x9 Go**:
  > Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C. J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., van den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Antonoglou, I., Panneershelvam, V., & Hassabis, D. (2016). Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search. *Nature*, 529(7587), 484-489.

- For **8x8 Othello**:
  > Silver, D., Schrittwieser, J., Simonyan, K., Antonoglou, I., Huang, A., Guez, A., Hubert, T., Baker, L., Lai, M., Bolton, A., Chen, Y., Lillicrap, T., Sifre, L., van den Driessche, G., Graepel, T., & Hassabis, D. (2017). Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge. *Nature*, 550(7676), 354-359.

- For **Atari Games**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: an evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
