To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependency-aware Attention Control for Unconstrained Face Recognition with Image Sets" by Xiaofeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the paper addresses image set-based face verification and identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several datasets, including **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** and **YouTube Faces (YTF)**, indicating that these datasets are used for face verification tasks. They also mention the **IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A)**, which is described as a benchmark for unconstrained face verification and identification.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on three datasets: **IJB-A**, **YTF**, and **Celebrity-1000**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **IJB-A Dataset**:
   > Klare, B.F., Klein, B., Taborsky, E., Blanton, A., Cheney, J., Allen, K., Grother, P., Mah, A., Jain, A.K. "Pushing the frontiers of unconstrained face detection and recognition: Iarpa janus benchmark a." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, pp. 1931–1939.

2. **YouTube Faces (YTF) Dataset**:
   > Wolf, L., Hassner, T., Maoz, I. "Face recognition in unconstrained videos with matched background similarity." In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011 IEEE Conference on, pp. 529–534.

3. **Celebrity-1000 Dataset**:
   > Liu, L., Zhang, L., Liu, H., Yan, S. "Toward large-population face identification in unconstrained videos." IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 2014, 24(11): 1874–1884.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
