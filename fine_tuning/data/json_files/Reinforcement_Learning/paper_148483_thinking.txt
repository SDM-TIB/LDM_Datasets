To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration by Maximizing R´enyi Entropy for Reward-Free RL Framework" by Jian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract discusses the exploration phase where the agent collects a dataset of transitions, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but it does not specify its name.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their exploration framework and mention that a dataset of trajectories is collected by executing learned exploratory policies. However, I need to find specific names and details of any datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on several environments, including **MultiRooms**, **Atari**, and **Mujoco**. I will check if these environments correspond to specific datasets or if they are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the information about the datasets. If the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will reference the environments used in the experiments as they often correspond to established datasets in the field.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. If the authors refer to standard datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to include their original citations.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari** environments, I will cite the relevant paper that introduced the Atari Learning Environment:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Machado, M. C., Bellemare, M. G., Talvitie, E., Veness, J., Hausknecht, M. J., & Bowling, M. (2018). Revisiting the Arcade Learning Environment: Evaluation Protocols and Open Problems for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 61, 523–562.

If the paper mentions **Mujoco**, I will include its citation as well:

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In *2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems* (pp. 5026–5033). IEEE.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that each dataset or environment is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
