To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attacking Motion Planners Using Adversarial Perception Errors" by Jonathan Sadeghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulator or specific scenarios tested within it.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **nuScenes dataset** for evaluating their perception system. This is a clear indication that I need to extract this dataset.

In **section 5.1 (System Setup)**, the authors specify that they use the **BEVFusion 3D object detector** on the **nuScenes dataset**. They also describe the metrics used for evaluation, which further confirms the relevance of this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **nuScenes dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **CARLA simulator** but do not provide a specific dataset citation for it, as it is primarily a simulation environment rather than a dataset itself.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **nuScenes dataset** as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **nuScenes dataset** based on the information collected, ensuring that it is ready for any required structured output or further processing.
