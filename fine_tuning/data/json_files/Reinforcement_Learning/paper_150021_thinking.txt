To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair learning with Wasserstein barycenters for non-decomposable performance measures" by Solenne Gaucher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely, as it is likely to provide comprehensive details about the datasets used in the research. This section may include descriptions of the datasets, their sources, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
