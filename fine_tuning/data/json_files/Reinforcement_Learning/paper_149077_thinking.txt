To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Based Soft Actor Critic for Environments with Non-stationary Dynamics" by Yuan Pu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results show the performance of the proposed LC-SAC method on the **MetaWorld ML1 tasks** and the **MuJoCo** continuous control benchmark task. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. They explicitly mention:

1. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control, which includes various tasks like Ant-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, and Humanoid-v2. The paper states that MuJoCo is widely used in reinforcement learning research.

2. **MetaWorld ML1**: This environment encapsulates multiple tasks, including reach-v2, push-v2, and pick-place-v2, which are designed for robotic manipulation tasks. The authors note that the dynamics change significantly across episodes in this environment.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. 

- For **MetaWorld ML1**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., et al. (2019). *Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement Learning*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
