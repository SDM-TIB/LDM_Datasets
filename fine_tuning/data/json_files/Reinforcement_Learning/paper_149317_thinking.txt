To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning on Encrypted Data" by Alberto Jesu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the application of reinforcement learning (RL) on encrypted data but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the motivation and background of the study, focusing on privacy concerns in RL, but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **approach** section, I will look for any descriptions of environments or datasets used for training the RL agents. The authors mention using OpenAI Gym environments, specifically **MiniGrid** and **LunarLander**, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the environments in which they conducted their experiments. They mention that they used the **MiniGrid** environment, which is a collection of grid-based tasks, and the **LunarLander** environment, which is a continuous control task. However, they do not provide formal dataset citations for these environments.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with citations, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find the original sources for the environments mentioned. 

1. For **MiniGrid**, the citation is:
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

2. For **LunarLander**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now that I have identified the relevant environments and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. 

Overall, while the paper does not explicitly mention datasets in the traditional sense, it does reference environments that serve as datasets for the RL experiments, and I have gathered the necessary citations for those environments.
