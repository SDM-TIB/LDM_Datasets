To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unfooling Perturbation-Based Post Hoc Explainers" by Zachariah Carmichael and Walter J. Scheirer, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on several high-stakes real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset was collected by ProPublica in 2016 for defendants from Broward County, Florida. It includes attributes of individuals used by the COMPAS algorithm to assign recidivism risk scores.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset was donated to the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository in 1994. It comprises attributes for German individuals and their corresponding lender risk.

3. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: This dataset combines socio-economic US census data from 1990, US Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey data from 1990, and US FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data from 1995. It includes covariates describing individual communities that are posited to be predictive of crime rates.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine bias: there’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks. ProPublica. Retrieved from https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data).

- For the **Communities and Crime Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
