To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte-Carlo Planning: Theoretically Fast Convergence Meets Practical Efficiency" by Zohar Feldman and Carmel Domshlak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting evaluations on benchmarks from the International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC-2011). This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these benchmarks.

I will then look for any explicit names of datasets or benchmarks in the **results section** or any tables that summarize the performance of the algorithms. The authors mention five domains: **Game-of-Life, SysAdmin, Traffic, Crossing, and Navigation**. These domains are likely associated with specific datasets used for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. If the datasets are derived from previously published works, I will ensure to cite those original sources.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset or benchmark.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains or its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I identify the **IPPC-2011 benchmarks**, I will look for the original source that describes these benchmarks and provide the citation accordingly.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
