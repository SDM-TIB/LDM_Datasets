To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations for Arbitrary Regression Models" by Thomas Spooner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its evaluation, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method in the context of logistic regression. The authors describe the dataset and its relevance to the counterfactual explanations they are generating.

2. **NYC Taxi Trip Duration Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluation, specifically to explore the impact of sparsity and satisfication on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

For the **NYC Taxi Trip Duration Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Playground prediction competition: New York City taxi trip duration*, 2017. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future use.
