To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Earthquakes and the Wealth of Nations: The Cases of Chile and New Zealand" by Diego Díaz, Pablo Paniagua, and Cristián Larroulet, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the economic impact of earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to economic indicators and disaster impacts.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the synthetic control method (SCM) they used. This section typically includes details about the data sources and the specific datasets employed for the analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and the variables they contain.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to specific datasets used to analyze the economic impacts of the earthquakes. The authors may provide insights into the data they collected or utilized from existing databases.

I will also examine the **references section** to identify any datasets that are cited. This may include databases like EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database) or other relevant economic datasets that the authors relied upon for their analysis.

Based on my reading, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors mention using the EM-DAT database, I will note it down along with its citation:

- **EM-DAT (2018)**: Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. *The International Disaster Database*. Available at: http://www.emdat.be/.

If they reference specific economic datasets or reports, I will extract those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for understanding the empirical basis of their findings.
