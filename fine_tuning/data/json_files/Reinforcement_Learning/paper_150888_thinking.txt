To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEAR: A GPU-Centric Experience Replay System for Large Reinforcement Learning Models" by Hanjing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the GEAR system's capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction highlights the importance of experience replay systems in reinforcement learning and mentions several models and environments, which may lead to dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Background and Motivation)**, where the authors discuss various datasets used in reinforcement learning. Here, they mention specific datasets such as **D4RL**, **Minecraft**, and **robot manipulation** datasets. This section provides context on how these datasets are utilized in training large RL models.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the models they tested with GEAR. They specifically mention that the GATO model was trained with a dataset containing **100 TB of trajectories**, which is a significant dataset reference. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any relevant citations related to the datasets mentioned. Here are the citations I found:

1. **D4RL**:
   > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., and Levine, S. "D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

2. **Minecraft**:
   > Fan, L., Wang, G., Jiang, Y., Mandlekar, A., Yang, Y., Zhu, H., Tang, A., Huang, D.-A., Zhu, Y., and Anandkumar, A. "Minedojo: Building Open-Ended Embodied Agents with Internet-Scale Knowledge." arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.08853, 2022.

3. **Robot Manipulation**:
   > Jang, E., Irpan, A., Khansari, M., Kappler, D., Ebert, F., Lynch, C., Levine, S., and Finn, C. "BC-Z: Zero-Shot Task Generalization with Robotic Imitation Learning." In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 991â€“1002. PMLR, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
