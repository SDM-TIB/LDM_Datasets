To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Experience Replay: a Bag of Tricks for Continual Learning" by Pietro Buzzega et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **Section V (Experimental Results)**, where they outline the specific datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Split Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset consists of five tasks featuring two classes each, with 6000 exemplars per class. It is based on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
2. **Split CIFAR-10**: This dataset is organized into five tasks with two classes each, containing 5000 examples per class from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
3. **Split CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of ten tasks, each with ten distinct classes and 500 exemplars per class, derived from the CIFAR-100 dataset.
4. **Split CORe-50**: This dataset includes 50 classes with around 2400 examples per class, organized into nine tasks.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Rep.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Rep.

- For **CORe-50**, the citation is:
  > Maltoni, D., & Lomonaco, V. (2019). *Continuous learning in single-incremental-task scenarios*. Neural Networks.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
