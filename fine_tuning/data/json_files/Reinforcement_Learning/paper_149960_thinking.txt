To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Decision Making at the Intersection for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Skill Discovery" by Xianqi He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA simulator for testing the proposed method, which suggests that there may be a dataset or simulation environment involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), where the authors describe the simulation environment and the intersection scenario designed in CARLA. This section is likely to provide specific details about the datasets or environments used for the experiments.

In Section III, the authors mention that they designed an intersection scenario in the CARLA simulator, which is a well-known open-source urban driving simulator. This indicates that the CARLA simulator itself is a dataset or environment used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the research.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Conference on robot learning, 2017, pp. 1-16: PMLR.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the CARLA simulator for their experiments, I will document this as the main dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as required. This will provide a clear and accurate representation of the dataset utilized in the study.
