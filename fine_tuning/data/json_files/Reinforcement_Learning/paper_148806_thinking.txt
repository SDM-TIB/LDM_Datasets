To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Coverage and Capacity in Cellular Networks using Machine Learning" by Ryan M. Dreifuerst et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of a simulation model for evaluating optimization methods, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the simulations.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Simulation Data Generation)**, where the authors describe the RF Reference Signal Receive Power (RSRP) maps. They mention using a MATLAB tool suite called **QuaDRiGa** to simulate the RF coverage maps. This indicates that the simulation data generated is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the simulated RF coverage maps generated by QuaDRiGa.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QuaDRiGa tool, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the research.

The citation for QuaDRiGa is:
> F. Burkhardt, S. Jaeckel, E. Eberlein, and R. Prieto-Cerdeira. *QuaDRiGa: A MIMO channel model for land mobile satellite*. In European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2014), 2014, pp. 1274â€“1278.

Since the paper primarily relies on the simulated RF coverage maps generated by QuaDRiGa, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
