To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-LEARNING BASED SYSTEM FOR PATH PLANNING WITH UAV SWARMS IN OBSTACLE ENVIRONMENTS" by Alejandro Puente-Castro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets or experimental setups. The abstract discusses the use of five maps of different sizes with various obstacles for experimentation, which indicates that these maps are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction mentions the need for UAVs to operate in environments with obstacles and hints at the use of specific maps for testing the proposed system. However, it does not provide specific names or citations for the datasets.

I will then look into **section 3 (Materials and Method)**, particularly the subsection titled **3.2 Flight Environments Set**. Here, the authors describe the five maps used for experimentation in detail:

1. **5x5 Cell Map**: Simulates tree crops arranged in a regular pattern.
2. **6x6 Cell Map**: Introduces obstacles that require UAVs to make turns and move backward.
3. **7x7 Cell Map**: Tests UAV behavior in a non-symmetrical environment.
4. **8x8 Cell Map**: Features diagonal arrangements of obstacles.
5. **9x9 Cell Map**: Includes a single large obstacle that UAVs must navigate around.

These maps are critical to the experiments and serve as the datasets for the study.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since these maps are likely original contributions of the authors, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. In this case, I will note that the maps are described in the paper but do not have external citations.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of the maps as datasets, along with a note indicating that they are original contributions without external citations.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
