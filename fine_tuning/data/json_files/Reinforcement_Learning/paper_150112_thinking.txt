To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modular Flows: Differential Molecular Generation" by Yogesh Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **QM9** and **ZINC250K** benchmarks. This indicates that these two datasets are likely to be significant for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly state that they trained and evaluated their models on the **ZINC250k** dataset, which contains 250,000 drug-like molecules, and the **QM9** dataset, which consists of 134,000 stable small organic molecules. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1, 2014.

2. For the **ZINC250K dataset**, the citation is:
   > John J Irwin, Teague Sterling, Michael M Mysinger, Erin S Bolstad, and Ryan G Coleman. *ZINC: a free tool to discover chemistry for biology*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(7):1757â€“1768, 2012.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **QM9 Dataset**: A dataset containing 134,000 stable small organic molecules, used for evaluating molecular generation models.
- **ZINC250K Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 250,000 drug-like molecules, also utilized for training and evaluating the models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
