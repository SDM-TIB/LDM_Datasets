To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generation of Synthetic Electronic Medical Record Text" by Jiaqi Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a Chinese EMR text dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of using real EMR data due to privacy concerns and the need for synthetic datasets. They mention the goal of generating synthetic EMR texts, but I need to find the specific dataset they used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, particularly under **section V.A (Dataset)**, the authors provide details about the dataset they collected. They state that they collected **2,216 EMR texts from the respiration department of a hospital**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note its characteristics, such as the types of diseases included (pneumonia and lung cancer) and the preprocessing steps taken.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's details as follows:

- **Chinese EMR Text Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,216 electronic medical records collected from the respiration department of a hospital. The records include personal information, chief complaints, and diagnostic results, with sensitive information removed to protect patient privacy.

Since this dataset is not published in a separate paper, I will reference it as follows:
> Guan, J., Li, R., Yu, S., & Zhang, X. (2023). Generation of Synthetic Electronic Medical Record Text. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that I include the citation format as described.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
