To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-scale Traffic Signal Control Using a Novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Xiaoqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is tested on various traffic flow scenarios, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. I will look for specific names of datasets or simulators that are utilized in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using a **TSC simulator** based on OpenAI-gym and a more realistic TSC simulator based on SUMO. 

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these simulators or datasets. The authors may not provide traditional datasets but rather describe the simulation environments they used for their experiments.

1. **TSC Simulator**: The paper describes a grid TSC system based on OpenAI-gym, which is used for testing the proposed method. The citation for OpenAI-gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **SUMO Simulator**: The authors also mention using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) for a more realistic TSC simulator. The citation for SUMO is:
   > Codeca, L., & Harri, J. (2018). Monaco SUMO Traffic (MOST) Scenario: A 3D Mobility Scenario for Cooperative ITS. In SUMO 2018, SUMO User Conference, Simulating Autonomous and Intermodal Transport Systems.

After identifying these datasets/simulators, I will ensure to document their descriptions and citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation.
