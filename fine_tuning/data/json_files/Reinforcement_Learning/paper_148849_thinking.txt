To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Scalable Routing with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for MANETs" by Saeed Kaviani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. I will look for specific phrases that indicate the presence of datasets, such as "we used," "the dataset includes," or "data was collected from."

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will note those down.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely contain comprehensive information about each dataset, including its purpose, structure, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will locate the original citation for that dataset in the references. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions.
3. Check for a dedicated datasets section for comprehensive information.
4. Consult the references section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information systematically for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
