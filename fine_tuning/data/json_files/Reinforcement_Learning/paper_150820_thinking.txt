To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust and Efficient Communications for Urban Air Mobility" by Dennis Becker and Lukas Schalk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets or measurement campaigns. The abstract mentions the development of a communication system called DroneCAST and discusses the evaluation of hardware prototypes, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the performance of these prototypes.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Development of a Drone-to-Drone Channel Model for Urban Environments based on Measurements)**, where the authors describe a measurement campaign conducted in 2019. This section provides specific details about the measurements taken, including the use of two small hexacopters to measure drone-to-drone (D2D) propagation characteristics in an urban environment. This indicates that there is a dataset related to these measurements.

In this section, the authors describe the measurement setup, including the frequency used (5.2 GHz) and the bandwidth (100 MHz), as well as the conditions under which the measurements were taken. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check **section 7 (Experimental Platform and Flight Demonstrations towards DroneCAST)**, where the authors discuss various flight missions and the performance of the experimental radio setup. This section may contain additional datasets related to the flight trials and the results obtained from different missions.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or measurement campaigns mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets.

For example, the measurement campaign mentioned in section 5 can be cited as follows:
- Becker, D., & Schalk, L. (2019). "Enabling Air-to-Air Wideband Channel Measurements between Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Optical Fibers." In 2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC), San Diego, CA, USA: IEEE, pp. 1â€“7.

Additionally, I will look for any other relevant citations that may pertain to the datasets used in the experiments or the development of the DroneCAST system.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
