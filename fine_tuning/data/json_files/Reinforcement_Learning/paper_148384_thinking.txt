To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Learning of Text Adventure Games with Sentence-Level Semantics" by Xusen Yin and Jonathan May, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a model in the context of zero-shot text-based adventure game learning, which suggests that datasets related to text adventure games may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4**, the authors mention using games released by Microsoft for the "First TextWorld Problems" competition, which provides a significant clue about the datasets used.

In **Section 4.1 (Game Settings)**, the authors specify that they used **4,440 cooking games generated by the TextWorld framework**. This is a clear dataset that I need to document. The section also describes how these games are categorized and the structure of the dataset, which is essential for understanding its scope.

Additionally, in **Section 4.2 (Out-of-genre Games)**, the authors mention generating **208 games in a different genre (treasure hunting)** using the TextWorld framework. This indicates another dataset that should be included.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For the **TextWorld framework**, the citation is:
  > Marc-Alexandre Cˆot´e, ´Akos K´ad´ar, Xingdi Yuan, Ben Kybartas, Tavian Barnes, Emery Fine, James Moore, Matthew J. Hausknecht, Layla El Asri, Mahmoud Adada, Wendy Tay, and Adam Trischler. *Textworld: A learning environment for text-based games*. CoRR, abs/1806.11532, 2018.

- For the **First TextWorld Problems competition**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft Research. *TextWorld: A learning environment for text-based games*. Available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/textworld.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cooking Games Dataset**: 4,440 cooking games generated by the TextWorld framework, used for training and evaluation.
2. **Treasure Hunting Games Dataset**: 208 games generated in a different genre (treasure hunting) using the TextWorld framework, used for testing the model's transferability.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
