To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Backprop: Online Alternating Minimization with Auxiliary Variables" by Anna Choromanska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "promising empirical results on a variety of architectures and datasets," which suggests that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

3. **HIGGS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,500,000 training samples with 28 features each, used for classifying whether a process produces a Higgs boson or not.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html, 2009.

- For the **HIGGS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The HIGGS dataset is described in: Baldi, P., et al. *The Higgs boson discovery at the LHC: A machine learning perspective*. arXiv:1402.4735, 2014.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
