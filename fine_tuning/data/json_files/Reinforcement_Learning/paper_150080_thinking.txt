To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Relevant is Selective Memory Population in Lifelong Language Learning?" by Vladimir Araujo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with text classification and question-answering tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Text Classification Datasets**: The authors state they used five datasets from Zhang et al. (2015):
   - **AGNews classification**
   - **Yelp sentiment analysis**
   - **Amazon sentiment analysis**
   - **DBPedia article classification**
   - **Yahoo questions and answers categorization**

   They also provide details about the total number of training and test examples across these datasets.

2. **Question Answering Datasets**: The authors specify three datasets:
   - **SQuAD 1.1** (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
   - **QuAC** (Choi et al., 2018)
   - **TriviaQA** (Joshi et al., 2017), which includes two sections: Web and Wikipedia.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct full citations for each:

- For **AGNews classification**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **Yelp sentiment analysis**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **Amazon sentiment analysis**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **DBPedia article classification**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **Yahoo questions and answers categorization**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **SQuAD 1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

- For **QuAC**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wentau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *QuAC: Question answering in context*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2174–2184, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

- For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:
  > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
