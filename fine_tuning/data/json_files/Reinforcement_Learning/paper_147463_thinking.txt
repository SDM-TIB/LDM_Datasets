To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving width-based planning with compact policies" by Miquel Junyent et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in "a subset of the Atari games suite," which suggests that there may be datasets related to Atari games.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using "the Atari benchmark" and refer to specific games such as "Pong," "Freeway," "Qbert," and "Breakout." This indicates that these games are part of the datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several works that may provide context or details about the datasets used, particularly in the context of Atari games.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Atari 2600 Games Dataset**: This dataset is implied through the mention of various Atari games used for evaluation. The authors state that they tested their approach on "four Atari 2600 games," which indicates that the dataset consists of game environments and associated data for these games.

2. **BASIC Features Dataset**: The authors mention using a set of BASIC features for their experiments, which are derived from the Atari game states. This suggests that there is a dataset related to the features extracted from the game states.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **Atari 2600 Games Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

- For the **BASIC Features Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the features, it references the work by Bellemare et al. (2013) as the foundational work for the Atari environment, which includes the features used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
