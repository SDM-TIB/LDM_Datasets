To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prolog Technology Reinforcement Learning Prover" by Zsolt Zombori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the toolkit is evaluated on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section (Section 3)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **M2k dataset**: This dataset is described as a selection of 2003 problems from the larger Mizar40 dataset, which consists of 32,524 problems from the Mizar Mathematical Library. The authors note that this dataset is biased towards saturation-style ATP systems.

2. **MPTP2078 benchmark**: This benchmark contains a selection of Mizar problems, specifically focusing on bushy (small) problems, regardless of their solvability by a particular ATP system.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **M2k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaliszyk, C., Urban, J. (2018). M2K dataset. Retrieved from https://github.com/JUrban/deepmath/blob/master/M2k_list

- For the **Mizar40 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaliszyk, C., Urban, J. (2018). Mizar40 dataset. Retrieved from https://github.com/JUrban/deepmath

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
