To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Easy as ABCs: Unifying Boltzmann Q-Learning and Counterfactual Regret Minimization" by Luca Dâ€™Amico-Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their method across environments drawn from the **OpenSpiel game library** and **OpenAI Gym**, indicating that these may be the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the specific environments they tested. They mention using environments such as **Cartpole**, **Kuhn Poker**, and **Leduc Poker**. These are likely the datasets or environments they utilized for their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about their evaluations on these environments, confirming that they are indeed the datasets used for testing their algorithm.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **OpenSpiel**: The citation for OpenSpiel is:
   > Lanctot, M., Waugh, K., Zinkevich, M., and Bowling, M. *Monte Carlo Sampling for Regret Minimization in Extensive Games*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 22. Curran Associates, Inc., 2009.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant datasets are documented with their proper citations.
