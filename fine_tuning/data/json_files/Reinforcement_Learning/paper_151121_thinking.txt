To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Multi-agent Learning framework for Information Gathering with Local Gaussian Processes for Water Monitoring" by Samuel Yanes Luis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a multi-agent system for monitoring water quality, which suggests that there may be datasets related to water quality measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks used in their research. The introduction highlights the monitoring of Ypacaraí Lake, which indicates that there may be datasets related to this specific location.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing the proposed models. The authors may describe the types of data collected, such as physicochemical parameters (e.g., pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen) and their sources.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors present any performance metrics based on specific datasets. This could provide additional context about the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to water quality monitoring in Ypacaraí Lake, I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset. If they reference a specific dataset used in their experiments, I will ensure to capture the full citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets related to water quality monitoring and their sources.
3. Consult the references section for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
