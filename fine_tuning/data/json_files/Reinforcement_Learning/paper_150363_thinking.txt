To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RIS-Assisted Jamming Rejection and Path Planning for UAV-Borne IoT Platform: A New Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework" by Shuyan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or simulations. This is where the authors are likely to detail the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to UAV trajectory planning, jamming rejection, or any other relevant IoT applications mentioned in the text. If specific datasets are not named, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as per the requirements.
