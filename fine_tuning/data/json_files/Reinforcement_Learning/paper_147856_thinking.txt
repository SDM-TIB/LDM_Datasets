To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Deep Q-Learning for Optimal Execution" by Brian Ning et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses applying the model to nine different stocks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these stocks.

Next, I will focus on the **results section** (Section 7), where the authors describe their experiments. They mention testing their approach on data using all trading days from **2-January-2017 to 30-March-2018** for various stocks, including **Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), NetApp Inc. (NTAP), Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), and Vodafone (VOD)**. This indicates that the dataset consists of historical trading data for these stocks.

I will also check the **data section (Section 7.1)** for more details about the dataset. Here, the authors confirm that they used the full limit order book information to extract the midprice at the end of each second and that they excluded the most volatile times of the day. This provides additional context about the nature of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets and their citations. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, I will create a general citation based on the information provided in the paper. The datasets can be cited as follows:

1. **Stock Trading Data**: This dataset includes historical trading data for the following stocks:
   - Apple (AAPL)
   - Amazon (AMZN)
   - Facebook (FB)
   - Google (GOOG)
   - Intel (INTC)
   - Microsoft (MSFT)
   - NetApp Inc. (NTAP)
   - Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)
   - Vodafone (VOD)

   The dataset spans from **2-January-2017 to 30-March-2018** and includes full limit order book information.

   Citation:
   > Ning, B., Lin, F. H. T., & Jaimungal, S. (2023). *Double Deep Q-Learning for Optimal Execution*. [Preprint]. Available at: [insert link if available].

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
