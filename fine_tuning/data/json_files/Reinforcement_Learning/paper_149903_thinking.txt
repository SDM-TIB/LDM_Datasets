To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Car Parking using Reinforcement Learning" by Omar Tanner, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. If a specific section on datasets is not present, I will search for mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or results.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for training the reinforcement learning models, as well as any benchmarks or environments that may have been utilized. I will also look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset. This may involve checking the **references section** of the paper to find the original sources of the datasets mentioned. It is crucial to provide accurate citations to give proper credit to the original dataset creators.

For example, if I find that the paper uses a dataset like the "SUMO" traffic simulation, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Krajzewicz, Daniel, et al. "SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility); an open-source traffic simulation." 2002.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.
