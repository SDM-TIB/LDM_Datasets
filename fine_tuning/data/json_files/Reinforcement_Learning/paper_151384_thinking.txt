To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LTL-Constrained Policy Optimization with Cycle Experience Replay" by Ameesh Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the experimental setup, as they typically contain detailed information about the datasets used. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for descriptions of the environments used for testing the proposed methods. The paper mentions three environments: **FlatWorld**, **ZonesEnv**, and **ButtonsEnv**. I will note down these environments as they are likely to be associated with specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets or environments, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the environments mentioned:
1. **FlatWorld**: I will check if there is a specific citation or reference associated with this environment.
2. **ZonesEnv**: This environment is based on the MuJoCo-based Safety-Gymnasium suite, so I will look for the original source or paper that describes it.
3. **ButtonsEnv**: Similar to ZonesEnv, I will find the reference that details this environment.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for further processing or review.
