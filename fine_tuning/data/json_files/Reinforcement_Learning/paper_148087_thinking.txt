To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Networked Control of Nonlinear Systems under Partial Observation Using Continuous Deep Q-Learning" by Junya Ikemoto and Toshimitsu Ushio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the simulations or experiments conducted. This section is crucial as it often contains details about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention applying their proposed controller to stabilize a **Chua circuit**. While they do not explicitly refer to a dataset in the traditional sense, the Chua circuit's dynamics and parameters can be considered as the data used for their simulations. I will note the specifics of the Chua circuit as it is central to their experiments.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks in the **references section**. This is important for providing full citations for any datasets or models that are referenced in the paper.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information regarding the Chua circuit and any other relevant datasets or models mentioned. The citation for the Chua circuit dynamics is not provided in the paper, so I will note that it is a well-known system in control theory.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for any referenced works that relate to datasets or models used in the experiments. If the authors refer to any specific datasets from previous studies, I will extract those citations as well.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focusing on the experiments section for details on the Chua circuit and any datasets.
3. Checking the references for citations related to datasets or models.
4. Compiling the information and ensuring proper citations for any datasets mentioned.

By following these steps, I will be able to accurately extract and cite the datasets relevant to the research presented in this paper.
