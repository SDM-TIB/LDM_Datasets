To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Hearthstone AI by Combining MCTS and Supervised Learning Algorithms" by Maciej Świechowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of supervised prediction models and mentions experiments designed to evaluate the Hearthstone agent's decision-making, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section**. Here, the authors reference the HearthSim project, which aggregates user data such as game results and deck compositions. This indicates that there may be datasets related to Hearthstone games that could be relevant.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the data used for training their models. They mention creating a dataset with over 3.5 million samples from games played by strong MCTS bots. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **conclusions section** for any additional mentions of datasets or data sources that may have been used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **HearthSim Project Data**: This dataset includes aggregated user data such as game results, deck compositions, and card usage statistics. It is a community-driven dataset that supports AI and machine learning experiments in Hearthstone.

2. **Custom Dataset from MCTS Games**: The authors created a dataset with over 3.5 million samples from games played by strong MCTS bots using 400 different decks. This dataset is crucial for training their value network and evaluating game outcomes.

Next, I will look for full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. The HearthSim project is likely referenced in the related work, and I will extract the citation from there. For the custom dataset, since it is generated by the authors, I will note it as part of their research contributions.

The citations I will include are:

- For the **HearthSim Project**:
  > HearthSim project. Available at: https://hearthsim.info/

- For the **Custom Dataset**:
  > Świechowski, M., Tajmajer, T., & Janusz, A. (2018). Improving Hearthstone AI by Combining MCTS and Supervised Learning Algorithms. In Proceedings of the CIG (Computational Intelligence in Games) conference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have clearly documented each dataset, including its purpose and the context in which it was used in the research. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the study.
