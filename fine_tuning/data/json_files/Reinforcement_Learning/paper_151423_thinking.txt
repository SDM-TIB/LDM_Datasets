To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Age of Information Minimization using Multi-agent UAVs based on AI-Enhanced Mean Field Resource Allocation" by Yousef Emami et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and results, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions. This section may provide insights into the sources of the datasets, their formats, and any preprocessing steps taken by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized, I will also note their common citations, as these may be referenced in multiple works.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
