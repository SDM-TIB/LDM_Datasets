To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generalizable Representations for Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Meta-Learner of Behavioral Similarities" by Jianda Chen and Sinno Jialin Pan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on several benchmarks, including the **DeepMind Control Suite** and the **CARLA** simulator. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits or configurations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. They specifically mention:
1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This suite provides high-dimensional pixel observations for reinforcement learning tasks. The authors refer to it as a benchmark for their experiments.
2. **CARLA**: An autonomous driving simulator that offers a realistic environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., & Riedmiller, M. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. CoRR, abs/1801.00690.

For **CARLA**, the citation is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1â€“16.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
