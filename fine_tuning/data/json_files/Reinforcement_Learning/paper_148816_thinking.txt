To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPAC: Opportunistic Actor-Critic" by Srinjoy Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 8), as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they have selected six environments for their experiments: **Ant-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Humanoid-v2, InvertedPendulum-v2, and Walker2d-v2**. These environments are part of the MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references the MuJoCo physics engine, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. The relevant citation for MuJoCo is:

- For **MuJoCo**:
  > Todorov, E.; Erez, T.; and Tassa, Y. 2012. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 5026–5033.

Additionally, I will note that the environments (Ant-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, etc.) are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, which is also referenced in the paper. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G.; Cheung, V.; Pettersson, L.; Schneider, J.; Schulman, J.; Tang, J.; and Zaremba, W. 2016. *OpenAI Gym*.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Ant-v2**: A continuous control environment from the MuJoCo physics engine.
2. **HalfCheetah-v2**: Another continuous control environment from MuJoCo.
3. **Hopper-v2**: A continuous control environment from MuJoCo.
4. **Humanoid-v2**: A more complex continuous control environment from MuJoCo.
5. **InvertedPendulum-v2**: A simpler continuous control environment from MuJoCo.
6. **Walker2d-v2**: A continuous control environment from MuJoCo.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- For **MuJoCo**:
  > Todorov, E.; Erez, T.; and Tassa, Y. 2012. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 5026–5033.

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G.; Cheung, V.; Pettersson, L.; Schneider, J.; Schulman, J.; Tang, J.; and Zaremba, W. 2016. *OpenAI Gym*.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
