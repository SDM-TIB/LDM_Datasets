To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Aided Packet-Routing For Aeronautical Ad-Hoc Networks Formed by Passenger Planes" by Dong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their simulations or evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they generated **synthetic flight data** to mimic airplane mobility for their simulations. This indicates that the dataset is not a standard dataset but rather one created specifically for this study.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of snapshots generated, the parameters used for creating the synthetic data, and any relevant characteristics that define the dataset. The authors state that they generated **2000 snapshots of the network**, with half used for training and the other half for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to check if there are any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is synthetic and created by the authors, there may not be an external citation. Instead, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Synthetic Flight Data**: This dataset consists of 2000 snapshots of airplane positions generated to simulate the mobility of aircraft in an aeronautical ad-hoc network. The data reflects typical flight paths and includes variations to mimic real-world conditions.

Since this dataset is unique to the study and does not have an external citation, I will note that it is derived from the authors' own simulations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation of the paper itself for reference:

- **Citation for the paper**:
  > Dong Liu, Jingjing Cui, Jiankang Zhang, Chenyang Yang, and Lajos Hanzo. *Deep Reinforcement Learning Aided Packet-Routing For Aeronautical Ad-Hoc Networks Formed by Passenger Planes*. 

With this information, I will be ready to create the dataset entries as required.
