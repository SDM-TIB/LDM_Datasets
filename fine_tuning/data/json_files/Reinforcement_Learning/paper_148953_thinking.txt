To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Explanation using Attention Mechanism in Actor-Critic-based Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Hidenori Itaya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments using the **Atari 2600 games** as their primary datasets. They mention several specific games, which serve as the datasets for their reinforcement learning experiments. The games mentioned include:

1. **Ms. Pac-Man**: A classic arcade game where the player controls Pac-Man to collect cookies while avoiding enemies.
2. **Space Invaders**: A shooting game where the player repels enemy invaders.
3. **Seaquest**: A game where players use submarines to rescue divers and destroy enemies.
4. **Breakout**: A game where the player hits a ball back with a paddle to break bricks.
5. **Beamrider**: A game where the player navigates a spaceship and avoids obstacles while shooting enemies.
6. **Fishing Derby**: A game where players catch fish to score points.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that may have been referenced. However, since the datasets in this case are well-known games, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

For the Atari 2600 games, I can refer to the following citation for the OpenAI Gym, which provides these environments:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as it encompasses the Atari 2600 environments used in the experiments.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper as the Atari 2600 games, and I will document them along with the relevant citation for OpenAI Gym.
