The state space is continuous, represented as a quadruple (cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity at tip), while the action space is discrete (push cart to the left or right). The goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, receiving a reward of +1 for each timestep the pole remains upright.",
