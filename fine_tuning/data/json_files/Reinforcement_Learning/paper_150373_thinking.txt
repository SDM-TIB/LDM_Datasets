To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Offline Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Treatment Optimization Applications" by Mila Nambiar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors performed extensive experiments on two real-world tasks for diabetes and sepsis treatment optimization, indicating that datasets related to these tasks are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly **section 5.1 (Treatment optimization applications)**, where the authors describe the specific applications they studied. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Singapore Diabetes Registry**: This dataset is used for the diabetes treatment recommendation task. The authors specify that it includes electronic medical records from outpatient prescription visits for type 2 diabetes patients, detailing the patient medical profile and treatment history.

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the sepsis treatment recommendation task. The authors indicate that it contains data on a cohort of sepsis patients, including various medical profile variables.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Singapore Diabetes Registry**, the citation is:
  > Lim, D. Y. Z., Chia, S. Y., Kadir, H. A., Mohamed Salim, N. N., & Bee, Y. M. (2021). Establishment of the SingHealth Diabetes Registry. *Clinical Epidemiology*, 13, 215â€“223. https://doi.org/10.2147/CLEP.S300663.

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, Article 160035. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.35.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Singapore Diabetes Registry** - Citation: Lim et al. (2021).
2. **MIMIC-III Dataset** - Citation: Johnson et al. (2016).

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their full citations for future reference or analysis.
