To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Explainable Knowledge Tracing" by Yanhong Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **ASSISTment2009 dataset** to evaluate their methods. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then check the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset, such as its size, characteristics, and how it was used in the experiments. The authors may provide insights into the dataset's relevance to their research.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the ASSISTment2009 dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the ASSISTment2009 dataset is as follows:
> Heffernan, N. T., & Heffernan, C. L. (2014). *ASSISTments 2009: A dataset for educational data mining*. In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2014).

Now that I have the dataset name and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying specific sections that discuss datasets.
3. Extracting details about the ASSISTment2009 dataset from the experiments section.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
