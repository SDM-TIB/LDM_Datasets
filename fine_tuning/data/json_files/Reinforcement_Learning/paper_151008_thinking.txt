To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Sensitivity in Quantitative Trade and Spatial Models" by Bas Sanders, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **mirror trade dataset** from Linsi, Burgoon, and Mügge (2023) and the **distance dataset** from Mayer and Zignago (2011). This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant mentions in the **methodology** or **application** sections. In section 4.2, the author explicitly states that the **mirror trade dataset** collects reported bilateral trade flows by both exporters and importers, which is interpreted as two noisy measures of the true bilateral trade flow. This confirms its significance in the analysis.

In section 4.1, the author also mentions the **distance dataset** used for estimating parameters related to trade flows. This dataset is essential for the calibration of the model discussed in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Mirror Trade Dataset**:
   - Citation: Linsi, L., Burgoon, B., & Mügge, D. K. (2023). *The Problem with Trade Measurement in International Relations*. International Studies Quarterly, 67, sqad020.

2. **Distance Dataset**:
   - Citation: Mayer, T., & Zignago, S. (2011). *Notes on CEPII’s distances measures: The GeoDist database*.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset's relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
