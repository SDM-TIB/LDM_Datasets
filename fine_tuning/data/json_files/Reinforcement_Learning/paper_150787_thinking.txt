To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A reinforcement learning based construction material supply strategy using robotic crane and computer vision for building reconstruction after an earthquake" by Yifei Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the training and evaluation of the reinforcement learning models. This section may contain details about the datasets used for training the models, including any simulation environments or real-world data that were utilized.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were used to validate the models or to compare performance. This may include descriptions of the scenarios or environments in which the models were tested.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any specific datasets mentioned, such as simulation environments or benchmark datasets, and their corresponding citations. If the authors refer to any datasets that are not well-known, I will ensure to find the original sources or papers that describe those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for further processing or review.
