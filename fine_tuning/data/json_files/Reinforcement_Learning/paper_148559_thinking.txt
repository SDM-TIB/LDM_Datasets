To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulating multi-exit evacuation using deep reinforcement learning" by Dong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a novel simulation method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the simulation environment and the data used for training the model. I will look for any references to datasets or data sources that were utilized in the experiments.

As I read through the **methodology overview** and **deep reinforcement learning** sections, I will pay attention to any mention of specific datasets or data generation methods. If the authors describe how they generated or collected data for their simulations, I will note that down as it may be relevant.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check there as well to see if the authors reference any datasets used for validation or comparison purposes. This could provide additional context or specific dataset names.

Once I have identified any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution.

If the authors refer to any datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized, I will also look for their original papers or sources to provide accurate citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
