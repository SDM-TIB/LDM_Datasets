To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConQUR: Mitigating Delusional Bias in Deep Q-learning" by Andy Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of experimental results on the **Atari games**, which indicates that there might be datasets related to these games. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will specifically check for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Atari test suite** as the primary dataset for their experiments. This is a significant dataset in the context of reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **background** and **related work** sections for any additional datasets that might be referenced. However, the focus seems to remain on the Atari games throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari dataset. The Atari dataset is often associated with the following citation:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the Atari Learning Environment.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Check the references for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Compile the information for clarity and completeness.
