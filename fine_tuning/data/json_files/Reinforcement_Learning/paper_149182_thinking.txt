To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expert Q-learning: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Coarse State Values from Offline Expert Examples" by Li Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the board game Othello for experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets related to game states or expert examples.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe how they represent positions of board games and the sources of expert examples. They mention that the positions are represented by binary values in two channels, indicating that the dataset consists of game states from Othello.

In the **methods section**, the authors detail how they sample expert examples from various player types (RANDOM, GREEDY, STOCHASTIC) during their experiments. This indicates that the dataset includes gameplay data from these different player strategies.

Now, I will look for any specific references to datasets or data sources in the **references section**. The paper does not explicitly cite a formal dataset but mentions the use of expert examples derived from gameplay against different opponents. 

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will note the relevant information about the dataset derived from the gameplay:

1. **Othello Game States**: The dataset consists of binary representations of Othello board positions, with each position represented by two channels (one for each player). The dataset is generated from gameplay against various opponents, including RANDOM, GREEDY, and STOCHASTIC players.

2. **Expert Examples**: The expert examples are derived from the gameplay of the STOCHASTIC player against the RANDOM, GREEDY, and STOCHASTIC players, providing a set of labeled states indicating whether a state is good, neutral, or bad.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Othello Game States**: No formal citation, but the dataset is based on gameplay data from the Othello game, represented in binary format.

- **Expert Examples**: No formal citation, but the expert examples are derived from gameplay against various opponents in the Othello game.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
