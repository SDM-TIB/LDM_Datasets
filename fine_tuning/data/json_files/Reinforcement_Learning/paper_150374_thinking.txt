To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Optimal Compression: Joint Pruning and Quantization" by Ben Zandonati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for model compression and mention that their method was evaluated on several datasets, including **MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, SST-2, MNLI-m, SQuAD, and COCO**. This gives me a list of datasets to focus on.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in their evaluations. The authors explicitly mention using the following datasets for their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification with millions of images across thousands of categories.
4. **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset derived from movie reviews.
5. **MNLI-m**: A dataset for natural language inference.
6. **SQuAD**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions based on a set of Wikipedia articles.
7. **COCO**: A dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631–1642, Seattle, Washington, USA, October 2013. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MNLI-m**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. 2018.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. 2016.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
