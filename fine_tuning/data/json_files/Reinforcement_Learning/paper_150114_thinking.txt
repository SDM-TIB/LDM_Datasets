To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable fMRI-based Brain Decoding via Spatial Temporal-pyramid Graph Convolutional Network" by Ziyuan Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors describe their methodology and datasets in detail. Here, they explicitly state that they utilized minimally preprocessed resting-state fMRI and task-evoked fMRI data from the HCP S1200 Release 1 dataset. This confirms the dataset's relevance and importance to their study.

In Section III.A, the authors provide additional context about the HCP S1200 dataset, mentioning that it contains data from 1200 subjects who performed 23 tasks across 7 categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the HCP S1200 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Van Essen, D. C., Smith, S. M., Barch, D. M., Behrens, T. E., Yacoub, E., Ugurbil, K., & W.-M. H. Consortium. (2013). The Wu-Minn Human Connectome Project: An overview. *NeuroImage*, 80, 62-79.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **HCP S1200 Dataset**: This dataset includes minimally preprocessed resting-state fMRI and task-evoked fMRI data from 1200 subjects, who performed 23 cognitive tasks across 7 categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.
