To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Gradient Descent: A Powerful and Principled Evasion Attack Against Neural Networks" by Weiran Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on **CIFAR10** and **ImageNet**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that they evaluated their attacks against adversarially trained models on **CIFAR10** and **ImageNet**, which reinforces the earlier findings.

I will also look for any specific details about these datasets in the **background or evaluation setup sections**. The paper states that **CIFAR10** consists of 10,000 images and **ImageNet** has 50,000 images, providing context about their sizes and usage.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. [Link to dataset](http://www.image-net.org/).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring to include their full citations for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets effectively.
