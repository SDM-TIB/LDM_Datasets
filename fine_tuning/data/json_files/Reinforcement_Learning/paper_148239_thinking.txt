To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Policy Optimization" by Xiaobai Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction might provide context or mention datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention testing their method on various environments, specifically:

1. **Classic Control Tasks**: The paper lists three tasks: Acrobot, Mountain Car, and Bipedal Walker. Each of these tasks is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning.

2. **Roboschool Robotics Tasks**: The authors mention three robotics environments: Ant, HalfCheetah, and Hopper. These are also established benchmarks in the field.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or the papers that introduced them. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the experiments section are as follows:

- For **Acrobot**, the citation is:
  > Geramifard, A., Dann, C., Klein, R. H., Dabney, W., & How, J. P. (2015). RLPy: A value-function-based reinforcement learning framework for education and research. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 16, 1573–1578.

- For **Mountain Car**, the citation is:
  > Moore, A. W. (1991). Efficient Memory-based Learning for Robot Control. PhD thesis, Carnegie Mellon University.

- For **Bipedal Walker**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Ant**, the citation is:
  > Schulman, J., Wolski, F., Dhariwal, P., Radford, A., & Klimov, O. (2017). Proximal policy optimization algorithms. arXiv:1707.06347.

- For **HalfCheetah**, the citation is:
  > Wawrzynski, P. (2007). Learning to control a 6-degree-of-freedom walking robot. In *EUROCON 2007-The International Conference on “Computer as a Tool”*, pages 698–705. IEEE.

- For **Hopper**, the citation is:
  > Murthy, S. S., & Raibert, M. H. (1984). 3D balance in legged locomotion: Modeling and simulation for the one-legged case. *ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics*, 18(1), 27–27.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
