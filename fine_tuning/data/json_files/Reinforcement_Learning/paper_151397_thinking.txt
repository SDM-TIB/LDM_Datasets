To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEVD: Synthetic Event-based Vision Dataset for Ego and Fixed Traffic Perception" by Manideep Reddy Aliminati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract introduces the SEVD dataset as a novel contribution, which indicates that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the SEVD dataset in detail, including its features, data types, and the conditions under which it was recorded. 

In the **datasets section**, I will note the following key points about the SEVD dataset:
- It is a multi-view synthetic event-based dataset designed for ego and fixed perception.
- It includes various sensor data types such as RGB imagery, depth maps, optical flow, semantic, and instance segmentation.
- The dataset spans diverse environmental conditions, including different lighting and weather scenarios.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the SEVD dataset was used for evaluation and to understand its application in the context of the experiments conducted.

Next, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The SEVD dataset is the primary focus, but the authors also reference other datasets in the context of their work. I will ensure to extract the full citations for these datasets as well.

The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **SEVD Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for further research or analysis.
