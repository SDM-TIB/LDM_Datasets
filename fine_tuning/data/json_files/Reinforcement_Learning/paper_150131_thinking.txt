To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multilevel Reinforcement Learning Framework for PDE-based Control" by Atish Dixit and Ahmed H. Elsheikh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe two environments, **ResSim-v1** and **ResSim-v2**, which are used for demonstrating the proposed multilevel PPO algorithm. I will extract the relevant details about these environments, including their parameters and characteristics.

For **ResSim-v1**, the authors provide specific details about the simulation setup, including the number of injection and outlet locations, the total injection rate, and the distribution of permeability. I will summarize these details to create a clear description of the dataset.

For **ResSim-v2**, similar details are provided, including the number of outlets and injections, the total injection rate, and the modeling of permeability as a constrained log-normal distribution. I will also summarize these details for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **ResSim-v1**:
   > Brouwer, D. R., Jansen, J. D., Van der Starre, S., Van Kruijsdijk, C. P. J. W., & Berentsen, C. W. J. (2001). Recovery increase through water flooding with smart well technology. In *SPE European Formation Damage Conference*. Society of Petroleum Engineers.

2. **ResSim-v2**:
   > Christie, A. M., Blunt, M. J., et al. (2001). Tenth SPE comparative solution project: A comparison of upscaling techniques. In *SPE Reservoir Simulation Symposium*. Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
