To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Q-Learning for Citizen Relocation During Natural Hazards" by Alysson Ribeiro da Silva, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of a hazard simulation engine based on a grid world, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the author describes the hazard simulation engine. Here, I will look for any specific datasets or simulation parameters that are used to create the grid world or to simulate different types of hazards. The paper mentions five types of flooding simulations, but it does not explicitly name any datasets. 

In the **experimental design section**, the author describes the generation of maps for testing the Double Q-Learning method. It states that 20 maps with fewer obstacles and 10 maps with plenty of obstacles were generated for grid sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense, but rather experimental setups.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will check the **References section** for any studies or datasets that may have been used indirectly. The references include various studies related to natural hazards, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were utilized in the experiments.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets cited or described in the context of this research. The author primarily discusses a simulation engine and the experimental setup without referencing external datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the creation of a hazard simulation engine and the generation of test maps, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
