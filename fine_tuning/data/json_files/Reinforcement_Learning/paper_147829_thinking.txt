To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Complexity of Exploration in Goal-Driven Navigation" by Maruan Al-Shedivat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of **EscapeRoom environments**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for measuring exploration complexity in environments with multiple dependent subgoals. They introduce the concept of **EscapeRooms**, which indicates that these environments are central to their research. I will look for any specific datasets or references to data used in these environments.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection titled **EscapeRoom environments**, the authors describe the procedural generation of these environments. They mention that the environments are based on **Gym MiniGrid** and follow the **OpenAI Gym API**. This suggests that the environments themselves may be part of a dataset or framework that can be referenced.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention training various algorithms on the EscapeRoom environments, but I need to confirm if they provide specific dataset citations.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the relevant datasets and their full citations. The key dataset identified is the **EscapeRoom environments**, which are procedurally generated and based on the Gym MiniGrid framework. The citation for this framework is:

- For **Gym MiniGrid**:
  > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or external datasets used for evaluation, I will focus on documenting the EscapeRoom environments as the primary dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
