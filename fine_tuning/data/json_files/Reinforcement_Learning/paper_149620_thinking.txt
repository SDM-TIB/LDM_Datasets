To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary Construction of Perfectly Balanced Boolean Functions" by Luca Mariot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of Genetic Programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to construct Boolean functions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the **methodology** section, I find that the authors describe their approach to constructing Weightwise Perfectly Balanced (WPB) Boolean functions but do not specify any datasets. Instead, they focus on the algorithms and techniques employed.

I will then check the **related works** section, which might reference previous studies that utilized specific datasets. However, this section primarily discusses the evolution of Boolean functions and does not provide any dataset information.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to identify any datasets that might have been cited in the context of previous research. The references include various papers related to Boolean functions and cryptography, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments; instead, they focused on algorithmic approaches and theoretical constructs. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research.**
2. **The focus was primarily on the development of algorithms rather than empirical testing with datasets.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of a research paper to identify relevant datasets, even when they may not be immediately apparent.
