To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte-Carlo Tree Search as Regularized Policy Optimization" by Jean-Bastien Grill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which could include mentions of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. If the authors refer to specific benchmarks or datasets, I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **DeepMind Control Suite** for continuous control tasks and the **Atari benchmarks** for evaluating their algorithms. I will ensure to gather details about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant statistics provided in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, I will find the citation:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). *DeepMind control suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

For the **Atari benchmarks**, I will locate the citation:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
