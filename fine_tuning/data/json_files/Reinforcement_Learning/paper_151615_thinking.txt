To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning Optimizations for Auto-regressive Decoder of Multilingual ASR systems" by Chin Yuen Kwok et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using the **Common Voice dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention using a subset of the **Common Voice dataset** for their experiments, which consists of 10 languages pre-trained by Whisper and 10 new languages. Each language has a defined structure: a 10-hour training set, a 1-hour validation set, and a 1-hour test set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Common Voice dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **Common Voice dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Common Voice Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale multilingual speech corpus that includes various languages. The authors used a subset of this dataset for their experiments, specifically focusing on 10 pre-trained languages and 10 new languages, with defined training, validation, and test splits.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is crucial for proper attribution.
