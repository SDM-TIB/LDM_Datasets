To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining AI and AM â€” Improving Approximate Matching through Transformer Networks" by Frieder Uhlig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental protocol section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, the authors mention using multiple datasets for training and evaluation. Specifically, they refer to the **Govdocs corpus**, **SRILabs JavaScript corpus**, and **FUSE corpus** for training, and the **NapierOne corpus** for evaluation. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of samples and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I will look for are:

1. **Govdocs corpus**: I will find the original paper or source that describes this dataset.
2. **SRILabs JavaScript corpus**: I will locate the reference that details this corpus.
3. **FUSE corpus**: I will search for the citation that provides information about this dataset.
4. **NapierOne corpus**: I will also find the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
