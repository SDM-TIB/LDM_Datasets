To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Contention Window Design Using Deep Q-Learning" by Abhishek Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of numerical experiments based on the **NS3 simulator**, which suggests that there may be datasets or simulation parameters involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the simulations they conducted. Here, they mention using the **NS3 simulator** to model a wireless network, but they do not specify any external datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters of the simulation, such as the number of nodes and the protocol used (IEEE 802.11b), which are crucial for replicating their experiments but do not constitute traditional datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets that can be cited, I will note that the primary data used for the experiments comes from the simulation environment (NS3) rather than from publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are specified in the paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper utilizes simulation data from the NS3 simulator, it does not reference any external datasets that would require citation. This is an important distinction to make when documenting the datasets used in research papers.
