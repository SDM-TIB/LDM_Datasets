To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Few-Shot Acquisition Function Learning for Bayesian Optimization" by Bing-Jing Hsieh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "a wide variety of synthetic and real-world test functions," which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for these evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **HPOBench Dataset**: This dataset is used for hyperparameter optimization of the XGBoost algorithm. It consists of pre-computed results for various hyperparameter configurations across 48 classification datasets.

2. **Electrical Grid Stability Dataset**: This dataset records features related to the stability of electrical grids and contains 60,000 parameter configurations.

3. **Air Quality Prediction Dataset**: This dataset includes meteorological monitoring data collected in northern Taiwan, focusing on air quality features and PM2.5 levels.

4. **Oil Well Dataset**: This dataset contains information about oil wells, specifically the longitude and latitude of the surface and bottom of the wells, used to find the deepest drilled depth.

5. **Asteroid Dataset**: This dataset includes various features of asteroids, with the goal of predicting the maximum diameter based on these features.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly provided for datasets, but I will look for any relevant papers or sources that describe them.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **HPOBench Dataset**:

  > Victor Basu. Prediction of Asteroid Diameter with the help of Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
