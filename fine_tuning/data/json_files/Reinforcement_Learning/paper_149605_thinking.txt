To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulation-to-Reality domain adaptation for offline 3D object annotation on pointclouds with correlation alignment" by Weishuang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use simulated data from CARLA and real-world pointclouds, which suggests that these datasets are important for their study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention several large-scale LiDAR annotated datasets used in autonomous driving, including **KITTI**, **nuScenes**, **Waymo**, **Lyft**, and **Semantic-KITTI**. This is a good indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

In the **section 2.1 (Simulated & Real datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets they used. They describe a **simulated pointcloud dataset** generated with 16k multi-LiDAR scans, which includes classes for "Pedestrian" and "Car." They also mention a **real pointcloud dataset** consisting of 223 annotated scans collected from their target vehicle, which is crucial for their experiments.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
