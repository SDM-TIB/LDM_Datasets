To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Deep Markov Models with Applications in Automatic Trading" by Tadeu A. Ferreira, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used real data sets from the limit order book of Facebook, Intel, Vodafone, and Microsoft, which suggests that these datasets are important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, particularly **section 8 (Real Data Experiment)**, where the authors describe their methodology for using real stock prices from these companies. They mention extracting all order executions from the limit order book tick-by-tick data and sampling the mid-price every second. This section will likely provide more details about the datasets used.

In **section 8**, the authors specify the datasets used for training and testing:
1. **Facebook (FB)**: Data from January 2018 to March 2018.
2. **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Data from January 2018 to March 2018.
3. **Intel (INTC)**: Data from January 2018 to March 2018.
4. **Vodafone (VOD)**: Data from 2017.

The paper also mentions that the first 400,000 data points for INTC, MSFT, and FB were used for training, while the first 200,000 data points for VOD were used for training. The remaining data points were used for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from real-world stock market data, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the sources as follows:

- **Facebook (FB)**: Data sourced from the limit order book tick-by-tick data for Facebook, covering January 2018 to March 2018.
- **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Data sourced from the limit order book tick-by-tick data for Microsoft, covering January 2018 to March 2018.
- **Intel (INTC)**: Data sourced from the limit order book tick-by-tick data for Intel, covering January 2018 to March 2018.
- **Vodafone (VOD)**: Data sourced from the limit order book tick-by-tick data for Vodafone, covering the year 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
