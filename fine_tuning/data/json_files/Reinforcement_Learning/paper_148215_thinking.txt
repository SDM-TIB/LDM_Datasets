To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Dynamically Coordinate Multi-Robot Teams in Graph Attention Networks" by Zheyuan Wang and Matthew Gombolay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that for detailed descriptions.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. For instance, if the authors mention generating problems for testing their model, I will note the parameters they used, such as the number of tasks, robots, and constraints.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "Gurobi" for generating scheduling problems, I will look for the appropriate citation in the references. If they mention any other datasets or benchmarks, I will do the same.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
