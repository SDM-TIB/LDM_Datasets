To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainability and Adversarial Attacks for Trustworthy QA" by Rachneet Sachdeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of SQUARE v2, which provides an explainability infrastructure for QA models, but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the explosion of Question Answering datasets and models. However, they do not provide specific names of datasets here either. 

Moving on to the **methods and experiments sections**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments. In the **section 3 (UKP-SQUARE)**, the authors describe the platform but do not list any datasets. However, in **section 4 (Trustworthy Methods for QA)**, they mention the use of **ConceptNet** as a knowledge graph datastore for their QA-GNN model. This indicates that ConceptNet is a dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for ConceptNet. The citation is as follows:
> Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. *Conceptnet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, February 4-9, 2017, San Francisco, California, USA, pages 4444â€“4451. AAAI Press.

Since ConceptNet is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
