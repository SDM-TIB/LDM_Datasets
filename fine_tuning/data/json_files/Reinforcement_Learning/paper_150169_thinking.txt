To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Isometric Representations in Neural Networks Improve Robustness" by Kosio Beshkov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the robustness of neural networks and mentions training on MNIST, which suggests that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 2.2) where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training their models. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, primarily used for handwritten digit classification.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results** or **discussion sections**. In this case, the authors refer to a custom dataset they generated for their experiments involving "two topologically entangled rings." However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will note it as a custom dataset without a formal citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

For the custom dataset involving entangled rings, since it does not have a formal citation, I will note it as:
   > Custom dataset generated for the experiments in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
