To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Sensitivity and Robustness" by Timothy Christensen and Benjamin Connault, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a **Datasets** or **Data** section. If such a section exists, it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the datasets are not clearly outlined in a dedicated section, I will search for mentions of datasets throughout the paper, particularly in the **methodology** and **results** sections. These sections often describe the data used for analysis and may include references to specific datasets or data sources.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official title or commonly used name.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., numerical, categorical) and the context in which it was collected.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

I will also check the **References section** of the paper to find any citations related to the datasets. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citation information.

After compiling the information, I will summarize each dataset in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
