To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Control of District Cooling Energy Plant with Reinforcement Learning and MPC" by Zhong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the research is supported by data from the energy management system at the United World College (UWC) of South East Asia, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **system description** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of data for training the reinforcement learning controller, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for this purpose.

In the **system description** section, the authors describe the District Cooling Energy Plant (DCEP) and mention that they used data from the UWC campus for model calibration and validation. They specify that 80% of the data was used for model identification and 20% for verification. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the UWC campus energy management system.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the UWC dataset as follows:

- For the UWC dataset, the citation is:
  > Miller, C., Nagy, Z., and Schlueter, A. (2014). "A seed dataset for a public, temporal data repository for energy informatics research on commercial building performance." In Proceedings Of 3rd Conf. on Future Energy Business and Energy Informatics, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Additionally, the authors mention using electricity price data from PJM, which is another dataset that needs to be documented. The citation for this dataset is:

- For PJM data, the citation is:
  > PJM Interconnection. (2022). "Real-Time Hourly LMPs." Retrieved from https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/etools/data-miner-2.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

1. **UWC Campus Dataset**: This dataset is used for model calibration and validation of the DCEP.
   - Citation: Miller, C., Nagy, Z., and Schlueter, A. (2014). "A seed dataset for a public, temporal data repository for energy informatics research on commercial building performance." In Proceedings Of 3rd Conf. on Future Energy Business and Energy Informatics, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

2. **PJM Electricity Price Data**: This dataset provides real-time electricity prices used in the simulations.
   - Citation: PJM Interconnection. (2022). "Real-Time Hourly LMPs." Retrieved from https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/etools/data-miner-2.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
