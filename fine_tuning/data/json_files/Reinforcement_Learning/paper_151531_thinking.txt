To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAR: Skeleton-aware Text-based 4D Avatar Generation with In-Network Motion Retargeting" by Zenghao Chai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically outlines the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific characteristics or splits of the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional details about the datasets, such as their size, the types of data they contain, and how they were utilized in the experiments. This is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were applied.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. It is essential to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this is important for academic integrity and reproducibility.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "SMPL-X" model, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> G. Pavlakos, V. Choutas, N. Ghorbani, T. Bolkart, A. A. Osman, D. Tzionas, and M. J. Black. *Expressive body capture: 3D hands, face, and body from a single image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 10,975â€“10,985, 2019.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This step-by-step approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
