To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing PubMed User Query Logs for Post Hoc Explanations of Recommended Similar Articles" by Ashley Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a dataset called **PubCLogs**, which is derived from user query logs. This is a strong indication that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the dataset in detail. In this paper, the authors describe the construction of **PubCLogs** in **section 3 (Method)**, specifically in **subsection 3.1 (Building PubCLogs)**. Here, they explain how they collected user coclick data and filtered it to create the dataset.

The authors mention that the initial collection included **5.6 million pairs of coclicked articles**, which was filtered down to **1.5 million instances for the training set**, **47,000 for the development set**, and **47,000 for the test set**. This detailed description confirms that **PubCLogs** is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. However, since **PubCLogs** is a novel dataset created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note the authors' explanation of the dataset's construction and its significance in the context of their research.

The citation for the paper itself, which includes the dataset, is:
> Ashley Shin, Qiao Jin, James Anibal, and Zhiyong Lu. 2024. Harnessing PubMed User Query Logs for Post Hoc Explanations of Recommended Similar Articles. In Proceedings of (Preprint). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX

Since **PubCLogs** is derived from user query logs and is central to the paper's contributions, I will treat it as the dataset of interest.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is **PubCLogs**, and its citation is tied to the paper itself. I will compile this information for further processing or review.
