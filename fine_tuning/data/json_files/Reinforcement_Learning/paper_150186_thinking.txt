To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Microgrid Optimization Strategy Considering Priority Flexible Demand Side" by Jinsong Sang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for mentions of data sources or datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the context of their research and any datasets they reference. If they mention specific datasets or data sources, I will note them down.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or experiments. The authors may describe the characteristics of the datasets, such as their size, type, and source. For instance, they mention using "real wind energy production data of a wind farm" and "the data volume is real-time data of 240 days and 5760 h." This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to wind energy production.

Additionally, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparisons with other algorithms. This may provide further confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name or title of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, based on the information gathered, I might identify the following datasets:

1. **Wind Farm Data**: This dataset consists of real-time wind energy production data collected over 240 days, with a total of 5760 hours of data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Oy, F. Wind Farm Data, Finland, 2018.

2. **Microgrid Simulation Data**: If the paper mentions any specific datasets used for simulations or comparisons, I will document those as well, ensuring to provide full citations.

Finally, I will ensure that all the extracted datasets are clearly documented and formatted according to the requirements, ready for further processing or review.
