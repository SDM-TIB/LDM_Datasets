To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value Penalized Q-Learning for Recommender Systems" by Chengqian Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. I will look for the names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific characteristics that define these datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 3, I find that the authors mention two datasets: **Retailrocket** and **Yoochoose**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific metrics used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for anyone who may want to access the datasets or learn more about them.

1. For the **Retailrocket dataset**, the citation is:
   > Retailrocket. *E-commerce Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

2. For the **Yoochoose dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yoochoose. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/.

With the dataset names and their citations in hand, I will summarize the findings:

- **Retailrocket**: A dataset used for evaluating recommender systems, available on Kaggle.
- **Yoochoose**: A dataset specifically designed for recommender system challenges, available through the ACM RecSys conference.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
