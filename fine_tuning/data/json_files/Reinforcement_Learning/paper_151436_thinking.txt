To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trackable Island-model Genetic Algorithms at Wafer Scale" by Matthew Andres Moreno et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it mentions benchmarks and evolutionary processes, it does not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will need to dig deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the capabilities of the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) and the potential for evolutionary computation but do not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **methods section** closely. Here, the authors describe their implementation of an island-model genetic algorithm and mention using "on-hardware GA benchmarks" but still do not specify any datasets. 

Moving on to the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe their trials and the configurations used, but they do not explicitly name any datasets either.

Since the paper does not seem to mention any specific datasets directly, I will check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any potential datasets that might have been used in their experiments or that are relevant to their work. 

In the **references**, I will look for any papers that might describe datasets or benchmarks that the authors could have utilized. For instance, they reference works related to evolutionary computation and phylogenetic inference, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works, but none of them explicitly mention datasets that are directly used in their experiments. The references primarily discuss methodologies and frameworks rather than specific datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. However, I will note the relevant references that could be useful for understanding the context of their work.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, including the full citation for the paper itself, and summarize my findings regarding the absence of specific datasets.

In summary, I will document that while the paper discusses methodologies and frameworks for evolutionary computation, it does not provide specific datasets for extraction.
