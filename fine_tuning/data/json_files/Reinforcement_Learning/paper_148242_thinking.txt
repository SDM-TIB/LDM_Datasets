To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning an Interpretable Traffic Signal Control Policy" by James Ault et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical study section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using traffic demand data from the **Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)**, which is a key dataset for their simulations.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The UDOT database is referenced, and I will ensure to extract the complete citation for it.

The relevant dataset identified is:

1. **UDOT Traffic Demand Database**: This dataset specifies the observed traffic demand for 2092 signalized intersections, detailing the number of vehicles affiliated with each incoming and outgoing road combination over 5-minute intervals.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the UDOT dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Utah Department of Transportation. *ATSPM: Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures*. Retrieved from https://udottraffic.utah.gov/ATSPM.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
