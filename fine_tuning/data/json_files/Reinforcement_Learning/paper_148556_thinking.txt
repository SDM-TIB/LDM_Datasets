To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Mean-Squared Error of Double Q-Learning" by Wentao Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described in detail.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or evaluations. The authors may describe the environments or benchmarks they used, which often include specific datasets.

Next, I will check for any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. These visual aids often provide concise information about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will then consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **CartPole dataset** from OpenAI Gym, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
