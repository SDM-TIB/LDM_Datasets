To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaskMA: Towards Zero-Shot Multi-Agent Decision Making with Mask-Based Collaborative Learning" by Jie Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details the datasets used in experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of zero-shot transfer in multi-agent decision-making and hint at the use of a benchmark for evaluation. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In this paper, they mention using the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they collected expert trajectories from 11 training maps in SMAC, yielding 11 offline datasets. Each dataset consists of 10,000 episodes, which is significant for understanding the scale and nature of the data used.

Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset referenced is the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, which is foundational for their experiments.

The citation for the SMAC benchmark is:
> Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems, pages 2186â€“2188, 2019.

Additionally, the authors mention using expert policies trained with a method called ACE, which is also relevant for understanding the datasets used in their experiments. The citation for ACE is:
> Chuming Li, Jie Liu, Yinmin Zhang, Yuhong Wei, Yazhe Niu, Yaodong Yang, Yu Liu, and Wanli Ouyang. *ACE: Cooperative Multi-Agent Q-Learning with Bidirectional Action-Dependency*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
