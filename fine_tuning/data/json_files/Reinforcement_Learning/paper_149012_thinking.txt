To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A coevolutionary approach to deep multi-agent reinforcement learning" by Daan Klijn and A.E. Eiben, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions benchmarking two Deep Coevolutionary Algorithms on a range of multi-agent Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be included.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and mention the use of benchmark problems. I will look for specific names of datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the algorithms and the environments used for testing. In **section 5.2 (Atari environments and preprocessing)**, the authors explicitly state that they tested their algorithms on eight different multi-player Atari games from the **PettingZoo benchmark environments**. This is a key dataset that I need to note.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the specific games used for evaluation. The authors list the games as follows:
1. Basketball
2. Pong
3. Boxing
4. Combat Plane
5. Combat Tank
6. Joust
7. Space War
8. Tennis

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **PettingZoo** dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the PettingZoo benchmark is:
> Justin K Terry, Benjamin Black, Ananth Hari, Luis Santos, Clemens Dieffendahl, Niall L Williams, Yashas Lokesh, Caroline Horsch, and Praveen Ravi. *PettingZoo: Gym for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.14471 (2020).

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **PettingZoo Benchmark Environments**: This dataset includes a collection of multi-player Atari games used for evaluating the proposed algorithms.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PettingZoo dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
