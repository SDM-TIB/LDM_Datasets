To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SADA: Semantic Adversarial Diagnostic Attacks for Autonomous Applications" by Abdullah Hamdi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their proposed method (BBGAN) on three different tasks related to autonomous navigation, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **applications** section, where the authors describe the three tasks: object detection, self-driving, and UAV racing. Each task likely corresponds to a specific dataset. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for these tasks.

In the **object detection** subsection, the authors mention using the **Pascal-3D** dataset, which consists of 100 shapes of 12 object classes. I will note this dataset and its details.

In the **self-driving** subsection, the authors refer to the **CARLA** simulator, which is a well-known open-source urban driving simulator. I will confirm if they mention any specific datasets associated with CARLA.

In the **UAV racing** subsection, the authors mention using **Sim4CV**, a simulator for computer vision applications. I will check if they specify any datasets related to UAV racing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper documentation.

1. **Pascal-3D Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Xiang, Y., Mottaghi, R., & Savarese, S. (2014). *Beyond Pascal: A benchmark for 3D object detection in the wild*. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

2. **CARLA Simulator**:
   - Citation: Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
