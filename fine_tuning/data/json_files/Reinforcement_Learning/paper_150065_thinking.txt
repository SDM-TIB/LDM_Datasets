To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Visual Quadrotor Navigation" by Jack Saunders et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a simulation framework built on AirSim for training quadrotors, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the simulation or training environments.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly where the authors describe their simulation setup and the environments used for training. They mention modifying AirSim to improve capabilities for parallel reinforcement learning, which indicates that the environments created within AirSim could be considered datasets.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or environments used in their experiments. The authors discuss the training and validation environments created within Unreal Engine, which are depicted in figures. However, they do not provide specific names for datasets but rather describe the environments in general terms.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets or benchmarks are cited that may have been used in their experiments. The references include various works related to reinforcement learning and quadrotor navigation, but I need to determine if any of these are datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about the datasets or environments used, ensuring to include full citations for any referenced works. If the authors did not provide specific dataset names, I will note that the environments were created using AirSim and Unreal Engine, but no formal datasets were cited.

Finally, I will document the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset or environment is clearly described along with its citation, if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
