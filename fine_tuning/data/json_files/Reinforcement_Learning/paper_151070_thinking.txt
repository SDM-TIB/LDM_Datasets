To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving: Real-World Experiments" by Can Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the framework "Talk2Drive" and its application in real-world experiments, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper to find any references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for testing and validation are described. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the **experimental setup** subsection, the authors describe the vehicle used for experiments and the test track, but they do not mention any datasets directly. However, they refer to various metrics and evaluations, which may imply the use of datasets for analysis.

I will also check the **related works section** (Section II) for any references to datasets used in previous studies that may be relevant to the current research. This could provide context or lead to datasets that the authors might have used or built upon.

After thoroughly reviewing these sections, if I find any datasets mentioned, I will document them carefully. For each dataset, I will ensure to extract the full citation from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I identify any datasets, I will note down the following details for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the paper's references.

If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will conclude that the paper may not provide any datasets for public use or reference.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation for future reference.
