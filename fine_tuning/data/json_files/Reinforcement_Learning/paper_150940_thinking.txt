To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model predictive control–based value estimation for efficient reinforcement learning" by Qizhen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method demonstrates effectiveness in "classic databases" and "a dynamic obstacle avoidance scenario for an unmanned aerial vehicle." This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors compare their method with traditional reinforcement learning methods. They mention conducting experiments in "classic simulation environments" such as **Cliff Walking (CW)**, **CartPole (CP)**, **Pendulum (PD)**, and **Humanoid (HO)**. These are likely datasets or environments used for testing their approach.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets used in the UAV dynamic obstacle avoidance problem. The paper describes the environment model and the state transition and reward functions, but it does not explicitly mention a dataset name for this scenario. However, it does refer to the simulation setup, which may imply the use of a specific dataset or simulation environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references several works that may provide context or details about the datasets used in the experiments. 

1. For **OpenAI Gym environments** (CW, CP, PD, HO), the citation is:
   > Brockman, G., et al. "OpenAI Gym." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540* (2016).

2. For the **UAV path planning** and obstacle avoidance, the citation is:
   > Chen, Y. b., Luo, G. c., Mei, Y. s., Yu, J. q., & Su, X. l. "UAV path planning using artificial potential field method updated by optimal control theory." *Int. J. Syst. Sci.*, vol. 47, no. 6, pp. 1407–1420, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
