To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Industry-near Environments" by Morten Per-Arne Andersen, Morten Goodwin, and Ole-Christoffer Granmo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm and mentions a simulated environment called **Deep Warehouse**. This suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (The Deep Warehouse Environment)**, where the authors describe the environment in detail. They mention that the Deep Warehouse is a simulated environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms, which implies that it may serve as a dataset for training and evaluation.

In this section, the authors state that the Deep Warehouse environment is open-source and freely available at a specific GitHub repository. This is crucial information as it indicates that the environment can be accessed and potentially used as a dataset for further research.

Now, I will look for any references to other datasets or environments used in their experiments. The authors mention using **Deep RTS** and **Deep Line Wars** as environments for testing their algorithm. I will need to check if these environments are also available as datasets.

I will then consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned:

1. **Deep Warehouse**: The citation is:

2. **Deep RTS**: The citation is:

3. **Deep Line Wars**: The citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
