To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing the Digital Annealer with Classical Evolutionary Algorithm" by Mayowa Ayodele, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the author typically details the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I find that the author mentions using common instances for the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP), Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) sourced from specific libraries.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MKP instances**: Taken from ORLIB.
2. **QAP instances**: Taken from QAPLIB (Burkard et al. [1997]).
3. **TSP instances**: Taken from TSPLIB (Reinelt [1991]).

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ORLIB**, the citation is:
  > J. E. Beasley. *ORLIB: A Library of Test Problems for Combinatorial Optimization*. 1990. Available at: http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/

- For **QAPLIB**, the citation is:
  > Rainer E. Burkard, Stefan E. Karisch, and Franz Rendl. *QAPLIB - A Quadratic Assignment Problem Library*. Journal of Global Optimization, 10(4):391–403, 1997.

- For **TSPLIB**, the citation is:
  > Gerhard Reinelt. *TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library*. ORSA Journal on Computing, 3(4):376–384, 1991.

After collecting this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset in the required format, including the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and attributed.
