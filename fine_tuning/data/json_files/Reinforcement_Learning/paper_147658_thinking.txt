To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Motion Gaming AI for Health Promotion" by Pujana Paliyawan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the AI's purpose and the context of the experiment, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the use of motion capture devices and the importance of balancing body segment usage, but it does not name any specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the data collection process or databases used. The paper mentions the use of a middleware called UKI for integrating full-body control with the game FightingICE, but it does not explicitly list datasets.

In the **data and databases section**, the authors describe two key components: 
1. **Momentum of body movement**: This section explains how raw data captured by Kinect is processed to analyze player movements, but it does not refer to a specific dataset.
2. **Action-to-counteraction probability**: This section mentions that the data is built using gameplay logs from 45 battle rounds involving 5 subjects, but again, it does not provide a formal dataset name.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of studies and articles related to health promotion and gaming, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the data collection methods and the types of data analyzed, they do not provide formal names for any datasets. Therefore, I will note that no specific datasets were identified in this paper.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references that may pertain to the methodologies or tools used, even if they do not constitute datasets themselves.

In conclusion, I will document my findings clearly, indicating that no formal datasets were extracted from this paper, but I will reference the methodologies and tools discussed for context.
