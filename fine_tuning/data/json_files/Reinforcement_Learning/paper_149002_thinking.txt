To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian Approach to Reinforcement Learning of Vision-Based Vehicular Control" by Zahra Gharaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator** for training and evaluation, which suggests that the simulator itself may provide a dataset or benchmark.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing the experimental setup. Here, the authors describe the training environment and the types of data used. They mention using both **ground truth** and **estimated semantic segmentation** inputs, which indicates that these are key datasets for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors specify that they trained their system in a simulated urban environment using the **CARLA simulator**. This simulator is known for providing various sensor inputs, including RGB images and semantic segmentation maps. I will note that the CARLA simulator is a significant dataset for their work.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced in the context of performance evaluation. The authors compare their method against other approaches, which may involve additional datasets or benchmarks.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CARLA simulator is referenced, and I will ensure to include its citation in the dataset documentation.

The full citation for the CARLA simulator is:

Now, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
