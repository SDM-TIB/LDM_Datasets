To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realistic Rainy Weather Simulation for LiDARs in CARLA Simulator" by Donglin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a synthetic point cloud dataset for LiDAR data under rainy conditions, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they collected a total of **10,000 frames of data under various rainfall conditions** using the CARLA simulator. This is a clear indication of a dataset being created for their experiments.

In this section, they also discuss the merging of their synthetic dataset with the **Waymo Open Dataset**. This is crucial as it indicates that they are utilizing an existing dataset alongside their own.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Waymo Open Dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of autonomous driving. The citation for the Waymo Open Dataset is:

- **Waymo Open Dataset**:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, A., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, Y., Zhou, Y., Chai, B., Caine, B., et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2020, pp. 2446â€“2454.

Additionally, the authors mention that their synthetic dataset will be made publicly available, but they do not provide a specific citation for it in the text. Since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will note it as follows:

- **Synthetic Point Cloud Dataset**:
  > Yang, D., Liu, Z., Jiang, W., Yan, G., Gao, X., Shi, B., Liu, S., Cai, X. "Realistic Rainy Weather Simulation for LiDARs in CARLA Simulator." Dataset available at: https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/PCSim#rainypcsim.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
