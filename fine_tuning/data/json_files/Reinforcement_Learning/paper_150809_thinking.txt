To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Q-learning Approach for Adherence-Aware Recommendations" by Ioannis Faros et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and provide numerical examples, which may include datasets used for simulations or experiments. I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets in the **numerical examples section** (Section IV), as this is where the authors typically describe the scenarios they tested their algorithm on.

In the **numerical examples section**, the authors discuss two scenarios: an inventory control problem and a machine replacement problem. They mention the use of specific parameters and conditions for these scenarios, but I need to check if they reference any publicly available datasets or if they created synthetic data for their experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters and conditions of their simulations without citing any external datasets. This indicates that the experiments were likely conducted using custom or synthetic data rather than established datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to reference. However, I will summarize the scenarios and the parameters used in the experiments for clarity.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the absence of external datasets while summarizing the experimental setups described in the paper.
