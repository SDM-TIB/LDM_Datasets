To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interleaving Fast and Slow Decision Making" by Aditya Gulati, Sarthak Soni, and Shrisha Rao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using a modified version of the classic Pac-Man game. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets or environments they reference, particularly in the **experiments section** where they detail the setup and methodologies used.

As I read through the **experiments section**, I will note any datasets or environments mentioned. For instance, the paper discusses using a modified Pac-Man game as a testbed for their framework. While this is not a traditional dataset, it is essential to document it as it serves as the experimental environment for their research.

After identifying the datasets or environments, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, since the paper primarily discusses a game environment rather than traditional datasets, I will ensure to note any relevant references that describe the game mechanics or algorithms used, such as the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm.

If the paper references any foundational works or datasets related to reinforcement learning or decision-making systems, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset or environment is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, even if they are not traditional datasets in the sense of structured data collections.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
