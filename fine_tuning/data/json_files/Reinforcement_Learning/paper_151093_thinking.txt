To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Heat Alert Issuance for Public Health in the United States with Reinforcement Learning" by Ellen M. Considine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a nationwide dataset spanning 2006-2016, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention a **US county-level dataset** that includes daily observations from the warm months of 2006 through 2016, specifically for counties with populations greater than 65,000. This dataset includes features such as the population-weighted maximum heat index, heat alerts issued by the National Weather Service (NWS), and hospitalizations from Medicare claims.

The authors also mention that they compiled county-level estimates of other features, including population density, median household income, broadband usage data, presidential election returns, and PM2.5 air pollution. This indicates that multiple datasets are being utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **US County-Level Dataset**: This dataset is used for analyzing heat alert effectiveness and includes various features related to health and environmental factors. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be a compilation of publicly available data.

2. **U.S. Census Bureau Data**: The authors reference the U.S. Census Bureau for median household income data. The citation is:
   > U.S. Census Bureau. “2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-year County-level Estimates of Population and Median Household Income.” (2014).

3. **PM2.5 Air Pollution Data**: The authors cite a study for PM2.5 air pollution data:
   > Hammer, M. S., van Donkelaar, A., Li, C., et al. “Global Estimates and Long-Term Trends of Fine Particulate Matter Concentrations (1998–2018).” Environmental Science & Technology, 54(13):7879–7890, 2020.

4. **Broadband Usage Data**: The citation for broadband usage data is:
   > Microsoft AI for Good Research Lab. “U.S. Broadband Usage Percentages Dataset.” (2021).

5. **Presidential Election Returns**: The citation for this data is:
   > MIT Election Data and Science Lab. “County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020.” (2018).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for any referenced datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
