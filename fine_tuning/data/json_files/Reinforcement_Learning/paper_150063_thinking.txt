To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual VQA for Disaster Response Systems" by Aditya Kane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **FloodNet dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of disaster response systems and mention the **FloodNet dataset** again, emphasizing its relevance to their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **FloodNet dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a VQA dataset based on aerial images of flooded areas and provide details about its structure, including the number of question-answer pairs and images.

I will also check the **appendix** where the dataset is elaborated further. The authors mention that the dataset consists of 4,511 question-answer pairs across 1,448 images, with specific splits for training and testing. This detailed description confirms the dataset's significance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **FloodNet dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Maryam Rahnemoonfar, Tashnim Chowdhury, Argho Sarkar, Debvrat Varshney, Masoud Yari, and Robin Murphy. *FloodNet: A high resolution aerial imagery dataset for post flood scene understanding*. 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **FloodNet Dataset**: A VQA dataset based on aerial images of flooded areas, consisting of 4,511 question-answer pairs across 1,448 images. The training split includes 3,620 questions associated with 1,158 images, while the testing split consists of 891 questions for 290 images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution.
