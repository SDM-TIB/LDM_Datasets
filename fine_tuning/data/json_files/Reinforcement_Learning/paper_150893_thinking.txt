To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Monte Carlo Tree Search with Probability Tree State Abstraction" by Yangqing Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on various tasks, but they do not explicitly list any datasets in the abstract or introduction. Therefore, I will closely examine the **experiments section** to find any references to datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using **Atari benchmarks** and **Gym benchmarks** for their evaluations. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these benchmarks in the main text.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe these benchmarks. The Atari benchmarks are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, and I can find their citation as follows:

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.0576.

The Gym benchmarks are also widely recognized, and their citation is:
- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Atari Benchmarks**:
   - Citation: Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.0576.

2. **OpenAI Gym Benchmarks**:
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or review.
