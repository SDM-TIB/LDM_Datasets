To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Move Evaluation in Go Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Chris J. Maddison et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a convolutional neural network using a database of human professional games, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of constructing an evaluation function for Go and mention the use of a large database of professional 19x19 Go games for training. This reinforces the idea that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Moving on to the **data section (Section 3)**, I will look for explicit descriptions of the dataset. The authors provide detailed information about the dataset, which comes from the KGS Go Server. They mention that it consists of sequences of board positions from complete games played between humans, totaling 29.4 million board-state next-move pairs corresponding to 160,000 games. This section also describes the features used as inputs to the CNN, which further clarifies the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KGS Go Server dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific online platform rather than a traditional publication, I will note that the citation may not follow standard formats. Instead, I will provide a description of the dataset's source.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **KGS Go Server Dataset**: This dataset consists of 29.4 million board-state next-move pairs collected from 160,000 games played by human players of varying ranks on the KGS Go Server. The dataset includes detailed board state information, such as the position of all stones on the 19x19 board and various features relevant to the game.

Since the KGS Go Server is an online platform and does not have a formal citation like a journal article, I will note it as follows:
> KGS Go Server. *KGS Go Server Database*. Available at: http://www.gokgs.com/

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
