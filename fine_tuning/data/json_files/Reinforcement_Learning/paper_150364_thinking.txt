To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Noise Filtering with Dynamic Sparse Training in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ghada Sokar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the formulation of a problem setting in reinforcement learning called the extremely noisy environment (ENE), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors describe the challenges faced by reinforcement learning agents in noisy environments but again do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology** section, particularly **Section 4 (Automatic Noise Filtering)**, I will look for any datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention applying their method to four continuous control tasks from the MuJoCo Gym suite: **Humanoid-v3, HalfCheetah-v3, Walker2d-v3, and Hopper-v3**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experimental setup and confirm that they used the aforementioned MuJoCo Gym environments for their evaluations. This reinforces that these environments are indeed the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the MuJoCo environments are as follows:

- **MuJoCo Gym**: 
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033, 2012. URL: https://mujoco.org/.

I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Humanoid-v3**: A continuous control task environment in the MuJoCo Gym suite.
2. **HalfCheetah-v3**: Another continuous control task environment in the MuJoCo Gym suite.
3. **Walker2d-v3**: A continuous control task environment in the MuJoCo Gym suite.
4. **Hopper-v3**: A continuous control task environment in the MuJoCo Gym suite.

Each of these datasets will be cited with the full reference to the MuJoCo Gym paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
