To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Using Contrastive Rewards" by Wei Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and mention that their approach is evaluated using various datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Anthropic/HH-RLHF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 161,000 conversations between humans and AI assistants, with each instance containing a pair of responses generated by a language model and a preference label indicating the preferred response. The authors note that they mixed two subsets (helpful and harmless) for their experiments.

2. **OpenAI/Summary Dataset**: This dataset includes Reddit posts along with two summaries for each post, annotated with human preferences. It contains 117,000 training samples and 13,000 validation samples.

3. **PKU/Safety Alignment Dataset**: This dataset comprises 297,000 conversation comparisons, each linked to preference and safety labels. After filtering for safety compliance, they retained 95,000 pairs for training and 10,000 pairs for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Anthropic/HH-RLHF Dataset**:
  > Ganguli, D., Lovitt, L., Kernion, J., Askell, A., Bai, Y., Kadavath, S., Mann, B., Perez, E., Schiefer, N., Ndousse, K., Jones, A., Bowman, S., Chen, A., Conerly, T., DasSarma, N., Drain, D., Elhage, N., El-Showk, S., Fort, S., Hatfield-Dodds, Z., Henighan, T., Hernandez, D., Hume, T., Jacobson, J., Johnston, S., Kravec, S., Olsson, C., Ringer, S., Tran-Johnson, E., Amodei, D., Brown, T., Joseph, N., McCandlish, S., Olah, C., Kaplan, J., and Clark, J. *Red teaming language models to reduce harms: Methods, scaling behaviors, and lessons learned*. 2022.

- For the **OpenAI/Summary Dataset**:
  > Stiennon, N., Ouyang, L., Wu, J., Ziegler, D. M., Lowe, R., Voss, C., Radford, A., Amodei, D., and Christiano, P. *Learning to summarize from human feedback*. 2022.

- For the **PKU/Safety Alignment Dataset**:
  > Dai, J., Pan, X., Sun, R., Ji, J., Xu, X., Liu, M., Wang, Y., and Yang, Y. *Safe RLHF: Safe reinforcement learning from human feedback*. 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
