To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Generation of Scenarios for System-level Simulation-based Verification of Autonomous Driving Systems" by Srajan Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator** and its **ScenarioRunner tool**, which suggests that these tools may involve datasets or scenarios relevant to autonomous driving systems.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Autonomous Driving Application)**, where the authors describe the instantiation of the VIVAS framework for the ADS application. Here, they mention the **CARLA simulator** and its community, which provides various AI-based solutions for autonomous driving. I will look for specific datasets or scenario specifications that are utilized in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.1 (CARLA Simulation Model and AI Components)**, the authors discuss the CARLA simulator and its capabilities. They mention that the CARLA community provides various AI solutions, but I need to check if they explicitly name any datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

In **subsection 5.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors provide parameters for the vehicles and environment, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they refer to the **CARLA Autonomous Driving Leaderboard**, which may imply the use of datasets associated with that leaderboard.

To ensure I have captured all relevant datasets, I will also review the **References section** for any citations that may refer to datasets or benchmarks used in the context of the CARLA simulator or the VIVAS framework.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets and their full citations. If specific datasets are not named in the paper, I will note that the authors primarily rely on the CARLA simulator and its community resources for scenario generation and validation.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation as required, documenting the source of the dataset or benchmark used in the research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on section 4 for specific datasets or scenario specifications.
3. Review the references for any relevant citations.
4. Compile the datasets with full citations, noting any that are not explicitly named.
