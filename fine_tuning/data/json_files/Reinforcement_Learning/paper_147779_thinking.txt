To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Adaptive Display Exposure for Real-Time Advertising" by Weixun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on **industry-scale real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors state that they evaluated their approach using **real-world datasets from the Taobao platform**. This suggests that there is at least one dataset related to Taobao.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional details about the datasets used, such as their characteristics or how they were collected. The paper discusses the data collection scenario and mentions that they replay users' access logs in chronological order to simulate user requests. However, it does not provide specific names for the datasets.

Since the paper does not provide detailed citations for the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find any papers or sources that might describe the datasets used. The authors do not cite a specific dataset paper for the Taobao data, but they do reference various works related to reinforcement learning and advertising.

Given that the dataset is from the Taobao platform, I will provide a citation for the platform itself, as it is a significant source of data for the experiments. The citation for Taobao is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the platform as follows:

- **Taobao Dataset**: 
  > Taobao. *Taobao E-commerce Platform*. Available at: https://www.taobao.com/

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: The dataset used for the experiments is derived from the Taobao platform, which includes user access logs and advertising data.

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets or specific citations, I will conclude my extraction here. I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
