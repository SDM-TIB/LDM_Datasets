To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mutual-Information Regularization in Markov Decision Processes and Actor-Critic Learning" by Felix Leibfried and Jordi Grau-Moya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical validation of the MIRACLE algorithm in the Mujoco robotics simulator, which suggests that datasets related to Mujoco environments may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their empirical validation of the MIRACLE algorithm across various Mujoco environments. They mention several environments, including **Pendulum-v0, InvertedDoublePendulum-v2, Swimmer-v2, Reacher-v2, Ant-v2, Humanoid-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Hopper-v2**. Each of these environments serves as a dataset for testing the algorithm.

To ensure I have the correct context and details, I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to these environments. Mujoco is a well-known physics engine for robotics simulations, and the datasets for these environments are typically referenced in the literature.

The full citation for the Mujoco environments is as follows:
- **Mujoco**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Pendulum-v0**
2. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v2**
3. **Swimmer-v2**
4. **Reacher-v2**
5. **Ant-v2**
6. **Humanoid-v2**
7. **Walker2d-v2**
8. **Hopper-v2**

Each of these datasets corresponds to a Mujoco environment used for empirical validation in the paper, and the citation for Mujoco has been noted for reference.
