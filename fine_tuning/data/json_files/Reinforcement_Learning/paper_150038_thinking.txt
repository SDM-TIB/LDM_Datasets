To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Route Planning for Last-Mile Deliveries Using Mobile Parcel Lockers: A Hybrid Q-Learning Network Approach," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any discussions about prior research or datasets that the authors may have used or referenced. This section often provides context and may mention specific datasets relevant to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the data collection process, the characteristics of the datasets, and how they were utilized in the study. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods in relation to the datasets. This may provide additional insights into the datasets' significance and usage.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets may include:

1. **Customer demand data**: This could be a dataset detailing customer locations, time windows, and demand patterns.
2. **Mobile parcel locker data**: Information about the characteristics and operational parameters of the mobile parcel lockers used in the study.
3. **Simulation or experimental data**: Results from the experiments conducted, which may include metrics such as delivery times, service delays, and optimization performance.

I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset as I extract them, following the appropriate citation format used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
