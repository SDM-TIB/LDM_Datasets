To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memorizing Documents with Guidance in Large Language Models" by Bumjin Park and Jaesik Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the experimental results on **Wikitext-103-v1**, which suggests that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention training the model on **Wikitext-103-v1**. This confirms that this dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wikitext-103-v1 dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

- **Wikitext-103-v1**: 
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the Wikitext-103-v1 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
