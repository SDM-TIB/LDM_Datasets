To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Sum Positional Differential Games as a Framework for Robust Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning Approach" by Anton Plaksin and Vitaly Kalev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are more likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of Robust Reinforcement Learning (RRL) and its applications, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithms.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors list several environments that serve as datasets for their experiments. They mention:

1. **EscapeFromZero**: A game where the first agent aims to maximize its distance from zero.
2. **GetIntoCircle**: A game where one agent tries to minimize its distance to zero while the other tries to maximize it.
3. **GetIntoSquare**: Similar to GetIntoCircle but with a square boundary.
4. **HomicidalChauffeur**: A pursuit-evasion game.
5. **Interception**: An air interception task.
6. **InvertedPendulum**: A task from the MuJoCo simulator.
7. **Swimmer**: Another task from the MuJoCo simulator.
8. **HalfCheetah**: A task from the MuJoCo simulator.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The authors reference several foundational papers and sources that describe these environments. 

For example, the citations for the environments are as follows:

- **EscapeFromZero**: Subbotin, A. (1995). *Generalized Solutions of First Order PDEs: the Dynamical Optimization Perspective*. Birkh¨auser, Berlin.
- **GetIntoCircle**: Kamneva, L. (2019). *Computation of solvability set for differential games in the plane with simple motion and non-convex terminal set*. Dynamic Games and Applications, 9:724–750.
- **GetIntoSquare**: Patsko, V. (1996). *Special aspects of convex hull constructing in linear differential games of small dimension*. IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 29(8):19–24.
- **HomicidalChauffeur**: Isaacs, R. (1965). *Differential Games: A Mathematical Theory with Applications to Warfare and Pursuit, Control and Optimization*. John Wiley and Sons, Inc.
- **Interception**: Kumkov, S. S., Patsko, V. S., and Shinar, J. (2005). *On level sets with “narrow throats” in linear differential games*. International Game Theory Review, 7(3):285–311.
- **InvertedPendulum**: Todorov, E., Erez, T., and Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.
- **Swimmer**: Todorov, E., Erez, T., and Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.
- **HalfCheetah**: Todorov, E., Erez, T., and Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
