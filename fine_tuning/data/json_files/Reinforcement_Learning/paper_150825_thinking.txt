To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asteroids co-orbital motion classification based on Machine Learning" by Giulia Ciacci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors built **three datasets**: Real, Ideal, and Perturbed, which are essential for training and testing their machine learning algorithms.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets:

1. **Real Dataset**: This dataset consists of time series data of 50 asteroids that exhibit regular co-orbital motion (Tadpole, Horseshoe, Quasi-satellite). The data is obtained from the JPL HORIZONS system and covers a time span of about 900 years.

2. **Ideal Simulated Dataset**: This dataset includes 1999 time series of ideal cases generated by simulating the motion of asteroids in co-orbital dynamics. The simulations are based on the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and cover a time span of 3000 years.

3. **Perturbed Simulated Dataset**: This dataset contains 347 time series that deviate from the ideal cases by introducing perturbations. These perturbations are designed to resemble the behavior of real asteroids while still being based on the ideal cases. This dataset also covers a time span of 3000 years.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. The paper cites the JPL HORIZONS system for the real dataset, but it does not provide a formal citation for the simulated datasets since they are generated by the authors' own methods.

The citation for the JPL HORIZONS system is:
> NASA. (2022). JPL HORIZONS System. Retrieved from https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.htm

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. Real Dataset: Time series of 50 asteroids from JPL HORIZONS (NASA, 2022).
2. Ideal Simulated Dataset: 1999 time series generated from CR3BP.
3. Perturbed Simulated Dataset: 347 time series with perturbations based on ideal cases.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant citations for future reference.
