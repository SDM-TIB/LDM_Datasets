To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretrain Soft Q-Learning with Imperfect Demonstrations" by Xiaoqin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks from Atari 2600, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention that the datasets of expert demonstrations contain trajectories of {st, at} and that each dataset for one environment contains around 40,000 time steps. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that the datasets are generated from an agent trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, they do not provide specific names for the datasets used in the experiments. Instead, they refer to the environments (e.g., SpaceInvaders, Pong, DemonAttack, MsPacman) but do not give formal dataset names.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will need to infer the appropriate references based on the environments mentioned. The Atari 2600 environments are well-known, and I can provide citations for the original Atari Learning Environment and the PPO algorithm.

The relevant citations I will include are:

1. For the Atari Learning Environment:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. For the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm:
   > Schulman, J., Wolski, F., Dhariwal, P., Radford, A., & Klimov, O. (2017). Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.06347*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citations for the Atari environments and the PPO algorithm as they are relevant to the datasets used in the experiments.
