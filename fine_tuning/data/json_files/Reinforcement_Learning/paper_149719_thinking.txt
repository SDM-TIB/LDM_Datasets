To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VQTTS: High-Fidelity Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Self-Supervised VQ Acoustic Feature" by Chenpeng Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the context of text-to-speech synthesis but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors mention using the **LJSpeech dataset**. This dataset is described as containing about 24 hours of speech recorded by a female speaker, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Ito, K. (2017). *The LJ-Speech Dataset*. Retrieved from https://keithito.com/ljspeechdataset/

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding the LJSpeech dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **LJSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used in the experiments and is essential for the evaluation of the proposed TTS system.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for the LJSpeech dataset. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
