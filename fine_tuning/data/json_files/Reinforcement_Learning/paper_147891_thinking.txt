To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACTRCE: Augmenting Experience via Teacher’s Advice for Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning" by Harris Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two environments: **KrazyGrid World** and **ViZDoom**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments to determine if they are associated with specific datasets.

In **subsection 4.1 (Environments and Training)**, the authors describe the **KrazyGrid World** as a 2D grid environment with specific goals and attributes. They also mention the **ViZDoom** environment, which is based on the first-person shooter game Doom. I will note the details provided about these environments, as they may serve as datasets for the experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information regarding the datasets, such as specific configurations, instructions, or variations used in the experiments. The authors often include supplementary material that can provide further insights into the datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. For the environments, I will cite the original papers that describe them:

1. **KrazyGrid World**:
   - Citation: 
     > Stadie, B., Yang, G., Houthooft, R., Chen, P., Duan, Y., Wu, Y., Abbeel, P., & Sutskever, I. (2018). The importance of sampling in meta-reinforcement learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 9300–9310).

2. **ViZDoom**:
   - Citation:

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
