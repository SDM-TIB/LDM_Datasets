To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Inspection Method of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Power Plants Using Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning" by Haoran Guan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and method sections, as they often contain specific references to datasets used in experiments.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the application of UAVs in power plant inspections and mentions the use of reinforcement learning techniques. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here. I will continue to the **method section**, where the author describes the UAV self-inspection model and the environment created for the experiments. This section may provide insights into any datasets or simulation environments used.

As I read through the **method section**, I will look for any references to datasets, such as simulation environments or real-world data used for training the model. If the author mentions any specific datasets or simulation parameters, I will note them down.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if the author discusses the performance of the model on any specific datasets or environments. This section may provide additional context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the author refers to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset.

If I find any datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing complete citations for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
