To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Temporal-Difference and Q-Learning Learn Representation? A Mean-Field Theory" by Yufeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

Then, I will examine the **methodology** or **experiments section**, which usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section is crucial as it often provides specifics about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **OpenAI Gym** dataset, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
