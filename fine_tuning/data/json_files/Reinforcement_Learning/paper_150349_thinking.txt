To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Dropout: A Simple yet Effective Variance Reduction Technique in Deep Policy Optimization" by Zichuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the sample dropout technique on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on several benchmarks, specifically:

1. **MuJoCo**: This is a physics engine for model-based control, widely used in reinforcement learning research. The authors reference it as a benchmark for continuous control tasks.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite (DMControl)**: This suite includes a variety of continuous control tasks and is also mentioned as a benchmark for their experiments.

3. **Atari Games**: The paper discusses the performance of their method across 49 Atari games, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets or benchmarks:

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:

- For **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
