To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case Study: Using Genetic Algorithm for Job Scheduling Problem" by Burak TaÄŸtekin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that discuss datasets or experimental setups. In this paper, there is no dedicated section labeled "Datasets," so I will need to look for mentions of datasets within the text, particularly in the **methodology and results sections**. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to data used for testing the genetic algorithm, such as job scheduling scenarios or historical run time values. The authors mention testing their algorithm on "100 different builds," which suggests that they used a specific dataset or collection of data for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited works that may describe datasets used in the study. If the authors refer to existing datasets or benchmarks, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the necessary details for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the References section of the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for job scheduling, I will note its name, provide a description of its contents, and ensure I have the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
