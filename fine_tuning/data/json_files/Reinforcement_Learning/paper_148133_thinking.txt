To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUARL: Quantization for Reinforcement Learning" by Maximilian Lam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses applying quantization techniques to a comprehensive set of reinforcement learning tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention applying quantization to reinforcement learning tasks from **Atari** and **Gym**, which are well-known datasets in the reinforcement learning community.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific details about the performance of various algorithms on these datasets. They mention using different algorithms (A2C, DDPG, DQN, D4PG, PPO) on these environments, which reinforces the idea that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Atari dataset is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and the Gym environments are also well-documented.

For the **Atari dataset**, the citation is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *CoRR*, abs/1606.01540.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured clearly for any further processing or review.
