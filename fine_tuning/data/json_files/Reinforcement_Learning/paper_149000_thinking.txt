To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Laws with Board Games" by Andy L. Jones, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments using AlphaZero and Hex, but does not specify datasets. The introduction also focuses on scaling laws and does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will look for sections that might detail the methodology or experiments, particularly any sections that might discuss data collection or datasets used. I will pay special attention to sections labeled **Methods**, **Experiments**, or any section that might discuss the implementation of AlphaZero.

Upon reviewing the **Methods** section, I find that the author mentions training models on different board sizes of the game Hex, but there is no explicit dataset mentioned. The paper discusses the training process and the evaluation of agents but does not refer to any external datasets.

I will also check the **Acknowledgements** and **References** sections to see if any datasets are cited or if there are references to publicly available datasets. The references primarily cite other research papers and implementations related to AlphaZero and Hex, but do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the author has published code, models, and data on GitHub, which may contain relevant datasets or data formats used in the experiments.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, but I will include the citation for the paper itself and mention the GitHub repository for further exploration.

The full citation for the paper is:

I will also note that the GitHub repository mentioned in the paper is a potential source for datasets or data used in the experiments.
