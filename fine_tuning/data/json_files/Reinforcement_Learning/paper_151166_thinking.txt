To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Systematic Review of Available Datasets in Additive Manufacturing" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a structured approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the need for open and annotated datasets in additive manufacturing, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the systematic review process. This section outlines the criteria for dataset inclusion, which may lead to specific datasets being mentioned. I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets identified during the review.

In the **results section**, I will pay close attention to any tables that list datasets. For instance, Table 3 summarizes the datasets identified through the systematic review, and it indicates that only a small number of datasets are associated with additive manufacturing processes. I will extract the names of these datasets along with any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. For example, the paper mentions datasets like the emission images normal samples and defect samples, which I will need to cite correctly.

Here are the datasets I will extract based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Emission Images Normal Samples**: 
   - Citation: Liu, X. (2022). Emission images normal samples. Figshare. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.21280173.v1. URL: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/emission_images_normal_samples/21280173.

2. **Emission Images Defect Samples**: 
   - Citation: Liu, X. (2022). Emission images defect samples. Figshare. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.21280104.v1. URL: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/emission_images_defect_samples/21280104.

3. **Layer-wise Imaging Dataset from Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing Processes**: 
   - Citation: Scime, L., et al. (2023). Layer-wise imaging dataset from powder bed additive manufacturing processes for machine learning applications (Peregrine v2022-10). doi: 10.13139/ORNLNCCS/1923043.

4. **Image-based Dataset of Artifact Surfaces Fabricated by Additive Manufacturing**: 
   - Citation: Taheriboroujeni, J. (2021). Image-based dataset of artifact surfaces fabricated by additive manufacturing with applications in machine learning. doi: 10.17632/zyz6cznm5h.3. URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zyz6cznm5h/3.

5. **Feature-based CNN Network and Data for Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process**: 
   - Citation: Dong, G. (2021). Feature-based CNN network and data for laser powder bed fusion process. doi: 10.17632/8rm9d4ykbt.1. URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8rm9d4ykbt/1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
