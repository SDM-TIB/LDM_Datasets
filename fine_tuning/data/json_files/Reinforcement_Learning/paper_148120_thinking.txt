To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Modulated Hebbian plus Q Network Architecture" by Pawel Ladosz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may give insights into the experiments conducted and the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss two environments: **CT-graph** and **MALMO**. I will extract details about these environments as they serve as the datasets for the experiments:

1. **CT-graph Environment**: This is described as a configurable tree graph that encodes partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). It is used to create a set of confounding POMDP problems, which serve as benchmarks for the proposed architecture.

2. **MALMO Environment**: This environment is based on the game Minecraft and is designed to reflect characteristics of confounding POMDP problems. The authors mention that the agent receives observations and rewards while navigating through a maze-like structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, since CT-graph and MALMO are not traditional datasets with formal citations, I will note that they are environments created for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of the environments, along with any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. I will also ensure to provide proper citations for any referenced works that describe the environments or methodologies used.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
