To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You May Not Need Ratio Clipping in PPO" by Mingfei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or types of tasks they are used for.

In this paper, the authors mention using various benchmarks for their experiments, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning tasks. I will note down any datasets that are explicitly named or described in detail.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Mujoco** environment for their experiments, I would look for the citation that describes this environment in detail. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
