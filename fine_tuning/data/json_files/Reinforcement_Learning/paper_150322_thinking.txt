To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Global Convergence of Risk-Averse Policy Gradient Methods with Dynamic Time-Consistent Risk Measures" by Xian Yu and Lei Ying, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments. If the authors mention any standard benchmarks or datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who wants to access the datasets. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Cliï¬€walk environment," I will look for its original source or any relevant papers that describe it. If the dataset is a well-known benchmark, I will find its authoritative citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented, with proper citations, ready for any further processing or review.
