To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximate Exploitability: Learning a Best Response" by Finbarr Timbers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a new metric for evaluating policies in imperfect information games but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the use of games as benchmarks in AI but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluation section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned. In section 4.1, the authors describe their experiments with small imperfect information games, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Instead, they refer to games like Liarâ€™s Dice and Leduc Poker, which are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather game environments.

Continuing to section 4.3, the authors mention running experiments against known strategies in Heads-Up No-Limit Poker, again referring to the game rather than a dataset. The same pattern continues throughout the experimental sections, where the focus is on the algorithms and their performance rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of papers and articles related to game theory and reinforcement learning, without specific datasets being highlighted.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided or referenced in the context of this research. The experiments are conducted within the framework of established games rather than on specific datasets that can be cited.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as it primarily discusses algorithms and their performance in various game environments without referencing any specific datasets. If any datasets were mentioned, I would ensure to provide full citations for each, but in this case, there are none to report.
