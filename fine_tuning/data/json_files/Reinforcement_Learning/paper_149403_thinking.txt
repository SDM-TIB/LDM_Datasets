To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Q-learning solve Multi Armed Bandits?" by Refael Vivanti, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in solving Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of MAB problems and does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experimental results section**, I will focus on the details of the experiments conducted. The paper describes a Two-Armed-Bandit environment, which is a simulated scenario rather than a traditional dataset. The parameters for this environment are defined, but there are no external datasets referenced.

I will also check the **figures and tables** within the experimental results to see if any datasets are mentioned or if there are any references to data sources. The figures illustrate the performance of the Q-learning algorithm under different conditions but do not cite any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and cognitive experiments, but they do not specifically mention datasets used in this study.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the abstract, introduction, or experimental results.
- The experiments were conducted in a simulated Two-Armed-Bandit environment without reference to external datasets.
- The references do not provide citations for any datasets used in the study.

Thus, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
