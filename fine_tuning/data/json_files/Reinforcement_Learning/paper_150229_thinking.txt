To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Automatic Discovery of Multi-perspective Process Model using Reinforcement Learning" by Sunghyun Sim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach using "six real-world event datasets collected in port logistics, steel manufacturing, finance, IT, and government administration." This indicates that datasets are indeed present, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list six datasets (TL1 to TL6) and provide information about the number of cases, number of events, and a brief description of each dataset:

1. **TL1**: 
   - Number of Cases: 13,954
   - Number of Events: 55,004
   - Description: Logistic processes within a Korean port company.

2. **TL2**: 
   - Number of Cases: 77,405
   - Number of Events: 1,048,575
   - Description: Steel manufacturing processes within a Korean company.

3. **TL3**: 
   - Number of Cases: 13,087
   - Number of Events: 13,087
   - Description: Bank lending process in a Netherlands company.
   - Note: This dataset is publicly available and used in the Business Process Intelligence Challenge.

4. **TL4**: 
   - Number of Cases: 7,554
   - Number of Events: 65,533
   - Description: Incident management process within Volvo.

5. **TL5**: 
   - Number of Cases: 46,616
   - Number of Events: 644,738
   - Description: ITIL process within Rabobank Group.

6. **TL6**: 
   - Number of Cases: 1,199
   - Number of Events: 52,217
   - Description: Building permit processes from five Dutch municipalities.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are publicly available or have been previously published. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, so I will note that they are described in the context of the paper without external citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details that would be useful for someone looking to understand or access these datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference.
