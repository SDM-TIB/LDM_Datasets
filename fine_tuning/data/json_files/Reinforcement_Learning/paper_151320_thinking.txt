To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Crossover" by Eliad Shem-Tov and Achiya Elyasaf, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method across two benchmark domains: **bin packing** and **graph coloring**. This indicates that datasets related to these domains are likely discussed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors detail the experiments conducted. In **Section 4.1**, they specify the datasets used for the two problem domains:

1. **DIMACS Dataset**: This dataset is used for the graph coloring problem. The authors mention that they utilize benchmark graphs from this dataset.

2. **Schoenfield_Hard28 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for the bin packing problem, where each instance contains between 160 and 200 items.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DIMACS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David S Johnson and Michael A Trick. *Cliques, coloring, and satisfiability: second DIMACS implementation challenge, October 11-13, 1993*. Vol. 26. American Mathematical Soc., 1996.

- For the **Schoenfield_Hard28 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jon E Schoenfield. *Fast, exact solution of open bin packing problems without linear programming*. Draft, US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Huntsville, Alabama, USA, 2002.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application.
