To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does DQN really learn? Exploring adversarial training schemes in Pong" by Bowen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of agents trained using two self-play training schemes, Chainer and Pool, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the DQN and its performance in Atari games without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Gym Retro Atari implementation of Pong** as the environment for training their agents. However, this is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a framework for simulating the game.

I will then look into the **experiments** section to see if any datasets are referenced. The authors discuss the performance of their agents and the robustness of their training methods, but they do not mention any external datasets used for training or evaluation. Instead, they focus on the agents' performance against each other and the standard DQN agent.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references primarily cite foundational papers related to DQN and reinforcement learning, but they do not provide any dataset citations.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets used or referenced in this research. The focus is on the training methods and the performance of the agents in the Pong game environment, which is simulated rather than based on a dataset.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the training of agents in the Pong environment, it does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, there are no dataset citations to compile for this paper.
