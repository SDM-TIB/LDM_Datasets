To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing AI Algorithms for Optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography Parameters in E-Commerce Integrations: A Pre-Quantum Analysis" by Felipe Tellez and Jorge Ortiz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, which often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using a simulated e-commerce environment and refer to an "orders dataset" that includes invoices generated by an authorized online retailer. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **Results and Discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide further context on the datasets used in their experiments. However, the primary dataset appears to be the orders dataset mentioned earlier.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the orders dataset is cited as:
- "Online Retail," UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2015, https://doi.org/10.24432/C5BW33.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset properly.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
