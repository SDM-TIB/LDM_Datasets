To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach" by Sadek Belamfedel Alaoui and Adnane Saoud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not list datasets directly, it can hint at the types of experiments conducted.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two case studies: the **Mountain Car Control problem** and the **Van Der Pol Oscillator**. I will look for any specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these case studies.

In the **Mountain Car Control problem**, the authors refer to a discrete-time nonlinear system and mention that the control input is defined within a specific range. However, they do not cite a specific dataset but rather describe the system dynamics and the reward structure.

For the **Van Der Pol Oscillator**, the authors again describe the system dynamics and the control input but do not reference an external dataset. Instead, they provide a reward function that is used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any external datasets with citations, I will note that the experiments are based on simulations of these control problems rather than traditional datasets. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational papers or datasets are cited that could be relevant to the experiments. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of foundational works in reinforcement learning and control theory, rather than specific datasets.

In summary, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, it does describe two case studies that serve as the basis for the experiments. I will document these case studies as follows:

1. **Mountain Car Control Problem**: A discrete-time nonlinear system used for evaluating the proposed Q-learning approach.
   - Citation: Moore, A. W. (1990). Efficient memory-based learning for robot control. Tech. Rep., University of Cambridge.

2. **Van Der Pol Oscillator**: A control problem used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed symbolic Q-learning method.
   - No specific dataset citation, as the experiments are based on the system dynamics and reward structure.

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
