To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuroHex: A Deep Q-learning Hex Agent" by Kenny Young, Gautham Vasan, and Ryan Hayward, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their training process and any data used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the game of Hex and the challenges of applying deep Q-learning to it. They do not mention specific datasets here, so I will move on to the **methodology**.

In **section 2.4 (Position Database)**, the authors describe how they generated a database of starting positions from 10,000 games played by a variant of a strong hex-playing program called Wolve. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically:

1. **Position Database**: This dataset consists of starting positions generated from 10,000 games played by Wolve, which is used for supervised mentoring and to draw starting positions for self-play episodes.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wolve program, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used. The relevant citation is:

- For the Wolve program, the citation is:
  > Broderick Arneson, Ryan Hayward, and Philip Henderson. *Wolve wins hex tournament*. ICGA Journal, 2008.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Position Database**: A dataset of starting positions generated from 10,000 games played by a variant of the strong hex-playing program Wolve, used for supervised mentoring and self-play.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
