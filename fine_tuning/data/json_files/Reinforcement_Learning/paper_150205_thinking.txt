To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneously Updating All Persistence Values in Reinforcement Learning" by Luca Sabbioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluated their approach on **Atari games** and **tabular environments**. I will note these as they indicate the datasets or environments used for testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to established datasets, I will ensure to include the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment**, I will look for the citation:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

If they refer to specific tabular environments, I will look for citations related to those environments, such as:
> Biedenkapp, A., Rajan, R., Hutter, F., & Lindauer, M. T. (2021). TempoRL: Learning When to Act. In *ICML*.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their proper references for further exploration.
