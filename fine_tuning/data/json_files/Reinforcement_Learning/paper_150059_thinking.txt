To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Charging Scheduling Approach with Augmented Lagrangian for Electric Vehicle" by Guibin Chen and Xiaoying Shi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses optimizing charging schedules for electric vehicles (EVs) but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of EV charging and the need for real-world data to validate their approach. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their numerical experiments and mention using real-world electricity price data from the German day-ahead market on the European Power Exchange. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

The paper states that the electricity price data is hourly time-varying retail price, covering the period from October 1st, 2018, to May 1st, 2020. This dataset is essential for understanding the performance of their proposed algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the data source as "SMARD (2021), Market data. [Online] https://www.smard.de/home". This is the citation I need to include.

Additionally, the authors mention using a distribution pattern for EV user behavior, but they do not provide a specific dataset for this. Instead, they reference other studies for the distribution patterns, which may not be considered datasets in the same sense.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Electricity Price Data**: 
   - Description: Hourly time-varying retail price data from the German day-ahead market.
   - Time Period: October 1st, 2018, to May 1st, 2020.
   - Citation: 
     > SMARD (2021), Market data. [Online] https://www.smard.de/home

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
