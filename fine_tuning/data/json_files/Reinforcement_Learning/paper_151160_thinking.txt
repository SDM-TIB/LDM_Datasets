To extract datasets from the research paper titled "True Knowledge Comes from Practice: Aligning LLMs with Embodied Environments via Reinforcement Learning" by Weihao Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, TWOSOME, does not require any prepared datasets or prior knowledge of the environments, which suggests that the authors may not rely on traditional datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. The authors describe their evaluations on two environments: **Overcooked** and **VirtualHome**. However, they do not mention any specific datasets that are publicly available or commonly used in the literature. Instead, they indicate that their framework operates without the need for pre-collected datasets, which is a significant point of their contribution.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through discussions of previous studies. However, the focus remains on the methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper emphasizes that it does not utilize any datasets, I will confirm this by reviewing the **reproducibility statement** and **acknowledgments** sections. The authors reiterate that all experimental code and environment code are included in the supplementary materials, and they do not reference any external datasets.

Finally, I will compile the findings regarding the datasets. Since the paper does not provide any datasets or references to datasets, I will note that explicitly in my output.

In summary, the key points regarding datasets from this paper are:
- The authors do not use any prepared datasets.
- The experiments are conducted in the environments of Overcooked and VirtualHome, but these are not traditional datasets with citations.

Thus, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite from this paper.
