To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured agents for physical construction" by Victor Bapst et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "suite of challenging physical construction tasks," which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe various tasks (Silhouette, Connecting, Covering, and Covering Hard) but do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they seem to have created a simulated environment for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the datasets in this context refer to the generated tasks rather than traditional datasets from external sources.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will not need to look for references in the **References section**. Instead, I will summarize the constructed tasks as the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the constructed tasks as datasets:

1. **Silhouette Task**: A task where the agent must place blocks to overlap with target blocks in the scene while avoiding obstacles.

2. **Connecting Task**: A task where the agent must stack blocks to connect the floor to three different target locations while avoiding obstacles.

3. **Covering Task**: A task where the agent must build a shelter that covers all obstacles from above without touching them.

4. **Covering Hard Task**: A more complex version of the Covering task, where the agent has a limited supply of blocks and must plan carefully.

Since these tasks are not traditional datasets with citations, I will note that they are simulated environments created for the purpose of the study.

In conclusion, I will document the constructed tasks as datasets used in the experiments, emphasizing that they are not sourced from external datasets but are instead generated for the purpose of evaluating the proposed agents.
