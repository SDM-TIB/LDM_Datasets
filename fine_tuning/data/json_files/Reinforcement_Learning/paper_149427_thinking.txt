To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hindsight Goal Ranking on Replay Buffer for Sparse Reward Environment" by Tung M. Luu and Chang D. Yoo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its application, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may mention related works or benchmarks that could hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or benchmarks. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on robotic manipulation tasks, which may involve specific datasets or environments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to specific environments or datasets, such as "Fetch robotic-arm simulations" or any other benchmarks. The authors may also provide details about the tasks performed, which could indicate the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide proper attribution for each dataset. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets used in the experiments.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Fetch robotic-arm" environment, I will find the original source or documentation for this environment to cite it correctly. Similarly, if they refer to any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
