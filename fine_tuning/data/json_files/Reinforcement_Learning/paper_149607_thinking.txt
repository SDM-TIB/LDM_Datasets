To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Multi-Token Fairness in Text Classification" by Pranay Lohia, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their propositions on three widely used datasets in the area of fairness in text, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 7 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification**: This dataset consists of instances of 226,235 online comments that are manually labeled into various levels of toxicity. It is publicly available at Kaggle.

2. **IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled with binary sentiment (positive or negative) and is also publicly available at Kaggle.

3. **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,574 SMS messages tagged as either ham (legitimate) or spam, and it is available at Kaggle as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification** dataset, the citation is:
  > Daniel Borkan, Lucas Dixon, Jeffrey Sorensen, Nithum Thain, and Lucy Vasserman. *Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification*. In Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference, pages 491–500, 2019.

- For the **IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011.

- For the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tiago A Almeida, José María G Hidalgo, and Akebo Yamakami. *Contributions to the study of SMS spam filtering: new collection and results*. In Proceedings of the 11th ACM symposium on Document engineering, pages 259–262, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
