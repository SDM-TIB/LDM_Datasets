To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch-based 3D Natural Scene Generation from a Single Example" by Weiyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or types of scenes included.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they collected a variety of 3D scene models for their method, including rocks, plants, sculptures, landscapes, and artistic scenes. They also state that they rendered images from these models to create a Plenoxels-based exemplar pyramid. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in this section.

I will then check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets. The authors may have referenced other works that describe the datasets they used or similar datasets that are relevant to their research.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors have cited several 3D scene models from Sketchfab and other sources. I will extract the relevant citations for these datasets:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
