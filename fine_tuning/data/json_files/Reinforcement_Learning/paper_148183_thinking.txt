To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiplayer AlphaZero" by Nick Petosa and Tucker Balch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the AlphaZero algorithm in multiplayer environments but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the generality of AlphaZero and its application to various games, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Moving on to the **experiments and results** section, I will focus on the subsections that detail the experiments conducted. In **section 4.1 (Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe)**, the authors describe the game "Tic-Tac-Mo," which they created for their experiments. They mention that the game was trained using self-play, but they do not reference any external datasets.

In **section 4.2 (Multiplayer Connect 4)**, the authors introduce another game called "Connect 3x3." Similar to the previous section, they describe the game mechanics and training process but do not mention any datasets.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the AlphaZero algorithm in new game environments rather than on external datasets, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets cited in this paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to ensure that there are no overlooked datasets or external resources that might be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of works related to the AlphaZero algorithm and its predecessors, with no datasets explicitly mentioned.

In summary, this paper does not provide any datasets that require extraction or citation. Therefore, I will note that no datasets are available for this research paper.
