To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Q-learning for solving PDEs" by Samuel N. Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss numerical experiments or case studies, as these often include datasets that were used to validate the proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation for these datasets, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining accuracy and completeness in the citations provided.
