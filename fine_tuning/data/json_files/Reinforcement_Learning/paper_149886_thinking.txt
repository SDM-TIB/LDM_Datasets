To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bypass Network for Semantics Driven Image Paragraph Captioning" by Qi Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on a "widely used benchmark," which suggests that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Stanford image-paragraph dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and characteristics.

The paper states that the Stanford image-paragraph dataset contains **19,551 images** from the MS COCO dataset and Visual Genome, with each image labeled with a paragraph of about **67.50 words**. This dataset is divided into training, validation, and test splits, which is crucial information for understanding its structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford image-paragraph dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. IJCV, 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of related work or methodology. However, the primary dataset discussed appears to be the Stanford image-paragraph dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
