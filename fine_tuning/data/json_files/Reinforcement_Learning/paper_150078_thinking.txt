To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Encoder-Decoder Architecture with Top-Down Attention for Speech Separation" by Kai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method, TDANet, achieved competitive separation performance on three benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of speech separation but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 4 (Experiment Configurations)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Simulations)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Libri2Mix**: This dataset is derived from the LibriSpeech corpus and contains mixtures of speech from different speakers. The authors provide details about how the dataset was created, including the selection of speakers and the mixing process.

2. **WHAM!**: This dataset is described as a noisy version of the WSJ0-2Mix dataset, which includes speech mixed with various background noises. The authors explain the conditions under which the mixtures were created, including the signal-to-noise ratio.

3. **LRS2-2Mix**: This dataset is a newly created speech separation dataset based on the LRS2 corpus, which consists of video clips. The authors detail how they generated the mixtures and the characteristics of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Libri2Mix**, the citation is:
  > Joris Cosentino, Manuel Pariente, Samuele Cornell, Antoine Deleforge, and Emmanuel Vincent. *Librimix: an open-source dataset for generalizable speech separation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.11262, 2020.

- For **WHAM!**, the citation is:
  > Gordon Wichern, Joe Antognini, Michael Flynn, Licheng Richard Zhu, Emmett McQuinn, Dwight Crow, Ethan Manilow, and Jonathan Le Roux. *WHAM!: Extending Speech Separation to Noisy Environments*.

- For **LRS2-2Mix**, the citation is:
  > Triantafyllos Afouras, Joon Son Chung, Andrew Senior, Oriol Vinyals, and Andrew Zisserman. *Deep audio-visual speech recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
