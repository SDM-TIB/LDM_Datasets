To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brick Tic-Tac-Toe: Exploring the Generalizability of AlphaZero to Novel Test Environments" by John Tan Chong Min and Mehul Motani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it introduces the Brick Tic-Tac-Toe (BTTT) test bed, which is a key focus of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning environments but does not specify any datasets. 

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the BTTT environment. The paper describes the BTTT as a controlled environment for evaluating reinforcement learning methods, but it does not reference any external datasets. Instead, it focuses on the design and rules of the BTTT game itself.

In the **results section**, the paper presents findings from experiments conducted using the BTTT environment, but again, there are no external datasets mentioned. The results are based on the performance of various agents in the BTTT environment rather than on any pre-existing datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses the BTTT environment as a novel test bed for reinforcement learning rather than utilizing external datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, I will still check the **references section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of prior work or related studies. The references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and game theory, but they do not provide specific datasets.

In summary, this paper does not present any datasets that can be extracted. The focus is on the BTTT environment itself, which is a new test bed for evaluating the generalizability of reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
