To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path Planning for Cellular-Connected UAV: A DRL Solution with Quantum-Inspired Experience Replay" by Yuanjian Li, A. Hamid Aghvami, and Daoyi Dong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section often outlines the context of the research and may reference existing datasets that the authors have utilized or compared against.

I will then check the **methodology section** for any detailed descriptions of datasets used in the experiments. This section typically includes information about the data collection process, the characteristics of the datasets, and how they were used in the study.

If the paper has a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that to gather comprehensive details about each dataset, including its name, purpose, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
- Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are included and formatted correctly.
