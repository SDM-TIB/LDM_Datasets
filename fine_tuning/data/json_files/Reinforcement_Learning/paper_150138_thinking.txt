To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making a MIRACL: Multilingual Information Retrieval Across a Continuum of Languages" by Xinyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of the **MIRACL dataset**, which is a multilingual dataset designed for ad hoc retrieval across 18 different languages. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **dataset overview** section. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the MIRACL dataset, including the number of queries, relevance judgments, and the languages covered. They mention that the dataset includes over 700k relevance judgments for around 77k queries across Wikipedia in 18 languages, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In the **dataset construction** section, the authors describe the methodology used to create the dataset, including the hiring of native speakers for annotation and the process of generating queries and assessing relevance. This section reinforces the significance of the MIRACL dataset and provides context for its creation.

I will also check the **tables** and **figures** in the paper, particularly Table 1, which summarizes the descriptive statistics for each language included in the MIRACL dataset. This table provides additional details about the number of queries and judgments for each language, which is important for a complete understanding of the dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIRACL dataset. The authors reference the dataset in relation to the **Mr. TyDi** dataset and the **TyDi QA** dataset, which are foundational to the MIRACL dataset. I will ensure to include these citations as they are relevant to the dataset's lineage.

The full citation for the MIRACL dataset is as follows:
> Xinyu Zhang, Nandan Thakur, Odunayo Ogundepo, Ehsan Kamalloo, David Alfonso-Hermelo, Xiaoguang Li, Qun Liu, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Jimmy Lin. *Making a MIRACL: Multilingual Information Retrieval Across a Continuum of Languages*. In Proceedings of the WSDM 2023 Cup, 2023.

Now, I will compile the information about the MIRACL dataset, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review.
