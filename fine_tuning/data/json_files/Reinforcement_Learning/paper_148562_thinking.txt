To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Fundamentals of Experience Replay" by William Fedus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the analysis of experience replay in deep reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about experience replay but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention conducting experiments on the **Atari Arcade Learning Environment**. This is a significant clue that there are datasets involved, as the Atari games serve as the basis for their experiments.

In **Section A.2 (Atari 2600 games used)**, the authors list the specific games utilized in their experiments. The 14-game subset includes:

1. **AIR RAID**
2. **ASTERIX**
3. **BREAKOUT**
4. **FREEWAY**
5. **GRAVITAR**
6. **JAMES BOND**
7. **MONTEZUMA’S REVENGE**
8. **MS. PACMAN**
9. **PRIVATE EYE**
10. **Q*BERT**
11. **SEAQUEST**
12. **SPACE INVADERS**
13. **VENTURE**
14. **ZAXXON**

These games are part of the **Atari 2600** dataset, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the Atari dataset. The Atari 2600 games are referenced in the following paper:

- For the **Atari Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253–279.

Next, I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference previous works and datasets related to experience replay, but they primarily focus on the Atari dataset for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **Atari 2600 dataset**, with the following citation:
- Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253–279.

This process ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for datasets and documented them accurately with proper citations.
