To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Policy Distillation with Decision-Attention" by Xinqiang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly state the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of the **Atari game platform**, as the authors indicate that they conducted experiments using various reinforcement learning algorithms on this platform. I will check if they specify which Atari games were used as datasets for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari game platform**, I will note that the platform itself is a dataset for reinforcement learning experiments. The citation for the foundational work on DQN, which popularized the use of Atari games in reinforcement learning, is:

- **Atari Game Platform**: 
  > V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. Graves, I. Antonoglou, D. Wierstra, and M. Riedmiller. *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

If the paper mentions specific games like **Breakout** or **Space Invaders**, I will ensure to include those as well, along with their citations.

Finally, I will compile all identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in the research.
