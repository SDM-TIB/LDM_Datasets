To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Primal Wasserstein Imitation Learning" by Robert Dadashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading the entire paper, focusing on sections that typically mention datasets, such as the **Abstract**, **Introduction**, **Method**, and **Experiments** sections. These sections often provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation and experimentation.

2. **Identify Mentioned Datasets**: As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. For instance, in the **Experiments** section, the authors might describe the environments they tested their method on, which often includes specific datasets.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the **Experiments** section, the authors mention testing their method on six environments from the OpenAI Gym MuJoCo suite. I will look for details about these environments, including any specific datasets or benchmarks associated with them.

4. **Consult the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References** section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

5. **Extract Full Citations**: For each dataset identified, I will extract the full citation. For example, if the paper mentions the MuJoCo environments, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets.

6. **Compile the Information**: Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.

7. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review my findings to ensure that I have captured all datasets mentioned in the paper and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, along with the necessary citations for each dataset.
