To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Approach for Enhancing Spectral Efficiency of IRS-assisted Wireless Systems" by Farimehr Zohari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on spectral efficiency enhancement using deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in wireless communication but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **numerical results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This section discusses the performance of the proposed method but does not provide specific dataset names.

After that, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the study. The references include various works related to IRS and deep reinforcement learning, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that some of them may contain datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since no specific datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that the authors may have conducted simulations based on theoretical models rather than using publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

In summary, I will document my findings, noting that the paper does not specify any datasets used for experiments or simulations, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
