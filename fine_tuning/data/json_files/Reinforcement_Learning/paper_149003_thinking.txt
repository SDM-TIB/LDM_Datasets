To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Aware Lane Selection on Highway with Dynamic Obstacles" by Sangjae Bae et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the simulation setup and the traffic scenarios used for testing the proposed lane selection algorithm. This is where the authors are likely to detail the datasets or simulation environments they utilized.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any mention of specific datasets, such as traffic configurations, simulation environments, or any real-world data that may have been used. For instance, the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments, which is a crucial piece of information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or simulation environments mentioned. For example, the CARLA simulator is referenced, and I will need to extract its full citation.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, such as specific traffic data or models used in the simulations, I will ensure to extract their citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
