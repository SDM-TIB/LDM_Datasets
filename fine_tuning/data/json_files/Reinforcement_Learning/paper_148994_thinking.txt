To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The response of pre-osteoblasts and osteoclasts to gallium containing mesoporous bioactive glasses" by N. GÃ³mez-Cerezo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of specific datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures and any datasets used. I will look for any specific datasets related to the synthesis of mesoporous bioactive glasses, in vitro bioactivity tests, and cell culture experiments.

In the **results section**, I will identify any data presented in tables or figures that may correspond to datasets. This section often summarizes the findings and may include quantitative data that can be classified as datasets.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any references to previously published datasets or comparisons made with other studies. This could provide additional context or citations for the datasets mentioned.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the necessary information, including the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations. For example, if the paper mentions specific datasets related to the bioactivity tests or cell culture experiments, I will ensure to document those accurately.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to retrieve full citations for any datasets that are derived from other studies. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete understanding of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will organize the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
