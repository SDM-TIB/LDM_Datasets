To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning without Exploration" by Scott Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the introduction of a novel class of off-policy algorithms and mentions empirical demonstrations, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors detail their evaluation methods. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any named datasets or descriptions of the data collection process.

In the experiments section, the authors mention using various environments from OpenAI Gym, specifically referring to tasks such as **Hopper-v1**, **HalfCheetah-v1**, and **Walker2d-v1**. These are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather environments where the experiments are conducted. However, I need to check if they refer to any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **background and related work sections** for any references to datasets that might have been used in previous studies or benchmarks that the authors are building upon.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to retrieve the complete citation for each.

For the environments mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The general reference for the environments used in the experiments.
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

2. **MuJoCo**: If the authors mention using MuJoCo environments, I will also include this citation.
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026â€“5033.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for downstream processing or review.
