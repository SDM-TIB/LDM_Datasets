To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lamarckian Platform: Pushing the Boundaries of Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning towards Asynchronous Commercial Games" by Hui Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of the Lamarckian platform and its performance on benchmark tests, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe benchmark experiments conducted on various games, specifically mentioning the use of **Atari games** and **Google football**. This indicates that these games may serve as datasets for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experimental design and mention the environments used for testing. They specifically refer to the following environments:

1. **Atari Pendulum**: A classic control task used to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **Image Pong**: A variant of the Pong game used for testing.
3. **Vector Pong**: Another variant of Pong, likely with different input representations.
4. **Google Football**: A complex video game environment based on physics simulation.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the environments mentioned are as follows:

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > M. V. Mnih et al., "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning," arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

- For **Google Football**, the citation is:
  > K. Kurach et al., "Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment," in Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented and cited.
