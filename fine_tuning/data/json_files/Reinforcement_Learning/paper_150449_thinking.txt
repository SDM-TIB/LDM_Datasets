To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-Oriented Explainable Semantic Communication Based on Semantic Triplets" by Chuanhong Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed system is applied to sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **SST2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and is commonly referenced in the literature for evaluating sentiment classification models. It consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

2. **bAbI Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for question-answering tasks and consists of various subtasks designed to test different aspects of reasoning and comprehension.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SST2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (pp. 1631–1642).

- For the **bAbI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., Rush, A. M., van Merriënboer, B., Joulin, A., & Mikolov, T. (2015). *Towards AI-Complete Question Answering: A Set of Prerequisite Toy Tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.05698.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
