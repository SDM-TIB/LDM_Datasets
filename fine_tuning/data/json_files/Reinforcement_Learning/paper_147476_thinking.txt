To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Finite Time Analysis of Temporal Difference Learning With Linear Function Approximation" by Jalaj Bhandari, Daniel Russo, and Raghav Singal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets. This may provide additional context about the datasets and their significance in the research.

Once I have gathered information about the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact title or name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation, so that it can be easily referenced or accessed by others interested in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
