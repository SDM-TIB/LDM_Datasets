To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TaylorGAN: Neighbor-Augmented Policy Update for Sample-Efficient Natural Language Generation" by Chun-Hsing Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple metrics of quality and diversity, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the **EMNLP 2017 News dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing sentences with a maximum length of 50 tokens and a vocabulary of 5.3k words, with training and validation data consisting of 269k and 10k sentences, respectively. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Additionally, the authors reference the **COCO image caption dataset** in the same section, indicating that they performed additional experiments on this dataset. They mention that the COCO dataset consists of sentences with a maximum length of 24 tokens and a vocabulary of 4.6k words, with both training and validation data containing 10k sentences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **EMNLP 2017 News dataset**, the citation is:
> Caccia, M., Caccia, L., Fedus, W., Larochelle, H., Pineau, J., & Charlin, L. (2018). Language GANs falling short. *CoRR*, abs/1811.02549.

For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
> Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & Dollár, P. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, pages 740–755.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve creating a structured output that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
