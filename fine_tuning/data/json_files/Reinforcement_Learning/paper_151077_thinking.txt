To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active search and coverage using point-cloud reinforcement learning" by Matthias Rosynski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and the proposed solution, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss the context and may reference datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will have a specific section that outlines the datasets they used, including details about their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to simulators or datasets used for training or testing the reinforcement learning models. The authors mention a simulator developed for the experiments, which may imply the use of synthetic datasets generated from this simulator.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ShapeNet" or "ModelNet," I will look for the original papers that introduced these datasets to provide accurate citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract and document the datasets from the paper thoroughly and accurately.
