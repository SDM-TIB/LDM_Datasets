To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Elastic Step DQN: A novel multi-step algorithm to alleviate overestimation in Deep Q-Networks" by Adrian Ly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the empirical evaluation of the proposed method across several OpenAI Gym environments. This suggests that datasets related to these environments may be used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the environments used for testing. They mention three specific environments: **Cartpole**, **Mountain Car**, and **Acrobot**. These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized framework for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their methodology and the specific environments used, confirming that they utilized the OpenAI Gym environments for their experiments. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations for these environments, as they are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The OpenAI Gym environments are well-documented, and I can find authoritative citations for them. The relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Cartpole**: This is a classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. It is part of the OpenAI Gym.
2. **Mountain Car**: Another control problem where the objective is to drive a car up a hill. This environment is also included in the OpenAI Gym.
3. **Acrobot**: This environment involves controlling a two-link robot arm to swing up to a certain position. It is part of the OpenAI Gym as well.

Since these environments are standard benchmarks, they do not have separate dataset citations beyond the OpenAI Gym reference.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as it encompasses all three environments used in the experiments.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each entry is clearly documented with the appropriate citations.
