To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Effectiveness of Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms on the Batch Processing Problem" by Mohamed Z. Variawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors may discuss previous work and datasets used in related studies. This section often contains references to foundational datasets that inform the current research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets that were used for experiments or simulations. The authors may describe how they set up their simulations and whether they utilized any existing datasets or created new ones for their experiments.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors report any findings based on specific datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on particular data sources.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the batch processing problem and any surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from previous studies, I will ensure to capture those citations accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.
