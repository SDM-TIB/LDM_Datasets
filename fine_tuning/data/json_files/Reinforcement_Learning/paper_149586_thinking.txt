To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HC4: A New Suite of Test Collections for Ad Hoc CLIR" by Dawn Lawrie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that HC4 is a suite of test collections for Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) and mentions the types of documents and topics included, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the HC4 collections, which consist of documents from the Common Crawl in multiple languages (Chinese, Persian, and Russian) and include topics and relevance judgments.

In the **collection details section**, the authors provide specific statistics about the datasets, including the number of documents and topics for each language. This section confirms the existence of three distinct datasets:

1. **HC4 Chinese Dataset**: Contains approximately 646,305 documents and 50 topics.
2. **HC4 Persian Dataset**: Contains approximately 486,486 documents and 50 topics.
3. **HC4 Russian Dataset**: Contains approximately 4,721,064 documents and 50 topics.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are part of the HC4 collection and are not attributed to separate papers, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The full citation for the HC4 dataset is:
> Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, Douglas W. Oard, and Eugene Yang. *HC4: A New Suite of Test Collections for Ad Hoc CLIR*. In Proceedings of the 44th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR), 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the HC4 dataset in each entry. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to use these datasets in their research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
