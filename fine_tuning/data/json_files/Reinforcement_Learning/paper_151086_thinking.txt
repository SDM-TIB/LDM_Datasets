To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Knowledge-Free Deep Learning for General Game Playing" by Michał Maras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for dataset generation, which indicates that there may be specific datasets related to the games being played.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any specific datasets or game environments they used for their experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the theoretical framework and does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details on how the datasets were generated. The authors mention that the training dataset is generated by playing games using standard UCT MCTS agents, but they do not specify any named datasets here.

In the **experiments section**, I will examine the tables presented, particularly **Table 1** and **Table 2**, which provide results of the neural network agents against a baseline. These tables include various games such as Breakthrough, English Draughts, and Reversi, along with the sizes of the datasets used for training. However, the paper does not provide formal names for these datasets, as they are generated from the gameplay of these specific games.

To ensure I have all relevant information, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might relate to the datasets or methodologies used. The references primarily cite foundational works in AI and game playing but do not provide specific dataset citations.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will summarize the datasets based on the games mentioned and their respective dataset sizes:

1. **Breakthrough (6 × 6)**: Dataset size of 200 MCTS plays.
2. **English Draughts**: Dataset size of 400 MCTS plays.
3. **Reversi**: Dataset size of 1,000 MCTS plays.

While I cannot provide formal citations for these datasets as they are not explicitly named in the paper, I will note that they are derived from the gameplay of the respective games mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of the datasets, even though formal citations are not available. This will include the game names, dataset sizes, and the context in which they were generated.
