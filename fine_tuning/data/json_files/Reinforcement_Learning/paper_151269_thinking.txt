To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Probing the Information Encoded in Neural-based Acoustic Models of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems" by Quentin Raymondaud et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Probing Tasks)**, where the authors describe the different tasks and the datasets used for each task. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets.

1. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the speaker verification task. The authors mention that it contains speech from 5,994 speakers and that the system is evaluated on the VoxCeleb1-E Cleaned dataset, which involves 579,818 trials.

2. **UrbanSound8k Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the acoustic environments task. It contains 8,732 sounds divided into 10 classes, and the authors reference using a recipe from Speechbrain for training.

3. **Voxceleb1 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating the speaking rate and speaker gender tasks. It contains 153,516 utterances and is used alongside the VoxCeleb2 dataset for training.

4. **Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD)**: This dataset is used for the speech sentiment and emotion recognition tasks. It consists of 13,000 utterances from the Friends TV show, annotated for sentiment and emotion.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. In Interspeech, 2018.

- For **Voxceleb1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In Interspeech, 2017.

- For **UrbanSound8k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Salamon, C. Jacoby, and J. P. Bello. *A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research*. In International Conference on Multimedia (ACM), 2014.

- For **Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD)**, the citation is:
  > S. Poria, D. Hazarika, N. Majumder, G. Naik, E. Cambria, and R. Mihalcea. *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
