To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Reinforcement Learning (Not) for Natural Language Processing: Benchmarks, Baselines, and Building Blocks for Natural Language Policy Optimization" by Prithviraj Ammanabrolu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the **experiments section** provides a table (Table 1) that lists the tasks and corresponding datasets used for evaluation. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: Used for text continuation tasks, consisting of movie reviews with sentiment labels.
2. **CommonGen Dataset**: A dataset for generative commonsense reasoning, where the task is to generate coherent sentences using a set of input concepts.
3. **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: Used for summarization tasks, containing news articles and their highlights.
4. **ToTTo Dataset**: A controlled table-to-text generation dataset where the goal is to produce one-sentence descriptions of highlighted table cells.
5. **NarrativeQA Dataset**: A dataset for question answering based on narrative texts.
6. **WMT-16 Dataset**: A machine translation dataset for translating between English and German.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and can typically be found in the references of the paper. 

For example, the citation for the **IMDB dataset** is:
> Maas, A., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142-150).

The citation for the **CommonGen dataset** is:
> Lin, B., Zhou, W., Shen, M., & Choi, Y. (2020). CommonGen: A constrained text generation challenge for generative commonsense reasoning. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020 (pp. 1823-1840).

The citation for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** is:

The citation for the **ToTTo dataset** is:
> Parikh, A., Tandon, N., Das, D., & Choi, Y. (2020). ToTTo: A controlled table-to-text generation dataset. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) (pp. 1173-1186).

The citation for the **NarrativeQA dataset** is:
> Kocisky, T., Schwarz, J., Blunsom, P., Dyer, C., Hermann, K. M., & Grefenstette, E. (2018). The narrativeqa reading comprehension challenge. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6, 317-328.

The citation for the **WMT-16 dataset** is:
> Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Graham, Y., Haddow, B., Huck, M., ... & Zampieri, M. (2016). Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation: Volume 2, Shared Task Papers (pp. 131-198).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
