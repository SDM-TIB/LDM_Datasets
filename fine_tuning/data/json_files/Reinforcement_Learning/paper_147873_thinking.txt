To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distillation Strategies for Proximal Policy Optimization" by Sam Green et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation details and results sections**. These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** for their experiments, which is a crucial dataset for reinforcement learning tasks.

In the **implementation details section**, I will look for any specific environments or datasets that were utilized. The authors mention that they trained agents on **10 different Atari environments**, which are part of the Arcade Learning Environment. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, each corresponding to a different Atari game.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This is a well-known benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. **Atari Games**: While the paper does not provide individual citations for each Atari game, they are part of the Arcade Learning Environment. The games mentioned include Beamrider, Breakout, Enduro, Freeway, Ms. Pacman, Pong, Q*bert, Riverraid, Seaquest, and Space Invaders. The citation for the Atari games can be referenced from the Arcade Learning Environment citation.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the datasets and their citations. I will then prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- Arcade Learning Environment (including various Atari games) with the citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately from the research paper.
