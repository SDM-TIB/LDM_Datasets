To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimised Playout Implementations for the Ludii General Game System" by Dennis J. N. J. Soemers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses optimised implementations, it does not directly mention datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 8) where the authors evaluate their proposed implementations. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for empirical evaluation. I will look for any references to specific datasets or game collections that were tested.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluated their implementations across **145 different games** in the Ludii system. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name but rather refer to the games available in the Ludii general game system. This indicates that the dataset consists of various games rather than a single dataset.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the Ludii system or the games mentioned. The authors reference several works that describe the Ludii system and its capabilities, which may serve as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The relevant citation for the Ludii general game system is:
> Browne, C., Stephenson, M., Piette, Ã‰., Soemers, D.J.N.J. (2020). *A practical introduction to the Ludii general game system*. In: Cazenave, T., van den Herik, J., Saffidine, A., Wu, I.C. (eds.) Adv. in Computer Games. ACG 2019. LNCS, vol. 12516. Springer, Cham.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets but rather refers to the collection of games within the Ludii system, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Ludii General Game System Dataset**: This dataset includes a collection of 145 different games with various rulesets that were used for empirical evaluation of the proposed playout implementations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for anyone reviewing the datasets used in this research.
