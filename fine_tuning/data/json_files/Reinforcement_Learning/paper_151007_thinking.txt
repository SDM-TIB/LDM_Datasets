To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-intention Inverse Q-learning for Interpretable Behavior Representation" by Hao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to "several real animal behavior datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments and discussion)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used for evaluation. 

Upon reviewing section 5, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Mice Navigation Dataset**: This dataset was collected from a 127-node labyrinth navigation task, originally reported by Rosenberg et al. (2021). It includes trajectories from mice navigating the labyrinth under different conditions (water-restricted and water-unrestricted).

2. **Mice Reversal-Learning Dataset**: This dataset was collected from a cohort of mice engaged in a dynamic two-armed bandit reversal-learning task, as reported by De La Crompe et al. (2023). It consists of multiple sessions of trials where mice choose between two options for rewards.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Mice Navigation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthew Rosenberg, Tony Zhang, Pietro Perona, and Markus Meister. *Mice in a labyrinth show rapid learning, sudden insight, and efficient exploration*. Elife, 10:e66175, 2021.

- For the **Mice Reversal-Learning Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brice De La Crompe, Megan Schneck, Florian Steenbergen, Artur Schneider, and Ilka Diester. *FreiBox: A versatile open-source behavioral setup for investigating the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility via 1-photon imaging in freely moving mice*. Eneuro, 10(4), 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Mice Navigation Dataset**: Collected from a 127-node labyrinth navigation task, this dataset includes trajectories of mice under different conditions.
   - Citation: Rosenberg et al. (2021).

2. **Mice Reversal-Learning Dataset**: Collected from a dynamic two-armed bandit reversal-learning task, this dataset consists of multiple sessions of trials from mice.
   - Citation: De La Crompe et al. (2023).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
