To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex Q Learning in a Stochastic Environment: Extended Version" by Fan Lu and Sean Meyn, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or theoretical analysis. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which appears to be section 5 in this paper) to identify any datasets used in the experiments. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. 

Upon reviewing section 5, I find that the authors discuss an application to a classical inventory control problem but do not specify any datasets directly. Instead, they describe the modeling assumptions and the theoretical framework without referencing specific datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the experiments section, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. This could include datasets used in previous studies that the authors reference. 

In the references, I will look for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the research context. For example, if the authors cite foundational works in reinforcement learning or specific datasets used in prior research, I will note those.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper and references, I conclude that there are no specific datasets mentioned in this paper. However, I will still compile a list of relevant citations from the references that could be useful for future research or context:

1. For the foundational work on Q-learning:
   > Watkins, C. J. C. H. (1989). *Learning from Delayed Rewards*. PhD thesis, Kingâ€™s College, Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

2. For the linear programming approach to optimal control:
   > Manne, A. S. (1960). Linear programming and sequential decisions. *Management Science*, 6(3), 259-267.

3. For the logistic Q-learning approach:
   > Bas Serrano, J., Curi, S., Krause, A., & Neu, G. (2021). Logistic Q-learning. In A. Banerjee & K. Fukumizu (Eds.), *Proceedings of The Intl. Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics* (Vol. 130, pp. 3610-3618).

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will summarize my findings and ensure that I have noted the relevant citations for any foundational works that could be related to datasets in the field of reinforcement learning.

Finally, I will prepare to present this information in a structured format, ensuring that all citations are complete and properly formatted for future reference.
