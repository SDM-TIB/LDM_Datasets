To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trajectory-guided Control Prediction for End-to-end Autonomous Driving: A Simple yet Strong Baseline" by Penghao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for data collection. They state that they generated random routes under various weather conditions, collecting a total of **420,000 data samples** across **eight public towns** offered by the CARLA simulator. This indicates that the CARLA dataset is a significant part of their research.

I will also check the **supplementary materials** for any additional details about the dataset collection process and statistics. The supplementary document provides a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of samples and the characteristics of each town used for training and testing.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset was collected using the CARLA simulator, which is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. The authors used an expert model named Roach to collect data, generating random routes with varying lengths and conditions.

Next, I will find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The relevant citation from the references section is:

- For the CARLA simulator:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., LÃ³pez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In *CoRL*.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the dataset details and their citations, ready to format them according to the required structure for further processing.
