To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Based Radiomics for Glial Tumor Classification and Comparison with Volumetric Analysis" by Sevcan Turk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of machine learning and radiomics in analyzing MRI features for tumor classification. They mention the study's focus on glioma patients, which suggests that patient data is a key component of the research.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the data collection process. The authors state that they retrospectively studied **57 glioma patients** with various MRI scans, including pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR images, and ADC maps. This indicates that the dataset consists of MRI images from these patients.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the analysis of these datasets, including comparisons of volume ratios and classification accuracies. They provide specific metrics related to the performance of machine learning models, which further confirms the use of the MRI datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own study of glioma patients, there may not be external citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, I will note the details of the patient cohort and the types of MRI scans used.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **Glioma Patient Dataset**: This dataset includes MRI scans (pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR images, and ADC maps) from **57 glioma patients** categorized into grade II, III, and IV tumors.

Since the dataset is based on the authors' own research, I will create a citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the **Glioma Patient Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sevcan Turk, Kaya Oguz, Mehmet Orman, Emre Caliskan, Yesim Ertan, Erkin Ozgiray, Taner Akalin, Ashok Srinivasan, Omer Kitis. *Machine Learning Based Radiomics for Glial Tumor Classification and Comparison with Volumetric Analysis*. [Journal Name], [Volume], [Page Numbers], [Year].

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
