To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Fairness-Aware Spectrum Auction for Enhanced Licensed Shared Access in 6G Networks" by Mina Khadem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This is often where researchers detail the data they utilized to validate their findings.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial because the authors may refer to datasets without providing complete citations in the main text.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of simulation results, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they reference their own simulations based on theoretical models and algorithms. Therefore, I will note that while there are no external datasets cited, the authors have created their own simulation data based on their proposed methods.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with citations, I will summarize the findings regarding the data used in the research:

1. **Simulation Data**: The authors conducted simulations based on their proposed auction mechanisms and algorithms, specifically the fair Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (FVCG) auction and the market share-based weighted greedy algorithm (MSWGA). They do not reference any external datasets but instead rely on their own generated data for analysis.

2. **Parameter Settings**: The paper includes a detailed description of the parameters used in the simulations, such as the number of mobile network operators (MNOs), bandwidth, and sensing thresholds, which are essential for replicating the study.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will conclude that the research relies on simulation data generated by the authors, and I will note that no specific datasets were referenced in the paper.

In summary, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations (or lack thereof) into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
