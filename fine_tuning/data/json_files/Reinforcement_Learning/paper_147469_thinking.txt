To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smoothed Action Value Functions for Learning Gaussian Policies" by Ofir Nachum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any section that discusses the methodology or experimental setup, as this is where datasets are typically detailed.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of any standard benchmarks or datasets used for evaluation, particularly in sections that discuss experiments or results. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or specific characteristics.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "OpenAI Gym" for their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
