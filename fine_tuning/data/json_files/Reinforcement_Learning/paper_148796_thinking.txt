To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Realistic Limit Order Book Market Simulation" by MichaÃ«l Karpe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of NASDAQ high-frequency limit order book (LOB) data, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used NASDAQ data converted to LOBSTER format for their experiments. They specify that the data includes order flow for five stocks (CSCO, IBM, INTC, MSFT, and YHOO) from January 13 to February 6, 2003. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LOBSTER dataset mentioned. The authors reference the LOBSTER system in the following citation:

- For the LOBSTER dataset, the citation is:
  > Ruihong Huang and Tomas Polak. *LOBSTER: Limit order book reconstruction system*. Available at SSRN 1977207, 2011.

Additionally, I will ensure that I note the specific stocks and the time period for which the data was collected, as this information is crucial for a comprehensive dataset description.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future reference or analysis.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Identify the datasets in the experiments section, focusing on section 4.1.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
4. Document the datasets with all relevant details, including names, descriptions, and citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in this research paper.
