It consists of 40 real-life surveillance scenes, including various types of spoofing attacks such as high-fidelity masks, 2D attacks, and adversarial attacks. The dataset includes images from 101 participants performing natural activities under diverse outdoor conditions, capturing a range of weather and lighting situations. It is partitioned into three subsets: train, dev, and test, with quality scores assigned to images based on their clarity.",
