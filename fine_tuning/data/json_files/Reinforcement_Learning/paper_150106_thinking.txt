To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration Policies for On-the-Fly Controller Synthesis: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Tomás Delgado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention a benchmark introduced by Ciolek et al. (2020) that contains six control problem domains: Air Traffic (AT), Bidding Workflow (BW), Travel Agency (TA), Transfer Line (TL), Dining Philosophers (DP), and Cat and Mouse (CM). I will note these domains as they represent the datasets used for evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the benchmark paper by Ciolek et al. (2020) will need to be cited properly.

The citation for the benchmark paper is:
> Ciolek, D. A.; Braberman, V.; D’Ippolito, N.; Sardiña, S.; and Uchitel, S. 2020. Compositional Supervisory Control via Reactive Synthesis and Automated Planning. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 65(8): 3502–3516.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the names of the datasets, their purposes, and the full citations for any papers that describe them in detail.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
