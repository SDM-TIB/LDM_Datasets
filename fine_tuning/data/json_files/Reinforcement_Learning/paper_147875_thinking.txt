To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Shaping via Meta-Learning" by Haosheng Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which can guide me in identifying relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they are used.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CartPole** task and **grid games**. I will note these as they are likely to be the datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper references foundational works that describe the environments used:

1. For the **CartPole** environment, the citation is:
   > Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., and Anderson, C. W. "Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems." *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics*, 1983.

2. For the **OpenAI Gym**, which includes the CartPole environment, the citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." *2016*.

3. The authors also reference the **grid games** as a general environment for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific citation for a dataset. Instead, they describe the generation of grid maps for their experiments, which may not have a formal citation but is based on their own implementation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
