To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic control of self-assembly of quasicrystalline structures through reinforcement learning" by Uyen Tu Lieu and Natsuhiko Yoshinaga, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets or experimental setups.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their research. This section often contains background information that can lead to the identification of datasets used in the study.

I will then examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or simulations. Here, the authors may describe the datasets they used for training their reinforcement learning models or for validating their results.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments or analyses. The authors may provide details about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Based on the content of the paper, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly to ensure that each dataset is well-documented and easily accessible for future reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not overlook any important datasets or details in the paper.
