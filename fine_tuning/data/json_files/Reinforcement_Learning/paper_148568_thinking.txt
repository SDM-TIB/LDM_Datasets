To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning with an Objective Discovered Online" by Zhongwen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment** for their experiments. This is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning research, and I will need to ensure I capture the full citation for this dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the Atari Learning Environment. The citation is as follows:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: A benchmark platform for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, consisting of various classic Atari games. It provides a diverse set of environments for training and testing RL agents.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the dataset citation is included for future use.
