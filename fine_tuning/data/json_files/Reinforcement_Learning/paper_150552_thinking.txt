To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Risk-Averse Q-Learning with Streaming Observations" by Yuhao Wang and Enlu Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any named datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any descriptions of their size, type, and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to any datasets by name, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "Coin Toss" and "Inventory Management," I will look for their respective citations in the references. If the datasets are derived from other works, I will ensure to cite the original sources accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
