To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on Native American English Speech Recognition by Indian Listeners with Varying Word Familiarity Level" by Abhayjeet Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves TIMIT utterances, which suggests that the TIMIT dataset is a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials Used in Study section**. Here, the authors mention that they selected **500 TIMIT sentences** for their study, which were recognized by **500 Indian listeners**. This confirms that the TIMIT dataset is indeed used in the research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **American National Corpus (ANC) frequency dataset** as a tool for categorizing the TIMIT sentences based on word familiarity. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the sentences were selected and categorized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
   > L. D. Consortium et al., “The DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus,” NIST Speech CD, pp. 1–1, 1990.

2. For the **American National Corpus (ANC) frequency dataset**, the citation is:
   > “American National Corpus, Second Release, Frequency Data, last accessed: 29/03/2021.” [Online]. Available: https://www.anc.org/data/anc-second-release/frequency-data/

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for clarity and proper attribution. This will facilitate further analysis or processing of the datasets mentioned in the research paper.
