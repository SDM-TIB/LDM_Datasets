To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Allocation in Submarine Armored Three-core HVAC Power Cables" by Juan Carlos del-Pino-López et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setups and any datasets used for analysis. I will look for mentions of specific datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The results section may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors present comparative analyses or findings based on specific datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention analyzing a set of **368 three-core armored cable configurations** and a second set of **645 armored cables**. These configurations are crucial datasets for the study, as they form the basis for the analytical expressions and improvements proposed by the authors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the datasets are derived from the authors' own experimental setups and analyses, so I will note that the datasets are not from external sources but are original contributions of the authors.

The relevant datasets I will extract are:

1. **368 three-core armored cable configurations**: This dataset is used to derive new analytical expressions for loss estimation.
2. **645 armored cables**: This dataset is used to validate the proposed improvements in loss estimation.

Since these datasets are original and do not have external citations, I will note them as follows:

- For the **368 three-core armored cable configurations**, I will cite it as:
  > Juan Carlos del-Pino-López, Pedro Cruz-Romero, and Luis Carlos Sánchez-Díaz. *Loss Allocation in Submarine Armored Three-core HVAC Power Cables*. In Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2020 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe (EEEIC/I&CPS Europe), Madrid, Spain, June 2020.

- For the **645 armored cables**, I will use the same citation as above since it is part of the same study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
