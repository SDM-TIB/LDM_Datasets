To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sparse Representations Incrementally in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia and Richard S. Sutton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods in "two different benchmark domains," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **Mountain Car** and **4D Catcher** environments as benchmark domains for their experiments. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their research.

I will then look for any additional details about these environments in the paper. The authors describe the **Mountain Car** environment as a classic reinforcement learning problem where an agent must learn to drive a car up a hill, and the **4D Catcher** environment involves catching falling objects in a four-dimensional space. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for these environments, as they are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

Since these environments are widely recognized, I will reference their original sources to provide proper citations. The citations for these environments are as follows:

- For the **Mountain Car** environment, the citation is:
  > Sutton, R. S. (1988). Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences. *Machine Learning*, 3(1), 9â€“44.

- For the **4D Catcher** environment, the citation is:
  > This environment is often associated with various implementations in reinforcement learning frameworks, but a specific citation is not provided in the paper. However, it is commonly referenced in the context of reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
