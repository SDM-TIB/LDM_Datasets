To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Deep Q-Network with Multiclass Classification Algorithms" by Noopur Zambare and Ravindranath Sawane, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using a **benchmark dataset from Kaggle**, which indicates that a specific dataset is involved, but I need to find more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Deep Q-Network (DQN) for predicting financial distress, but they do not specify the dataset here. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they explicitly mention the dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset gathered from Kaggle, which includes various financial parameters and company characteristics. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset. I will note that it is a Kaggle dataset in CSV format, but I need to find the exact title or link to the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that might lead to the dataset. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Kaggle dataset, I will need to search Kaggle directly for datasets related to financial distress prediction to find the most relevant one.

After identifying the dataset, I will ensure to document the full citation for it. If the dataset is publicly available on Kaggle, I will include the URL as part of the citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Kaggle dataset once I have confirmed its details.

In summary, my steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify the dataset described in section 3.1.
3. Search Kaggle for the specific dataset related to financial distress prediction.
4. Document the full citation for the dataset, including the URL if applicable.
5. Compile the dataset information for structured output.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in this research paper.
