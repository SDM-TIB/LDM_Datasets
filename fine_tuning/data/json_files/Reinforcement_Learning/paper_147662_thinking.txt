To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-Appreciated Rewards" by Ofir Nachum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on a set of algorithmic tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of reinforcement learning and mentions algorithmic tasks, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section 6 (Six Algorithmic Tasks)**, where the authors describe the tasks used for evaluation. Here, they list several tasks, including:

1. **Copy**: The agent should emit a copy of the sequence.
2. **DuplicatedInput**: The agent must deduplicate the sequence.
3. **RepeatCopy**: The agent should emit the hidden sequence and then emit it in reverse.
4. **Reverse**: The agent emits the hidden sequence in reverse order.
5. **ReversedAddition**: The agent must emit the sum of two numbers represented in a hidden tape.
6. **BinarySearch**: The agent must find a query number in a hidden array.

These tasks are implemented using the OpenAI Gym environment, which indicates that the datasets are likely derived from this framework.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or tasks mentioned. The paper references the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will use this citation to represent the datasets associated with these tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

1. **Copy Task**: 
   - Dataset: OpenAI Gym environment for the Copy task.

   - Citation: Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
