To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistent Counterfactuals by Latent Transformations" by Saeed Khorram and Li Fuxin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "ImageNet" and "MNIST" datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments. I will note these names for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention using the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets for their experiments. They describe the MNIST dataset as containing images of handwritten digits and the Fashion-MNIST dataset as a collection of fashion items, both with specific resolutions and class distributions.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Based on the information provided in the paper, I can gather the following citations:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." 2017.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of **ImageNet** in section 4.1, specifically in the context of high-resolution images generated by BigGAN. I will also look for its citation in the references section:

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In *2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations for future use or analysis.
