To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robotic Lever Manipulation using Hindsight Experience Replay and Shapley Additive Explanations" by Sindre Benjamin Remman and Anastasios M. Lekkas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection. The introduction discusses the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and mentions various applications, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the experimental setup, including the use of the OpenMANIPULATOR-X robotic manipulator and the simulators (PyBullet and Gazebo). I will look for any specific datasets or environments mentioned that were used for training or testing the robotic manipulator.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets or environments.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the authors mention using the PyBullet simulator, I will look for the citation that describes this simulator. Similarly, if they refer to any specific datasets related to robotic manipulation or reinforcement learning, I will find their respective citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing.
