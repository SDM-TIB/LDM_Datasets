To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Uncertainty of Loss Landscape for Stochastic Optimization" by Vineeth S. Bhaskara and Sneha Desai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. They mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** for training various neural network architectures. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding the datasets, such as specific configurations or preprocessing steps. However, the main datasets are already identified in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets identified from the paper are:
- **MNIST Dataset**: Used for training logistic regression and MLP models.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Used for training CNN models.

I will compile this information into the required structured format for further processing.
