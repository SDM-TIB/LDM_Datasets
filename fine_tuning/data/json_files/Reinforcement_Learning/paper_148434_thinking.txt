To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Yseop at SemEval-2020 Task 5: Cascaded BERT Language Model for Counterfactual Statement Analysis" by Hanna Abi Akl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks and methods used, and the introduction sets the context for the research, which may include references to datasets.

In **section 3 (Dataset)**, the authors state that the datasets used are those provided by the shared task organizers and reference (Yang et al., 2020) for the data description. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with the SemEval-2020 Task 5.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The reference to (Yang et al., 2020) is crucial, as it will provide the necessary details about the dataset used in the experiments.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Yang, Xiaoyu, Obadinma, Stephen, Zhao, Huasha, Zhang, Qiong, Matwin, Stan, and Zhu, Xiaodan. 2020. SemEval-2020 Task 5: Counterfactual Recognition. Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020).

Since the paper indicates that no additional data was used beyond what was provided by the task organizers, I will only include this dataset in my extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing needed.
