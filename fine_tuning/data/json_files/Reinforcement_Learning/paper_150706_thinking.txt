To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for ESG financial portfolio management" by Eduardo C. Garrido-Merch√°n et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym and the FinRL platform, which suggests that these platforms may contain datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of financial data from Yahoo Finance and ESG information from Bloomberg. This indicates that these sources are integral to their research.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **state space** and **reward function** descriptions. The authors mention using daily financial data from 2009-01-01 to 2021-10-31, which is crucial for understanding the temporal aspect of the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or sources mentioned. The paper references various studies and sources that may provide additional context or datasets related to ESG investing and financial portfolio management.

1. **Yahoo Finance API**: The authors used this API to download daily financial data from 2009-01-01 to 2021-10-31. The citation for this source is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is a well-known financial data provider.

2. **Bloomberg ESG Information**: The authors mention using monthly ESG information from Bloomberg. Again, while a specific citation is not provided, Bloomberg is a recognized source for ESG data.

3. **FinRL Platform**: The paper references the FinRL platform, which is a framework for deep reinforcement learning in finance. The citation for this platform is not included in the paper, but it can be found through its official documentation or repository.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or source mentioned, even if they are not explicitly cited in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
