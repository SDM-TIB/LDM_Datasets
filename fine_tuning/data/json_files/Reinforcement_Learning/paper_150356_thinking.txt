To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Scale-Independent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Convergence Analysis" by Mohsen Amidzadeh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the methodology and datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss a multi-task problem related to edge caching for cellular networks. They mention that the experiments are based on a system model presented in a previous work by Amidzadeh et al. (2021). This indicates that I should look for the specific datasets or models referenced in that work.

In section 5.1, the authors describe the environment of the multi-task problem, mentioning the use of **Poisson point processes** to model the location of users and base-stations. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset but refer to a system model from a previous paper. Therefore, I will need to check the reference for Amidzadeh et al. (2021) to see if it includes a dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the work by Amidzadeh et al. (2021) mentioned in the experiments:

- For **Amidzadeh et al. (2021)**, the citation is:
  > Mohsen Amidzadeh, Hanan Al-Tous, Olav Tirkkonen, and Junshan Zhang. *Joint cache placement and delivery design using reinforcement learning for cellular networks*. In IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, pp. 1â€“6, 2021. doi: 10.1109/VTC2021-Spring51267.2021.9448674.

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets beyond this reference, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is derived from the work cited above.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
