To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Fusion for Sensorimotor Coordination in Steering Angle Prediction" by Farzeen Munir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on their own collected dataset, the Davis Driving dataset (DDD), and the Carla Eventscape dataset. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Our Collected Dataset**: This dataset includes event data, frame-based RGB data, and vehicle control data collected using various sensors. The authors describe the data collection process, including the types of sensors used and the synchronization method. 

2. **Davis Driving Dataset (DDD)**: This dataset is described as one of the most extensive datasets collected using a DAVIS camera, providing a concurrent stream of events and standard grayscale images. The authors mention the size of the dataset and the conditions under which it was collected.

3. **EventScape Dataset**: This dataset is noted as a large-scale synthetic dataset recorded through the CARLA simulator, which includes event camera data and frame-based RGB images. The authors provide details about the data collection conditions and the size of the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Davis Driving Dataset (DDD)**, the citation is:

- For **EventScape Dataset**, the citation is:

- The citation for **our collected dataset** is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned that the data collection process and synchronization code are open-sourced, which can be referenced as:
  > Munir, F., Azam, S., Jeon, M., & Lee, B.-G. (2021). Multi-Modal Fusion for Sensorimotor Coordination in Steering Angle Prediction. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
