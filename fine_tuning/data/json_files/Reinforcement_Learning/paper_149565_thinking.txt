To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CausalKG: Causal Knowledge Graph" by Utkarshani Jaimini and Amit Sheth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss the Causal Knowledge Graph (CausalKG) and its applications, particularly in the context of autonomous driving. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of an **autonomous driving dataset** for estimating causal effects in their causal Bayesian network. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the main text. I will need to check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that might refer to datasets used in their research.

In the references, I will look for any papers or sources that describe datasets related to autonomous driving or causal inference. If the authors have cited foundational works or datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if I find a reference to a commonly used dataset in autonomous driving, such as the **KITTI dataset**, I will note its citation:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

If the paper mentions any other datasets, I will follow the same process to extract their names and full citations.

Finally, I will compile all identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations for future use or verification.
