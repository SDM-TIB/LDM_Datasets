To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Sensitive Compact Decision Trees for Autonomous Execution in Presence of Simulated Market Response" by Svitlana Vyetrenko and Shaojie Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their **market simulator** and the **data used for training the trading agent**. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets, including any historical data or market data utilized in their experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used to validate their findings or to compare their approach against benchmarks. This could include references to specific datasets or sources of data.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same data.

From my reading, I expect to find at least two datasets:

1. **Historical Limit Order Book (LOB) Data**: This dataset is likely used to train the trading agent and simulate market responses. The authors may refer to specific sources or exchanges that provide this data.

2. **Completed Trade Data**: This dataset is probably used alongside the LOB data to evaluate the performance of the trading strategies developed in the paper.

Once I have identified these datasets, I will compile their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset from a well-known exchange or a publicly available dataset, I will ensure to include the complete citation as follows:

- For the **Historical Limit Order Book Data**, if it is sourced from a specific exchange, I will cite it as:
  > [Author(s)]. *Title of the Dataset*. [Publisher/Source], [Year]. URL (if applicable).

- For the **Completed Trade Data**, if it is publicly available or from a specific study, I will cite it similarly.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis. This systematic approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
