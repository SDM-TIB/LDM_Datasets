To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Informational Denial-of-Service (IDoS) Attacks: Modeling and Mitigation of Attentional Human Vulnerability" by Linan Huang and Quanyan Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to look for specific mentions of datasets. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the paper includes a **results section**, I will also check there for any additional context regarding the datasets.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source information for anyone who may want to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Cyber Attack Dataset" or "Human Attention Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly according to the relevant academic standards, as this is essential for proper attribution and academic integrity.
