To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Logarithmic Barrier Method For Proximal Policy Optimization" by Cheng Zeng and Hongming Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **Atari and Mujoco environments**, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for Atari games and the **Mujoco** environment for continuous control tasks. This is a strong indication that these environments are associated with specific datasets.

I will then look for any explicit dataset names or references in the **experiments section**. The authors refer to the **Atari benchmark** and **Mujoco environments**, but I need to confirm if they provide specific dataset citations or references.

After reviewing the **References section**, I will extract the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

2. **Mujoco**: The citation for the Mujoco environment is:
   > Yan Duan, Xi Chen, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman, and Pieter Abbeel. *Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for continuous control*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1329â€“1338, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
