To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Intelligent SDWN Routing Algorithm Based on Network Situational Awareness and Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jinqiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that their work builds upon.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

The **experimental results** section is crucial, as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation, including performance metrics and comparisons with other methods. If the authors refer to specific datasets here, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Mininet-WIFI" or "sFlow-RT," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
