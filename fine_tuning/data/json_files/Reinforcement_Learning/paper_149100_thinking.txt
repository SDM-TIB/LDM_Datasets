To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Verification of Dissipativity and Evaluation of Storage Function in Economic Nonlinear MPC using Q-Learning" by Arash Bahari Kordabad and Sebastien Gros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or case studies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **section 4 (Simulation)**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of Q-learning in the context of Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (ENMPC) but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to **section 4**, which details the simulations and case studies.

In **section 4.1 (LQR case)**, the authors describe a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem but do not specify a dataset; instead, they present a theoretical example. Similarly, in **section 4.2 (Non-dissipative dynamics)** and **section 4.3 (Non-polynomial case)**, the authors provide theoretical models and examples without referencing any datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical frameworks and simulations rather than empirical datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. If there were datasets, I would ensure to note their names, descriptions, and full citations as per the requirements.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and if any were present, I would have extracted them by identifying their names and descriptions in the relevant sections and then locating their full citations in the references.
