To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handling Climate Change Using Counterfactuals: Using Counterfactuals in Data Augmentation to Predict Crop Growth in an Uncertain Climate Future" by Mohammed Temraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a CBR system (PBI-CBR) for predicting grass growth, which suggests that there may be datasets related to grass growth and climate data.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (The Problem: Grass Growth Prediction for Sustainable Dairy Farming)**, where the authors mention the PastureBase Ireland (PBI) system, which has records of grass covers for individual farms. This indicates that the PBI dataset is likely a key dataset used in their research.

In **section 2 (Study 1: Predicting Climate Disruption with PBI-CBR)**, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the PBI dataset is drawn from over 6,000 farms over six years (2013-2018) with a total of 70,091 cases. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the PBI-CBR system predicts grass growth during climate disruptions.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **experiments** section. The authors refer to the use of historical extreme climate cases and how they are utilized in predictions, which further emphasizes the importance of the PBI dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is the PastureBase Ireland dataset, which is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. 

The citation for the PastureBase Ireland dataset is:
> Hanrahan, L., Geoghegan, A., O'Donovan, M., Griffith, V., Ruelle, E., Wallace, M., and Shalloo, L. "PastureBase Ireland." Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 136, 193-201 (2017).

Additionally, the authors refer to other studies and datasets related to climate change and agriculture, but the PBI dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
