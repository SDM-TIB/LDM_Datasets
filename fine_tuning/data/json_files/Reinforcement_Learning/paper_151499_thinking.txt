To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Function Approximation as a Computationally Efficient Method to solve Classical Reinforcement Learning Challenges" by Hari Srikanth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on two reinforcement learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the author describes the experiments conducted. The paper mentions two specific environments used for testing the algorithm: **CartPole** and **Acrobot**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments to confirm they are indeed datasets or benchmarks.

In the **results section**, the author provides performance comparisons of the proposed method against TRPO and PPO on the CartPole and Acrobot environments. This reinforces that these environments are the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **CartPole**: The dataset is based on a classic control problem where the objective is to balance a pole on a cart. The reference for this environment is:
   > B. R. Kiran et al., “Deep reinforcement learning for autonomous driving: A survey,” 2021.

2. **Acrobot**: This dataset involves a two-link robot arm that swings to reach a target height. The reference for this environment is:
   > A. Geramifard et al., “Rlpy: A value-function-based reinforcement learning framework for education and research,” Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 16, no. 46, pp. 1573–1578, 2015.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
