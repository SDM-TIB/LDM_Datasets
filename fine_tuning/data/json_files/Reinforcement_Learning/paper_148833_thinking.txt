To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Mobile Edge Computing with Heterogeneous Learning Tasks" by Shanfeng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a platform for machine learning tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved, especially in the context of training models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using several machine learning models, which implies that they likely utilized specific datasets for training and testing.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains images of fashion items, providing a more challenging alternative for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

3. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: This dataset includes 12,311 CAD models from 40 object categories, used for 3D object classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun and C. Cortes, “MNIST handwritten digit database,” 2010. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms,” CoRR, vol. abs/1708.07747, 2017. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747

- For the **ModelNet40 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Q. Charles, H. Su, M. Kaichun, and L. J. Guibas, “Pointnet: Deep learning on point sets for 3D classification and segmentation,” in Proc. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 77–85.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
