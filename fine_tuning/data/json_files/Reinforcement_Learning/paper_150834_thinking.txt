To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Data Efficiency in Reinforcement Learning: A Novel Imagination Mechanism Based on Mesh Information Propagation" by Zihang Wang and Maowei Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of data efficiency in reinforcement learning and introduces a novel mechanism, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors discuss the limitations of current reinforcement learning algorithms and mention various methods and algorithms but do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in their evaluations. In **section 4.2 (Environments)**, the authors list the environments used for their experiments, which include:

1. **Mujoco environments**: Specifically, "Ant", "Half Cheetah", and "Pendulum".
2. **Gym environments**: Specifically, "Lunar Lander" and "Acrobot".

These environments are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research, but they are not datasets in the traditional sense. Instead, they are simulation environments where agents can be trained and evaluated.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The citations for the environments are as follows:

- For **Mujoco**:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE, 2012. doi: 10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any specific datasets beyond these environments, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the environments mentioned in the paper.
