To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analytical valuation of vulnerable derivative claims with bilateral cash flows under credit, funding and wrong way risk" by Juan José Francisco Miguélez and Cristin Buescu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. I will look for any specific datasets that were used for numerical analysis or validation of the proposed models.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
