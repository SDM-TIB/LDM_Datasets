To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure Pretraining and Prompt Tuning for Knowledge Graph Transfer" by Wen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on three tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. In **section 4.1 (Pretraining)**, they mention creating a new dataset called **WFC** by combining three existing datasets: **WN18RR**, **FB15k-237**, and **Codex**. This indicates that WFC is a hybrid dataset derived from these three sources.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset:

1. **WFC**: The authors describe it as a combination of three datasets with diverse graph structures. I will note that it includes WN18RR, FB15k-237, and Codex.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is mentioned as a dense and unbalanced knowledge graph. I will need to find its full citation in the references.

3. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is described as a dense and balanced knowledge graph. I will also look for its citation.

4. **Codex**: This dataset is characterized as a sparse and unbalanced knowledge graph. I will find its citation as well.

In **section 4.2 (Task 1: Triple Classification)**, the authors mention using the **WN18RR** dataset for their experiments. This confirms its use in the study.

In **section 4.3 (Task 2: Zero-shot Image Classification)**, they mention using the **AwA-KG** dataset, which I will also need to extract and cite.

In **section 4.4 (Task 3: Question Answering)**, they refer to the **CommonsenseQA** dataset, which is another dataset I need to extract.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Zhiqing Sun, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jian-Yun Nie, and Jian Tang. *RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space*. In ICLR (Poster), 2019.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto García-Durán, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In NIPS, 2013.

- For **Codex**, the citation is:
  > This dataset does not have a specific citation mentioned in the paper, but it is commonly referenced in the context of knowledge graphs.

- For **AwA-KG**, the citation is:
  > Yuxia Geng, Jiaoyan Chen, Zhuo Chen, Jeff Z. Pan, Zhiquan Ye, Zonggang Yuan, Yantao Jia, and Huajun Chen. *OntoZSL: Ontology-enhanced Zero-shot Learning*. In WWW, 2021.

- For **CommonsenseQA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge*. In NAACL-HLT, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented each dataset mentioned in the paper.
