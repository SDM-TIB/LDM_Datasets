To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PID Accelerated Temporal Difference Algorithms" by Mark Bedaywi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental setups that involve data.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific datasets that are used in the experiments, as well as any references to prior works that may have introduced these datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using environments such as **Chain Walk**, **Cliff Walk**, and **Garnet**. I will take note of these environments as they are likely to be the datasets used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as I need to provide proper attribution for each dataset mentioned. I will look for any papers or sources that describe these environments in detail.

1. **Chain Walk**: The dataset/environment is described as a circular chain of 50 states with specific reward structures. However, it does not have a formal citation as it is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning.

2. **Cliff Walk**: This environment is also a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning literature. It is typically referenced in works discussing grid-world environments. The original reference for this environment is:
   > Rakhsha, A., Wang, A., Ghavamzadeh, M., & Farahmand, A.-M. (2022). *Operator splitting value iteration*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35.

3. **Garnet**: This is a randomly generated environment described in the paper. Similar to the other environments, it may not have a specific citation but is based on common practices in reinforcement learning research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets that have them. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
