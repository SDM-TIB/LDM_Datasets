To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Proximal/Trust Region Policy Optimization" by Boyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named along with their descriptions. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training their models, I will record the name of the dataset, its purpose, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data included, and any splits (train/test) mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions using the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details and citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for further use or analysis.
