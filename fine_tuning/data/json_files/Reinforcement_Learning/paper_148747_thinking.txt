To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization via Enhanced Exploration Efficiency" by Junwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on multiple tasks of the MuJoCo physical simulator, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention using several tasks from the MuJoCo simulator, specifically **Halfcheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Swimmer-v2**. This indicates that these tasks serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. The authors describe the MuJoCo environment and its tasks, but they do not provide separate dataset citations for each task. Instead, they refer to the MuJoCo simulator as the source of these tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the original source of the MuJoCo simulator. The relevant citation is:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Emo Todorov. *Convex and analytically-invertible dynamics with contacts and constraints: Theory and implementation in mujoco*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pages 6054â€“6061, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **MuJoCo Tasks**: The datasets used in the experiments are derived from the MuJoCo simulator, specifically the tasks mentioned (Halfcheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, Swimmer-v2). The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is provided above.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or review.
