To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Proximal Policy Optimization’s Heavy-tailed Gradients" by Saurabh Garg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not detail datasets, it can hint at their existence.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains specific names and details about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments. However, they do not specify individual datasets in the traditional sense, as MuJoCo is a physics engine used for simulating environments rather than a dataset itself. Instead, they refer to various tasks within the MuJoCo framework, such as **HalfCheetah-v2**, **Ant-v2**, **Hopper-v2**, **Walker2d-v2**, **Humanoid-v2**, **Reacher-v2**, **InvertedPendulum-v2**, and **CartPole-v1**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the MuJoCo environments. The paper cites the original MuJoCo paper, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the MuJoCo environments is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033). IEEE.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MuJoCo environments as the dataset reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MuJoCo environments** (including tasks like HalfCheetah-v2, Ant-v2, etc.), with the citation:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033). IEEE.

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and cited the datasets used in the research paper.
