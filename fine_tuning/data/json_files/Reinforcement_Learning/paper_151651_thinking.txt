To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimistic Q-learning for average reward and episodic reinforcement learning" by Priyank Agrawal and Shipra Agrawal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and their relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, ready for any required output or further processing. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper accurately and comprehensively.
