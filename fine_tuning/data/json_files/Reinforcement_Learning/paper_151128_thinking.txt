To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?" by Andreas Madsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the faithfulness of self-explanations on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using four datasets for their evaluations:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and contains 25,000 reviews.
2. **bAbI Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-choice question answering and consists of 1,000 stories.
3. **MCTest Dataset**: Another dataset for multi-choice question answering, containing 600 stories.
4. **RTE Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference and consists of 277 sentence pairs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MCTest Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **RTE Dataset**, the citation is:

Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty, Visual Object Classification, and Recognising Textual Entailment, pages 177–190. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
