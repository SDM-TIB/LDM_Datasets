To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Prosthetics Using Imitation Learning" by Waleed D. Khamies et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the methods used, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of designing artificial limbs and mention the use of a biomechanical model in the OpenSim environment. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe running reinforcement learning algorithms in the OpenSim ProstheticsEnv environment. They mention training a DDPG agent but do not provide specific dataset names. Instead, they focus on the algorithms and the environment used for training.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets. However, the results primarily discuss the performance of the algorithms rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will look into the **references section** to see if any cited works might refer to datasets relevant to the study. The references include various works related to reinforcement learning and imitation learning, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide specific dataset names. Instead, they focused on the OpenSim environment for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that while the paper discusses the use of the OpenSim environment for training reinforcement learning agents, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. This is an important observation for future readers or researchers looking for datasets in this area.
