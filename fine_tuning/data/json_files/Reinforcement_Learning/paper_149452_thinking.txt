To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieving Speaker Information from Personalized Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition" by Salima Mdhaffar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **TED-LIUM 3 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Framework)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide detailed information about the **TED-LIUM 3 dataset**, including its size and the number of speakers involved. The dataset is described as a large corpus of 452 hours of TED talks pronounced by 2,295 speakers, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors present statistics about the dataset, including the duration of speech, the number of speakers, and the gender distribution. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TED-LIUM 3 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> François Hernandez, Vincent Nguyen, Sahar Ghannay, Natalia Tomashenko, and Yannick Estève. *TED-LIUM 3: twice as much data and corpus repartition for experiments on speaker adaptation*. In Speech and Computer. 2018, pp. 198–208, Springer International Publishing.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the TED-LIUM 3 dataset, I will ensure that this dataset is the only one I extract, as no other datasets are explicitly mentioned in the sections I reviewed.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
