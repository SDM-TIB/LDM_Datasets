To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search-Based Metaheuristic For Optimal Fleet Composition Considering Vehicle Routing Using Branch & Bound" by T.M.J.T. Baltussen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or case studies that were used in their experiments. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly looking for any mention of datasets used for experiments or simulations. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include specific datasets or sources of data.

In the **results** section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the data used in the experiments. This may provide insights into the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each one. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well.

Now, I will proceed to extract the datasets and their citations based on the information I have gathered from the paper.
