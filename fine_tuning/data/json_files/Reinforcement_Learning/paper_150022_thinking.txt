To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformers Are Sample-Efficient World Models" by Vincent Micheli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the IRIS agent on the Atari 100k benchmark, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation protocol. Here, they mention that they evaluate their method on the **Atari 100k benchmark**, which consists of 26 Atari games. This is a significant dataset for reinforcement learning research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari 100k benchmark. The citation is as follows:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the Atari 100k benchmark.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Atari 100k benchmark, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focused on the experiments section to confirm the dataset used for evaluation.
3. Retrieved the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now create the dataset entry for the Atari 100k benchmark.
