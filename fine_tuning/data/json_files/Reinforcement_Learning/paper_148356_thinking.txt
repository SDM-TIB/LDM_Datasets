To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Constrained Q-learning" by Gabriel Kalweit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **HighD dataset**, which is a strong indicator that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, and they mention using the **HighD dataset** for training their agent in autonomous driving.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors provide a description of the **HighD dataset**: it contains 147 hours of top-down recordings of German highways, which is crucial for understanding the context in which the dataset is used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HighD dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Krajewski, R.; Bock, J.; Kloeker, L.; and Eckstein, L. 2018. *The highD Dataset: A Drone Dataset of Naturalistic Vehicle Trajectories on German Highways for Validation of Highly Automated Driving Systems*. In 2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2118â€“2125. doi:10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569552.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes all necessary details, including the citation, to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the dataset authors.
