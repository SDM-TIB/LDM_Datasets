To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actor Prioritized Experience Replay" by Baturay Saglam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, which is a well-known platform for reinforcement learning tasks. I will note this as it may refer to multiple environments that can be considered datasets in the context of reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to retrieve the complete citation for each.

For example, if the paper references the **MuJoCo** physics engine or specific tasks within it (like Ant, HalfCheetah, etc.), I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these environments to provide accurate citations.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and are complete, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, so that they can be easily referenced by others.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
