To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Self-supervised Nighttime Image Enhancement and Depth Estimation" by Yupeng Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their method on two established datasets: **nuScenes** and **RobotCar**. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **nuScenes**: This dataset is described as a large autonomous driving dataset comprising 1000 video clips collected in diverse road scenes and weather conditions. This dataset is known for its challenging scenarios, which is relevant to the authors' work.

2. **RobotCar**: This dataset is noted as a large-scale autonomous driving dataset that includes driving videos captured on a consistent route during various weather conditions, traffic conditions, and times of day and night.

Additionally, the authors introduce a new dataset called **CARLA-EPE**, which is a photo-realistically enhanced nighttime dataset based on the CARLA simulator. This dataset is significant because it provides dense ground truth for depth estimation, which is crucial for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **RobotCar**, the citation is:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 3â€“15, 2017.

- For **CARLA-EPE**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Yupeng Zheng, Chengliang Zhong, Pengfei Li, Huan-ang Gao, Yuhang Zheng, Bu Jin, Ling Wang, Hao Zhao, Guyue Zhou, Qichao Zhang, and Dongbin Zhao. *CARLA-EPE: A photo-realistically enhanced nighttime dataset with dense depth ground truth*. In Joint Self-supervised Nighttime Image Enhancement and Depth Estimation, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
