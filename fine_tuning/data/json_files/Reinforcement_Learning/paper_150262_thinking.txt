To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Robot Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Guided Human Expert Sampling" by Ashish Kumar and Ilya Kuzovkin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on data collected from **MuJoCo** and **OffWorld Gym** learning environments, suggesting that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments using datasets generated from three learning tasks in simulated environments: **MuJoCo Cheetah**, **MuJoCo Ant**, and **OffWorld Gym Monolith**. This confirms that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper references the following:

1. **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033, IEEE, 2012.

2. **OffWorld Gym**: The citation for the OffWorld Gym environment is:
   > Ashish Kumar, Toby Buckley, John B Lanier, Qiaozhi Wang, Alicia Kavelaars, and Ilya Kuzovkin. *OffWorld Gym: Open-access physical robotics environment for real-world reinforcement learning benchmark and research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.08639, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
