To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Research on Robot Path Planning Based on Visual SLAM" by Wang Ruiqi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the project uses both an **open-source dataset** and a **self-made dataset** for experimental verification. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Experimental design and results)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **subsection 3.1.1**, the paper discusses the **TUM Dataset**, which is described as a series of open-source datasets maintained by the Technical University of Munich. It specifically mentions using the **RGB-D SLAM Dataset** from TUM for dense point cloud mapping experiments.

In **subsection 3.1.2**, the paper describes a **self-made dataset** that was recorded using an RGB-D camera in a controlled experimental environment. This section provides details about the setup and the purpose of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **TUM Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Informatik IX Computer Vision Group. *Computer Vision Group - Datasets*. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets (viewed 2024 April 21).

2. The **self-made dataset** does not have a formal citation since it is created by the author for the specific experiments in this project. However, I will note its description and context as it is relevant to the research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **TUM Dataset**: An open-source dataset series used for various vision and robotics algorithms, specifically the RGB-D SLAM Dataset for dense point cloud mapping.
- **Self-made Dataset**: A dataset recorded in a controlled environment using an RGB-D camera, designed to facilitate feature extraction and mapping.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
