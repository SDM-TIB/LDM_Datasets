To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pgx: Hardware-Accelerated Parallel Game Simulators for Reinforcement Learning" by Sotetsu Koyamada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that Pgx includes reinforcement learning environments commonly used as benchmarks in RL research, such as backgammon, chess, shogi, and Go. This indicates that these games may be associated with specific datasets or environments that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe various games implemented in Pgx, which may serve as the datasets for reinforcement learning experiments. I will pay particular attention to **Table 1**, which lists the available games in Pgx, as it may provide insights into the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the following games are explicitly mentioned as part of the Pgx framework:

1. **Backgammon**: A two-player game that incorporates chance events and is a benchmark for RL in stochastic environments.
2. **Chess**: A classic two-player perfect information game.
3. **Shogi**: A Japanese board game similar to chess, allowing captured pieces to be reused.
4. **Go**: A strategic board game that can be played on various board sizes, including 9x9 and 19x19.
5. **Animal Shogi**: A miniature version of shogi designed for children.
6. **Gardner Chess**: A variant of chess played on a smaller board.
7. **Hex**: A connection game played on a hexagonal grid.
8. **Othello**: A game where players aim to have the majority of discs on the board.
9. **Tic-tac-toe**: A simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
10. **2048**: A single-player game involving merging tiles.
11. **Bridge Bidding**: An imperfect information game played in teams.
12. **Sparrow Mahjong**: A simplified version of Japanese mahjong.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments that are referenced. However, since the paper primarily discusses the Pgx framework and its capabilities rather than specific datasets from external sources, I will note that the games themselves serve as the datasets for reinforcement learning experiments.

For the games mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper along with their citations, ensuring that I have captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
