To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NMR: Neural Manifold Representation for Autonomous Driving" by Unnikrishnan R. Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors plan to test their approach on **CARLA** and **SYNTHIA-SF**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors explicitly mention that they will conduct experiments on **CARLA** and **SYNTHIA-SF**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather more information about each dataset from the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations:

1. **CARLA**: The citation for CARLA is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning (pp. 1–16).

2. **SYNTHIA-SF**: The citation for SYNTHIA-SF is:
   > Hernandez-Juarez, D., Schneider, L., Espinosa, A., Vázquez, D., López, A. M., Franke, U., Pollefeys, M., & Moure, J. C. (2017). *Slanted stixels: Representing San Francisco’s steepest streets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.05397.

After collecting this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset with its respective citation. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for any future references to these datasets in research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
