To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning in Non-Markovian Environments" by Siddharth Chandak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention testing their proposed method on various environments, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to established datasets, I will need to ensure I capture the full citation for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets later.

As I read through the paper, I will note down any datasets mentioned, along with their descriptions and the context in which they were used. For example, if the authors mention using a specific environment like "Cartpole" or "Mountain Car," I will record these as datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each one. For instance, if the paper references the "Cartpole" environment, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this dataset and include that citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their sources, making it easier for others to reference or access them in the future.
