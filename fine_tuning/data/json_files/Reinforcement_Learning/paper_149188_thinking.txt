To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curious Explorer: a provable exploration strategy in Policy Learning" by Marco Miani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention two specific environments used for their experiments: **Consecutive Crossroad Traps (CCT)** and **Diabolical Combination Lock (DCL)**. I will note these as they are integral to the research findings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. Since CCT and DCL are likely derived from existing works, I will look for their original sources.

1. **Consecutive Crossroad Traps (CCT)**: This environment is described in the paper, but I need to find the original reference. The authors cite a previous work for this environment, which I will extract from the references.

2. **Diabolical Combination Lock (DCL)**: Similar to CCT, I will check the references for the original source of this environment.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference or analysis.
