To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive PER: Balancing Priority and Diversity Towards Stable Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Sanghwa Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their proposed method on Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **Atari games**, which indicates that the datasets used are likely related to these games.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluated their method on **58 Atari tasks**. This is a clear indication that the datasets are derived from the Atari 2600 environment, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the Atari datasets. The Atari 2600 games are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, and the original dataset is often cited as follows:

- For the Atari 2600 games, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, Ioannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, and Martin Riedmiller. *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets for each game, I will treat the entire collection of Atari games as a single dataset for the purpose of this extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari dataset as mentioned above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
