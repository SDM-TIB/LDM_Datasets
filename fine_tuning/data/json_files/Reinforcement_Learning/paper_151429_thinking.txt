To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularized Q-learning through Robust Averaging" by Peter Schmitt-FÃ¶rster and Tobias Sutter, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any sections that discuss the environments or benchmarks used for testing the proposed Q-learning method. For instance, the authors might refer to standard datasets or environments commonly used in reinforcement learning research, such as the OpenAI Gym environments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** as a testing environment, I would look for the citation:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will extract their names and corresponding citations in a similar manner.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper and provide proper citations for each one.
