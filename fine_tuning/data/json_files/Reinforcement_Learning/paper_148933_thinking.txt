To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Regret Bound and Experience Replay in Regularized Policy Iteration" by Nevena LaziÄ‡ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention two environments used for their experiments: **Cart-pole** and **Ball-in-cup**. I will note these as they are essential for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used.

For the **Cart-pole environment**, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the dataset or the environment setup. The citation for this environment is:
> Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., & Anderson, C. W. (1983). Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems. *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics*, 13(5), 834-846.

For the **Ball-in-cup environment**, I will also search for its original description or any relevant references. The citation for this environment is:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., d. L. Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, J., Merel, J., & Lefrancq, A. (2018). DeepMind control suite. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Cart-pole Environment**
   - Citation: Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., & Anderson, C. W. (1983). Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems. *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics*, 13(5), 834-846.

2. **Ball-in-cup Environment**
   - Citation: Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., d. L. Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, J., Merel, J., & Lefrancq, A. (2018). DeepMind control suite. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690*.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
