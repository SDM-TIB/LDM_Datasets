To extract datasets from the research paper titled "2D Matryoshka Sentence Embeddings" by Xianming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on STS tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **MultiNLI** and **SNLI** datasets for training, and they evaluate their model on the **STS benchmark**, which includes several datasets.

I will then gather details about each dataset:

1. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for training the model. It consists of a large collection of sentence pairs annotated with entailment relations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112–1122, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is also used for training. It contains a collection of labeled sentence pairs for natural language inference. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **STS Benchmark**: The authors evaluate their model on this benchmark, which consists of several datasets for semantic textual similarity. The benchmark includes datasets from STS 2012 to STS 2016, SICK-R, and STS-B. The citation for the STS benchmark is:
   > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Claire Cardie, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Weiwei Guo, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, Montse Maritxalar, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, Larraitz Uria, and Janyce Wiebe. *SemEval-2015 task 2: Semantic textual similarity, English, Spanish and pilot on interpretability*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015), pages 252–263, Denver, Colorado. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names and citations of the datasets used in the paper, which are essential for proper attribution and further research.
