To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Based Regularization for Deep Reinforcement Learning with Transcoder Networks" by Felix Leibfried and Peter Vrancx, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors empirically confirm their hypothesis on a range of **20 games from the Atari benchmark**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they validate their approach in the **Atari domain** and compare their results against the **DQN** baseline. This implies that the Atari games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific mentions of the datasets in the **background** or **related work sections**, as these sections might provide additional context or references to the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not provide specific names for the individual Atari games in the dataset section. However, they do mention that they evaluate their approach on **20 Atari games**. To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** to find the original source of the Atari benchmark.

The citation for the Atari benchmark is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253â€“279.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Atari benchmark as the dataset used in the experiments.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the general context of the datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to confirm the datasets used.
3. Look for citations in the references to provide authoritative sources for the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari benchmark, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
