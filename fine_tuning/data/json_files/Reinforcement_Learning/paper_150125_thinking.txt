To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic-to-real Composite Semantic Segmentation in Additive Manufacturing" by Aliaksei Petsiuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the generation of labeled image datasets for semantic segmentation, which indicates that datasets are present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining annotated databases for training machine learning models, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Creation of synthetic image datasets." Here, the authors describe the generation of three independent labeled synthetic image datasets:

1. **Entire Part Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,763 image-mask pairs for the semantic segmentation of the entire 3-D printed part.

2. **Top Layer Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,570 image-mask pairs specifically for the segmentation of the top layer of the printed parts.

3. **Internal Structure Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,140 image-mask pairs for the segmentation of the in-fill, shell, and support structures of the printed parts.

In the **results section**, the authors provide mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are generated by the authors, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are part of the authors' work and refer to the paper itself for their details.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Entire Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Petsiuk, A., Singh, H., Dadhwal, H., & Pearce, J. M. (2022). Synthetic-to-real Composite Semantic Segmentation in Additive Manufacturing. *Journal of Additive Manufacturing*, 36, 101473. doi:10.1016/j.addma.2022.101473.

- For the **Top Layer Dataset**, the citation is the same as above, as it is part of the same study.

- For the **Internal Structure Dataset**, the citation remains the same.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly referenced according to the paper's contributions.
