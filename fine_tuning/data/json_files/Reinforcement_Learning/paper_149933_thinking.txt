To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keep your Distance: Determining Sampling and Distance Thresholds in Machine Learning Monitoring" by Al-Harith Farhad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a model-agnostic approach called SafeML, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the application of SafeML in various contexts, including traffic sign recognition and the CARLA automotive simulator. This indicates that specific datasets are used for these applications.

In the **methodology section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**: This dataset is described as a collection of traffic sign images along with their labels, which is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in the context of traffic sign recognition.

2. **CARLA Simulator Dataset**: The authors mention that they generated datasets from the CARLA open-source automotive simulator, which is used for developing and validating autonomous driving systems.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GTSRB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stallkamp, J., Schlipsing, M., Salmen, J., & Igel, C. (2012). Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition. *Neural Networks*, 32, 323â€“332. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.016

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In *1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
