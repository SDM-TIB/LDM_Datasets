To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Enabling a Reliable Quality Monitoring System for Additive Manufacturing Process using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Yaser Banadaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a quality grading system for additive manufacturing (AM) using a deep learning model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to images of defects in the AM process.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Developing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model)**, particularly the subsection **A (Data Collection from the AM process)**. Here, the authors describe the data collection process in detail. They mention that an image acquisition system was established to capture images of each layer during the printing process, which indicates that the dataset consists of images of printed parts with various defects.

The authors specify that the dataset includes images collected under different printing speeds (ranging from 50 mm/s to 1000 mm/s) and temperatures (from 185째C to 260째C). They also mention that the dataset is annotated into five quality grades (A to E) based on the printing quality.

In **section III (Evaluating the Model for Automated Detection of the AM Quality)**, the authors provide further details about the dataset's performance measures and classification into 21 classes based on different speeds and temperatures. This reinforces the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, it appears that the authors did not reference a publicly available dataset but rather created their own dataset for this study.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Custom Additive Manufacturing Quality Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of images captured during the additive manufacturing process, specifically focusing on internal and surface defects. The images are collected at various printing speeds (50 mm/s to 1000 mm/s) and temperatures (185째C to 260째C). The dataset is annotated into five quality grades (A to E) based on the quality of the printed parts.
   - **Citation**: Yaser Banadaki, Nariman Razaviarab, Hadi Fekrmandi, and Safura Sharifi. *Toward Enabling a Reliable Quality Monitoring System for Additive Manufacturing Process using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. [Journal/Conference details if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and provided the necessary citation for the authors' original work.
