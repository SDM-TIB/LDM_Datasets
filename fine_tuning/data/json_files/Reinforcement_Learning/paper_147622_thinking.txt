To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Optimal Online Method of Selecting Source Policies for Reinforcement Learning," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted. The introduction will likely discuss the importance of the experiments and may reference specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any mentions of specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments in a **grid-based robot navigation domain**. I will look for any specific datasets or environments that were used in this context. If the authors refer to any established datasets or benchmarks, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned. If the datasets are original or specific to this research, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific grid-world environment or a previously established dataset for reinforcement learning, I will ensure to capture the full citation for that dataset. If they reference any foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, I will include those citations too.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help me extract all relevant datasets effectively while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
