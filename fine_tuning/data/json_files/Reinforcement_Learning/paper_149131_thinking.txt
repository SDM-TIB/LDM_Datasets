To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Q-Learning in Zero-sum Markov Games" by Muhammed O. Sayin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or details about the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used in simulations or experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics that define the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, making it easy for others to reference or access the datasets used in this research.
