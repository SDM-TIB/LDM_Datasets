To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-AMPLIFY: Improving Small Language Models with Self Post Hoc Explanations" by Milan Bhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the performance of Self-AMPLIFY is evaluated on two datasets requiring reasoning abilities, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ARC Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is described as a commonsense reasoning dataset containing grade-school science questions. It is specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to use prior knowledge about the world.

2. **Snarks Dataset**: This dataset aims to distinguish between sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences, serving as another benchmark for evaluating language models' performance.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ARC Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clark, P., Cowhey, I., Etzioni, O., Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., Schoenick, C., & Tafjord, O. (2018). *Think you have solved question answering? Try ARC, the AI2 reasoning challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05457.

- For the **Snarks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Srivastava, A., Rastogi, A., Rao, A., Awal Md Shoeb, A., Abid, A., Fisch, A., & Brown, A. R. (2022). *Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04615.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
