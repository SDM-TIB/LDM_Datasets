To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement co-Learning of Deep and Spiking Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Mapless Navigation with Neuromorphic Hardware" by Guangzhi Tang, Neelesh Kumar, and Konstantinos P. Michmizos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of mapless navigation and the need for energy-efficient solutions, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then move to the **methods section**, where they describe the Spiking Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (SDDPG) algorithm and its implementation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets within the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the environments used for training and validation. They mention that training was performed in the Gazebo simulator and validated in both simulated and real-world environments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works correspond to datasets or benchmarks relevant to their experiments. I will look for papers that describe datasets used in similar contexts, such as those related to robotic navigation or reinforcement learning.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that could be associated with datasets or benchmarks:

1. **Gazebo Simulator**: While not a dataset per se, the Gazebo simulator is a widely used platform for training robotic algorithms. The citation for Gazebo is:
   > Koenig, N., & Howard, A. (2004). *Design and use paradigms for gazebo, an open-source multi-robot simulator*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2004.

2. **RPLIDAR S1**: The paper mentions using an RPLIDAR S1 laser range scanner for real-world validation. The citation for this hardware is:
   > SLAMTEC. (2017). *RPLIDAR S1 User Manual*. Retrieved from https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/RPLIDAR

3. **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: The authors mention using ROS for middleware during training and validation. The citation for ROS is:
   > Quigley, M., Conley, K., Gerkey, B., Faust, J., Foote, T., Leibs, J., ... & Wheeler, R. (2009). *ROS: An open-source Robot Operating System*. In ICRA Workshop on Open Source Software.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the environments used for training were designed with increasing complexity, but no formal dataset names are given. 

Now, I will compile the relevant citations into a structured format for review or downstream processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each reference related to datasets or experimental setups.
