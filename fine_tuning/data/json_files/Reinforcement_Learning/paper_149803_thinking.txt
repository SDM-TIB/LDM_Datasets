To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evaluation Study of Intrinsic Motivation Techniques applied to Reinforcement Learning over Hard Exploration Environments" by Alain Andres et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. However, it sets the context for the research, which may lead to dataset references in later sections.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any prior work that utilized specific datasets. This section often contains background information that can hint at the datasets used in the experiments.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for the experiments. The authors may describe the environments or benchmarks they used, which could include specific datasets. In this paper, they mention using environments from the **MiniGrid** framework, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors detail the specific environments they used for their experiments. They mention three environments: **MultiRoomNXSY**, **KeyCorridorS3R3**, and **ObstructedMaze2Dlh**. While these are not traditional datasets in the sense of labeled data, they are procedural environments that serve as datasets for testing the intrinsic motivation techniques.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the MiniGrid environments or any other datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important to provide full citations for the datasets or environments used.

The references for the MiniGrid environments are as follows:
- For the **MiniGrid** framework, the citation is:
  > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for openai gym*. GitHub repository, 2018. Available at: https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets and environments into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned in the paper.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets/environments:
1. **MultiRoomNXSY** - A procedural environment from the MiniGrid framework.
2. **KeyCorridorS3R3** - Another procedural environment from the MiniGrid framework.
3. **ObstructedMaze2Dlh** - Yet another procedural environment from the MiniGrid framework.

I will ensure to include the citation for the MiniGrid framework as the authoritative source for these environments. After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output.
