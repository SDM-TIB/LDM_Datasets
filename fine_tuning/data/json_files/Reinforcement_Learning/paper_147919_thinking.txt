To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Discrete-Continuous Hybrid Action Spaces" by Haotian Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their algorithms on several challenging tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their evaluations on two specific environments: **Half Field Offense (HFO)** and **Ghost Story**. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets or environments used for testing their algorithms.

In **Section 4.1 (Experiments with Half Field Offense)**, the authors mention that HFO is an abstraction of a full RoboCup 2D game and provide a link to the official website for more details. They describe the hybrid action space and the specific actions available to agents, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation. However, I will note that HFO is a well-known benchmark in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

In **Section 4.2 (Experiments with Ghost Story)**, the authors describe the MMORPG game "Ghost Story" and the specific features of the agents involved. They also mention the actions available to each hero agent and the joint reward structure. Similar to HFO, they do not provide a formal dataset citation, but I will recognize that this game serves as a dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any formal citations related to the datasets or environments mentioned. The authors reference several papers, but they do not provide specific citations for HFO or Ghost Story. However, I can still provide the following citations based on the context:

1. **Half Field Offense (HFO)**:
   - The citation for HFO can be attributed to the original work that introduced this environment:
     > Hausknecht, M. J., & Stone, P. (2016). Half field offense: An environment for multiagent learning and ad hoc teamwork. In Proceedings of ALA, pages 1391â€“1398.

2. **Ghost Story**:
   - Since Ghost Story is a specific game developed by NetEase, I will note that it is a proprietary game and may not have a formal citation in the same way as academic datasets. However, I can mention it as follows:
     > Ghost Story (QianNvYouHun) is a fantasy MMORPG developed by NetEase, used as a testing environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all relevant datasets along with their citations, even if some are not formally cited in the paper.
