To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Medial Voxels: Learned Medial Axis Approximations for Anatomical Shape Modeling" by Antonio Pepe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used. In the introduction, I will look for any mentions of specific datasets or challenges that the authors reference.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly subsection A, which is explicitly labeled as "Datasets." This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, the types of data they contain, and any specific characteristics that are mentioned.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of 154 labeled left cardiac atria from MRI scans, specifically from the 2018 Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge.

2. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon Dataset**: This dataset includes 270 hippocampi from MRI scans, which are used for evaluating segmentation algorithms.

3. **SegThor Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains 40 aortae from CT scans, utilized in the SegThor Challenge for segmentation tasks.

4. **Yao et al. Dataset**: This dataset comprises 100 aortic dissections from CT scans, as referenced in the work by Yao et al.

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge Dataset**:
  > Z. Xiong et al., “A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging,” *Medical Image Analysis*, vol. 67, p. 101832, 2021.

- For the **Medical Segmentation Decathlon Dataset**:
  > A. L. Simpson et al., “A large annotated medical image dataset for the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms,” arXiv:1902.09063, 2019.

- For the **SegThor Challenge Dataset**:
  > Z. Lambert et al., “Segthor: Segmentation of thoracic organs at risk in ct images,” in *Proc. IPTA*, pp. 1–6, IEEE, 2020.

- For the **Yao et al. Dataset**:
  > Z. Yao et al., “Imagetbad: A 3D computed tomography angiography image dataset for automatic segmentation of type-b aortic dissection,” *Front. Physiol.*, vol. 12, 2021.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
