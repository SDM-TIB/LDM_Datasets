To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Model Exploration for Tumor Treatment Simulations" by Charilaos Akasiadis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract mentions the use of a multi-scale simulator and a Genetic Algorithm for tumor treatment simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to tumor growth and treatment responses.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the background and significance of their research. Here, I will look for any references to specific datasets or sources of data that were utilized in their simulations or analyses.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section may explicitly mention datasets used for calibration or validation of the model. For example, if the authors refer to specific experimental data or previously published datasets, I will note these down.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the datasets used for analysis. The authors may present results based on specific datasets, and this will help confirm the datasets' relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the citation. If they have created their own dataset, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.
