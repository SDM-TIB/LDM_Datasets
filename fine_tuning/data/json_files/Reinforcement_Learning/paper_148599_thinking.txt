To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2020 Task 5: Counterfactual Recognition" by Qiong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the task provides a benchmark for counterfactual recognition with two subtasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data development** section, specifically looking for any explicit descriptions of datasets. The authors mention that they extracted over **60,000 candidate counterfactual statements** from news reports in three domains: finance, politics, and healthcare. This indicates that there is a dataset created for the task.

In the **data statistics** subsection, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used for both subtasks. For **Subtask-1**, they mention a total of **20,000 statements**, with **13,000** for training and **7,000** for testing. For **Subtask-2**, they mention **5,501 samples**, with **3,551** for training and the rest for testing. This confirms the existence of two distinct datasets for the subtasks.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of the datasets mentioned. The paper provides links to the data and baseline code, which are crucial for citation:

1. The dataset for Subtask-1 and Subtask-2 can be found at:
   > https://zenodo.org/record/3932442

2. The official evaluation data and leaderboard are available at:
   > https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21691

Since the paper does not provide traditional citations for the datasets, I will create a citation entry based on the information available in the paper:

- For the dataset used in Subtask-1 and Subtask-2, I will cite it as:
  > Zhang, Q., Obadinma, S., Zhao, H., Yang, X., & Matwin, S. (2020). *SemEval-2020 Task 5: Counterfactual Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020), Barcelona, Spain. Available at: https://zenodo.org/record/3932442

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
