To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosted Genetic Algorithm using Machine Learning for Traffic Control Optimization" by Tuo Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for training or testing the models. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using a traffic simulation model and various machine learning regression models. I will look for any specific datasets that were generated or used in these simulations. If the authors refer to datasets from previous studies or publicly available datasets, I will note those as well.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their models in relation to specific datasets. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Aimsun simulation data," I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this dataset in detail. If they refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to capture those citations accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
