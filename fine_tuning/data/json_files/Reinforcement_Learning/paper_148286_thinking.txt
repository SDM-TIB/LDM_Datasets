To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal-adaptive Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Wen-Ji Zhou and Yang Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for testing the proposed methods. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will pay close attention to any named datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

As I read through the **experiments section**, I will note any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to environments like "Mujoco" or "Atari games," I will identify these as datasets or environments relevant to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Mujoco" physics engine, I will find the citation:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033, Vilamoura, Portugal, 2012.

Similarly, if the paper discusses "Atari games," I will ensure to find the relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym toolkit:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
