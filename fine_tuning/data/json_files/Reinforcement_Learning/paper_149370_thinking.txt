To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigation in Urban Environments Amongst Pedestrians Using Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Niranjan Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated in a custom urban environment developed in the CARLA simulator, which suggests that this simulator environment is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the parts that describe the training and evaluation processes. Here, the authors mention that they trained their multi-objective reinforcement learning agents in a custom urban environment created in the CARLA simulator. This confirms that the CARLA simulator environment is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** section. However, the paper primarily focuses on the custom environment created in CARLA, and there are no other datasets explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is the primary dataset used in this research. The relevant citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the dataset used in this research.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CARLA simulator, ensuring it is ready for review or further processing.
