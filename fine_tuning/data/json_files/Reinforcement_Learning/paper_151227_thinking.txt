To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Agricultural Management Considering N2O Emission and Climate Variability with Uncertainties" by Zhaoan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of AI in agricultural management and mentions the use of a crop simulator, which suggests that datasets related to agricultural practices and emissions may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or studies that provide data for their research. They mention the use of historical data and various simulation tools, which may lead to specific datasets.

In the **methodologies section**, the authors describe the N2O emission forecasting model and mention a dataset from Saha’s study spanning the years 2012 to 2017. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used, and I will note the details provided about it.

The paper states that the dataset contains 919 samples and includes features like precipitation and air temperature, which are critical for their analysis. I will ensure to capture the dataset's name and its context in the research.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their simulations and the impact of various factors on agricultural management, but they do not introduce new datasets here. Instead, they refer back to the datasets mentioned earlier.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used for N2O emission forecasting is:

- For the dataset from Saha’s study:
  > Saha D, Basso B, Robertson G P. (2021). Machine learning improves predictions of agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from intensively managed cropping systems. *Environmental Research Letters*, 16(2): 024004. DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/abd2f3.

Next, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and future reference.
