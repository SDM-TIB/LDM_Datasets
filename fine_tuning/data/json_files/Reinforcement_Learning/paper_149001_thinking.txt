To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforcement Learning Environment For Job-Shop Scheduling" by Pierre Tassel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments that follow.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using benchmark instances from two sources: **Taillard's instances** and **Demirkol's instances**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they selected a class of 10 instances from Taillard (1993) and 5 instances from Demirkol, Mehta, and Uzsoy (1998). They provide details about the number of jobs and machines in these instances, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Taillard's instances**, the citation is:
   > Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 64, 278–285.

2. For **Demirkol's instances**, the citation is:
   > Demirkol, E., Mehta, S., & Uzsoy, R. (1998). Benchmarks for shop scheduling problems. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 109(1), 137–141.

With these citations, I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
