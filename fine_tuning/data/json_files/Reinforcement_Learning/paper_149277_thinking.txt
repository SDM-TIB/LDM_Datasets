To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice" by Rishabh Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several key datasets:

1. **Atari 100k Benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating data efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. It consists of 26 Atari games and is noted for its computational demands and the statistical challenges it presents.

2. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a widely recognized benchmark in deep reinforcement learning, which the authors reference in relation to their evaluation protocols.

3. **Procgen Benchmark**: This benchmark consists of 16 diverse tasks designed to evaluate generalization in reinforcement learning.

4. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This suite is mentioned as another benchmark used for evaluating performance in continuous control tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For the **Atari 100k Benchmark**, the citation is:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

- For the **Procgen Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Jacob Hilton, Oleg Klimov, and John Schulman. *Phasic policy gradient*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.04416, 2020.

- For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
