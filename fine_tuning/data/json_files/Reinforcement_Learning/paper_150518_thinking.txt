To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Map-based experience replay: a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning" by Muhammad Burhan Hafez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks that their approach is evaluated against. This section often highlights the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains the most explicit information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss the datasets, as they may provide detailed descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I provide accurate and complete citations, as they are essential for proper attribution and further research.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MuJoCo environments** (Inverted-Pendulum, Reacher, HalfCheetah, and Walker2D) for their experiments. I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these environments to provide the full citations.

For the **MuJoCo environments**, the citations are as follows:

1. **MuJoCo**: 
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). "Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control." In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Piscataway, NJ: IEEE, pp. 5026â€“5033. doi: 10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

2. **Inverted-Pendulum**: This is a specific task within the MuJoCo framework, so it does not have a separate citation but is part of the MuJoCo reference.

3. **Reacher**: Similar to Inverted-Pendulum, this is also part of the MuJoCo environments.

4. **HalfCheetah**: Again, this is part of the MuJoCo environments.

5. **Walker2D**: This is also included in the MuJoCo environments.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
