To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phasic Policy Gradient" by Karl Cobbe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Procgen Benchmark** for their experiments. This benchmark is specifically designed for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, and it is crucial to note its significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Procgen Benchmark. The citation is as follows:
> K. Cobbe, C. Hesse, J. Hilton, and J. Schulman. *Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.01588, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Procgen Benchmark and does not mention any other datasets, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Procgen Benchmark, as it is essential for proper attribution and further reference.

In summary, I will create an entry for the Procgen Benchmark dataset, including its description and full citation, ready for structured output.
