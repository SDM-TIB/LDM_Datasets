To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning and Learning with Stochastic Action Sets" by Craig Boutilier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the foundations of MDPs with stochastic action sets but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in reinforcement learning but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results sections** for any references to datasets used in the empirical demonstrations. However, in this paper, the authors focus on theoretical foundations and algorithmic contributions rather than empirical evaluations that rely on specific datasets.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of previous research. The authors reference various studies and methodologies but do not provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. While the references include various papers, they do not explicitly mention datasets that the authors used in their own research.

Since this paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document each dataset with its full citation, following the same method of checking the relevant sections and the references for accurate citation details.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in this paper, and if there were, I would have provided the full citations accordingly.
