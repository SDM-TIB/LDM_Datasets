To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Cloud Scene Completion with Joint Color and Semantic Estimation from Single RGB-D Image" by Zhaoxuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors perform evaluations on the **3D-FUTURE data**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the training data generated from the **3D-FUTURE dataset**, which contains 16,563 unique 3D instances of furniture across 5,000 different rooms. They also mention generating a total of 2,541 camera viewpoints and rendering RGB-D images from these scenes.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors confirm that they used the **ScanNet V2 dataset** for testing, which contains over 1,500 scanned scenes. They specifically mention that they randomly selected 100 scenes from this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **3D-FUTURE Dataset**:
   > Fu, H., Jia, R., Gao, L., Gong, M., Zhao, B., Maybank, S., & Tao, D. (2020). *3D-FUTURE: 3D furniture shape with texture*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.09633.

2. **ScanNet V2 Dataset**:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nie√üner, M. (2017). *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for clarity and proper attribution. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
