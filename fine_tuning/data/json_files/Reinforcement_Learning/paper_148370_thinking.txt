To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Problems with Combined Individual and Team Reward" by Hassam Ullah Sheikh and Ladislau Bölöni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention evaluating their solution on the **defensive escort team problem**. This suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used for this evaluation, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They mention four specific environments for the defensive escort team problem:

1. **Random Landmarks**: A stochastic scenario where landmarks are randomly placed, and the VIP moves between them.
2. **Shopping Mall**: A scenario where landmarks represent shops, and bystanders navigate between them.
3. **Street**: A scenario simulating a crowded sidewalk with bystanders moving towards waypoints.
4. **Pie-in-the-Face**: A scenario where a bystander approaches the VIP to throw a pie.

These environments are crucial for understanding the datasets used in the experiments. However, I need to ensure that these environments are associated with any formal datasets or references.

I will also look at the **references section** to see if any of these environments are linked to specific datasets or prior works that provide datasets. The authors reference previous works that may have introduced these environments or datasets, particularly in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning.

After identifying the environments, I will compile the full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. If the environments are based on existing datasets, I will ensure to cite the original papers that introduced them.

For example, if the **defensive escort team problem** is based on a specific dataset or simulation framework, I will find the relevant citation. If the environments are derived from previous research, I will cite those papers accordingly.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that each dataset or environment is clearly described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
