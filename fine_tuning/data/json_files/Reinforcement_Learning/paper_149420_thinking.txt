To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARMS: Categorical-Antithetic-REINFORCE Multi-Sample Gradient Estimator" by Alek Dimitriev and Mingyuan Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that CARMS is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention using three datasets for their experiments:

1. **Dynamic MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **Fashion MNIST**: This dataset is a collection of fashion items, also structured similarly to MNIST, and is used as a drop-in replacement for benchmarking.

3. **Omniglot**: This dataset contains images of handwritten characters from various alphabets, and it is often used for few-shot learning tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Dynamic MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332â€“1338, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
