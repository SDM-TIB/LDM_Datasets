To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Microscopic Pandemic Simulator for Pandemic Prediction Using Scalable Million-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Zhenggang Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a "Microscopic Pandemic Simulator (MPS)" and the calibration of this model against real-world data in Allegheny, US. This indicates that there are datasets involved, likely related to demographic and contact network data.

Next, I will focus on the **methods** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors state that they built a comprehensive demographic dataset for Allegheny County, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their simulations.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors describe the dataset used for evaluation. They mention that their model is based on real-world data from Allegheny County, which includes demographic data and a contact network. They specify that the dataset includes:

1. **Demographic Dataset of Allegheny County**: This dataset includes characteristics of the population, such as age distribution and trajectories/positions of individuals.

2. **Facility Characteristics Dataset**: This dataset includes information about various facilities in Allegheny County, such as their locations, capacities, and types.

The authors also reference specific sources for their datasets in the appendix, which is crucial for obtaining full citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **demographic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wheaton, W. D. (2012). *2009 US Synthetic Population Ver. 2*. 

- For the **facility characteristics**, the citation is:
  > ArcGIS. (2020). *ArcGIS Business Analyst*. Retrieved from https://bao.arcgis.com/esriBAO/index.html.

Additionally, they reference data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health for hospital-related information:
  > Pennsylvania Department of Health. (2019). *Hospital Reports*. Retrieved from https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/HealthStatistics/HealthFacilities/HospitalReports/Pages/hospital-reports.aspx.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included, as they are essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
