To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Distributed Intelligence Architecture for B5G Network Automation" by Sayantini Majumdar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may discuss related work or methodologies that could hint at datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the simulations and experiments conducted. This section often contains details about the datasets used for validation or testing purposes. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the simulation configurations, as they may include dataset information.

In this paper, the authors describe a simulation setup for their proposed Q-Learning for Cooperation (QLC) framework. They mention a **virtualized environment** consisting of a Network Slice (NS) composed of Network Functions (NFs). However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they describe the parameters and configurations for their simulations, which are based on theoretical models rather than specific datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any works that might have provided data or benchmarks relevant to their study. The references include various papers and reports, but they do not point to any datasets directly.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper for the experiments conducted.
2. The authors utilized a simulation-based approach to validate their proposed framework, relying on theoretical models rather than real-world datasets.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any dataset references. If I were to document this in a structured format, I would note that no datasets were extracted from this research paper.
