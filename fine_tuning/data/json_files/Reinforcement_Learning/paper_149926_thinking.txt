To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Online System Identification for LTI Systems Using Reverse Experience Replay" by Ting-Jui Chang and Shahin Shahrampour, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the identification of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and mentions numerical experiments, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used in the numerical experiments. This section typically provides details about the data used for testing the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets or provide descriptions of the data, I will take note of them.

In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in the **numerical experiments section**. They mention using a network of LTI systems with a transition matrix \( A \) that is randomly generated. However, they do not specify a publicly available dataset but rather describe the data generation process. The noise follows a standard Gaussian distribution, and the transition matrix is constructed from orthogonal and diagonal matrices.

Since there are no specific datasets cited, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to their experiments. The references may include foundational works or datasets that are commonly used in the field of system identification.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the relevant citations for any datasets or data generation methods mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to any datasets from other works, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I provide full citations for any datasets or relevant works mentioned in the paper, even if they are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather methods for generating data.

In conclusion, I will document the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.
