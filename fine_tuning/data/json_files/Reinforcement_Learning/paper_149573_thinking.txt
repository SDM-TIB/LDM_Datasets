To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Costmap Inference for MPC via Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Keuntaek Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator** for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that there may be datasets related to this simulator.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the data used for training and testing. In this section, they specifically mention using the **NGSIM dataset** for lane change data. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including how it was filtered and the number of demonstrations included.

The authors describe the NGSIM dataset as follows:
- It includes lane change data collected from the **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)**, specifically from the **Interstate 80 Freeway dataset**. They filtered out noisy data and collected a total of **240 lane-changing behaviors**, which were divided into **215 training samples** and **25 test samples**. Each demonstration lasts **18 seconds**, capturing the behavior before, during, and after lane changes.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the NGSIM dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the NGSIM dataset is:
> "Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset." [Online]. Available: https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafÔ¨Åcanalysistools/ngsim.htm

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset in a typical academic format, I will construct a citation based on the information available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Identify the datasets mentioned in the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections.
2. Document the details of the **NGSIM dataset** as described in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve and format the citation for the NGSIM dataset from the references.
4. Prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
