To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training with Synthetic Data Helps Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Zecheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments with various offline reinforcement learning algorithms, which typically involve specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **D4RL Gym locomotion datasets** for their evaluations. This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with the D4RL benchmark that are relevant to their research.

I will then look for any specific references to the datasets within the text. The authors mention that they conducted experiments on multiple environments, including **HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker, and Ant**, which are part of the D4RL datasets. 

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of the D4RL datasets. The relevant citation for the D4RL datasets is:

- For **D4RL**:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **D4RL Gym locomotion datasets** (including HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker, and Ant).
   - Citation: Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
