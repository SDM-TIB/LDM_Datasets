To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Look into Causal Effects under Entangled Treatment in Graphs: Investigating the Impact of Contact on MRSA Infection" by Jing Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world MRSA dataset, which suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Simulation)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Random Transaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of synthetic graphs generated by the Erdös-Rényi model, with 30,000 nodes, 208,193 edges, 32 features, and 12 timestamps.

2. **Social Dataset**: A real-world social network dataset with 186,509 nodes, 61,572 edges, 21 features, and 15 timestamps.

3. **MRSA Dataset**: This dataset contains real-world hospital data for studying MRSA infection, with 52,406 nodes, 107,394 edges, 16 features, and 10 timestamps.

4. **Another Random Dataset**: This dataset has 11,044 nodes, 31,403 edges, 8 features, and 13 timestamps.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, which validates the datasets identified in section 4.1.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are either synthetic or real-world datasets that may not have formal citations, I will note that the MRSA dataset is based on real-world hospital data, and I will provide a citation for the relevant studies or sources that discuss MRSA infections.

For the **MRSA dataset**, I will cite the following relevant paper:
> Muto, C. A., Jernigan, J. A., Ostrowsky, B. E., Richet, H. M., Jarvis, W. R., Boyce, J. M., & Farr, B. M. (2003). SHEA guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus. *Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology*, 24(5), 362-386.

For the **Random Transaction** and **Social datasets**, since they are synthetic and based on specific models or real-world data, I will note that they are generated from the Erdös-Rényi model and real-world tracking data, respectively, but they do not have formal citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
