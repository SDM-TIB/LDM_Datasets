To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Entropy of Artificial Intelligence and a Case Study of AlphaZero" by Bo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the AlphaZero algorithm and its performance in games like chess, shogi, and Go, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of AlphaZero without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or case studies. I will pay close attention to any references to data used for training or evaluating the AlphaZero algorithm. However, the paper primarily discusses theoretical models and concepts without detailing specific datasets.

I will also check the **conclusions** and **future works** sections for any mention of datasets that may have been used or could be used in future research. Again, the focus remains on theoretical insights rather than empirical data.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include foundational papers on reinforcement learning and communication theory, but they do not provide specific datasets related to AlphaZero.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be extracted for citation. The paper focuses on theoretical constructs rather than empirical data.

Since no datasets were identified, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create for this paper. If I were to find datasets, I would ensure to document their full citations accurately, following the same method of extracting information from the relevant sections of the paper and the references.
