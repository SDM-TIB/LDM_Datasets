To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Dynamic Object Detection for Autonomous Driving using Prior 3D-Maps" by B. Ravi Kiran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Lidar point clouds and mentions evaluating the proposed algorithms on the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that this simulator may be a dataset or a source of data for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they use the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments, which is confirmed as a dataset source. They also mention that the CARLA simulator provides lidar point cloud data, which is essential for their dynamic object detection framework.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CARLA simulator is referenced in the paper, and I need to ensure I capture its citation correctly.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: This dataset is used for generating lidar point clouds and simulating dynamic objects in urban environments. It provides a reliable framework for testing the proposed algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced in future work or analyses.
