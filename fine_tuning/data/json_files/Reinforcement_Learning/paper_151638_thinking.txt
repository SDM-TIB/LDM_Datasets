To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DINO Pre-training for Vision-based End-to-end Autonomous Driving" by Shubham Juneja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA environment and mentions a benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In **section 4.1 (Implementation details)**, the authors mention that they collect data using a method called Roach, which implies that there is a dataset generated from this process. I will note this down as it is crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

Additionally, I will check for any references to existing datasets in the **related work section** or throughout the paper. The authors might refer to well-known datasets used in the field of autonomous driving, which I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the CARLA simulator, I will look for its citation:
- For the CARLA simulator, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., and Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. Conference on Robot Learning, PMLR, pp. 1â€“16.

If the paper discusses a dataset generated from the Roach method, I will need to ensure that I provide a citation for the original work that introduced this method:
- For the Roach method, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Q., Peng, Z., and Zhou, B. (2022). *Learning to drive by watching YouTube videos: Action-conditioned contrastive policy pretraining*. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
