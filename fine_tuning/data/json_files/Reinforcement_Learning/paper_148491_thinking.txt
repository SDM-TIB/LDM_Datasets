To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Heuristic Selection with Dynamic Algorithm Configuration" by David Speck et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments, while the introduction often contextualizes the research and may mention specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will pay special attention to that.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets used in the empirical evaluation of the proposed dynamic algorithm configuration approach. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using datasets from the International Planning Competition (IPC), I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for presentation or further processing, ensuring that they are well-organized and ready for any required format or structure.
