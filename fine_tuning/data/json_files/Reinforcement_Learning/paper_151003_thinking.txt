To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directly Attention Loss Adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay" by Zhuoying Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention integrating their method with various reinforcement learning algorithms and conducting experiments in different environments. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets referenced in these contexts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** environments for their experiments, I will note that down and find the appropriate citation. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. "OpenAI Gym," arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

If they refer to any other datasets, such as specific benchmarks or datasets used in reinforcement learning, I will extract those names and their corresponding citations in a similar manner.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
