To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlignIQL: Policy Alignment in Implicit Q-Learning through Constrained Optimization" by Longxiang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **D4RL datasets**, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors refer to the **D4RL datasets** multiple times, indicating that they are the primary datasets used for evaluation. 

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the D4RL datasets. The D4RL datasets are referenced as follows:

- For the D4RL datasets, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets within the D4RL collection, I will treat the D4RL datasets as a single entity for the purpose of extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the D4RL datasets, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry for the dataset that is ready for further processing or review.
