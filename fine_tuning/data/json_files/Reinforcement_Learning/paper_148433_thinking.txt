To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local and Global Explanations of Agent Behavior: Integrating Strategy Summaries with Saliency Maps" by Tobias Hubera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often includes detailed information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning and the evaluation of agent behaviors. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Atari 2600 game environments," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, if they reference any specific datasets used for training or evaluation, I will ensure to document those citations accurately.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
