To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Critic Algorithms using Cooperative Networks" by Debangshu Banerjee and Kavita Wagh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research but do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments with two frameworks: DQN and DDPG. They mention that they trained their models on specific environments, which are indicative of datasets. The environments mentioned are:

1. **OpenAI Gym CartPole**: This is a well-known reinforcement learning environment used for training agents to balance a pole on a cart. The dataset here is the set of state-action-reward transitions generated during the training process.

2. **OpenAI Gym BipedalWalker**: Another reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to train a robot to walk. Similar to CartPole, the dataset consists of state-action-reward transitions collected during the training episodes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the environments mentioned. While these environments are widely recognized and do not have traditional citations like datasets, I can reference the original sources for OpenAI Gym:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CartPole Environment**: A classic reinforcement learning environment for balancing a pole on a cart. The dataset consists of state-action-reward transitions generated during training.
   - Citation: Brockman et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549.

2. **BipedalWalker Environment**: A reinforcement learning environment for training a robot to walk. The dataset consists of state-action-reward transitions collected during training.
   - Citation: Brockman et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
