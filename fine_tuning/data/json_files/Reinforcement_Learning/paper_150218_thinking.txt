To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Deep Q-Learning in Opponent Modeling" by Yangtianze Tao and John Doe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating models in two environments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or environments in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention using two tasks from the **Multi Particle Environments (MPE)**, which is a key indicator that this is a dataset or environment relevant to their experiments.

I will then look for any specific datasets or environments mentioned in the text. The authors refer to the **Multi Particle Environments (MPE)** as the setting for their experiments, which is crucial information. I will need to confirm if they provide a citation or reference for this environment.

In the **References section**, I will check if there is a full citation for the **Multi Particle Environments (MPE)**. The citation is likely to be:

- For **Multi Particle Environments (MPE)**:
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, P., & Mordatch, I. (2017). *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

Next, I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the experiments. If the authors refer to any other datasets or environments, I will extract their names and corresponding citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
