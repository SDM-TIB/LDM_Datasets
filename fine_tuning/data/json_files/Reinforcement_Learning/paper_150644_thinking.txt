To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modern Constraint Programming Education: Lessons for the Future" by Tejas Santanam and Pascal Van Hentenryck, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss course content and assignments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that detail the course structure and assignments, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used in the context of constraint programming education.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **"Assignments" section**. This section discusses various assignments that involve modeling problems, and it may reference datasets used for these assignments. I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, along with their descriptions.

While reviewing the paper, I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are derived from existing literature or publicly available datasets, I will ensure to capture the original sources.

In the paper, the authors mention several assignments that utilize datasets, such as the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)** and **flood evacuation planning**. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations for these problems, which means I will need to look for external sources or standard datasets commonly used in these contexts.

For example, the CVRPTW is a well-known problem in operations research, and datasets for it can often be found in literature or repositories related to optimization problems. I will search for authoritative sources that provide datasets for these types of problems.

Once I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. If the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will reference the general datasets used in the field of constraint programming and optimization.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
