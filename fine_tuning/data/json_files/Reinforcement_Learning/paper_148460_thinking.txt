To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNRL at SemEval-2020 Task 5: Modelling Causal Reasoning in Language with Multi-Head Self-Attention Weights based Counterfactual Detection" by Rajaswa Patil and Veeky Baths, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the SemEval-2020 Task-5, which consists of two sub-tasks related to counterfactual detection, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention the data distribution across training, development, and test sets for the two sub-tasks. Specifically, they provide the following details:

1. **Counterfactual Detection**: 
   - Training: 11,700 samples
   - Development: 1,300 samples
   - Test: 7,000 samples

2. **Antecedent-Consequent Detection**:
   - Training: 3,195 samples
   - Development: 356 samples
   - Test: 1,950 samples

While the authors provide the number of samples for each task, they do not specify the exact dataset name used for these tasks. However, they reference the SemEval-2020 Task-5, which implies that the datasets are part of this task.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The relevant citation for the SemEval-2020 Task-5 is:

- For SemEval-2020 Task-5:
  > Xiaoyu Yang, Stephen Obadinma, Huasha Zhao, Qiong Zhang, Stan Matwin, and Xiaodan Zhu. *SemEval-2020 task 5: Counterfactual recognition*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020), Barcelona, Spain.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Counterfactual Detection Dataset**: 
   - Description: Dataset used for detecting counterfactual statements.
   - Citation: Yang et al. (2020).

2. **Antecedent-Consequent Detection Dataset**: 
   - Description: Dataset used for detecting antecedent and consequent spans in counterfactual statements.
   - Citation: Yang et al. (2020).

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
