To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improvements on Hindsight Learning" by Ameet Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of sparse reward problems in reinforcement learning but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this case, the authors describe various environments used for testing their methods, such as **FetchReach-v1**, **FetchSlide-v1**, and others. Each of these environments is likely associated with specific datasets or benchmarks used in reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if the environments mentioned have associated papers that provide more details about the datasets. The references include works related to Hindsight Experience Replay and other reinforcement learning techniques, but they do not directly cite datasets.

After identifying the environments, I will look for any additional information in the text that describes the datasets used for these environments. For instance, if the authors mention that they used the **MuJoCo** physics engine for their experiments, I will note that **MuJoCo** is a commonly used benchmark in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets and their citations. Here are the datasets I will include:

1. **FetchReach-v1**: This is a robotic manipulation task environment from the **OpenAI Gym** suite, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, and Ilya Sutskever. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **FetchSlide-v1**: Similar to FetchReach, this environment is also part of the OpenAI Gym suite. The citation remains the same as above.

3. **FetchPush-v1**: Another environment from the OpenAI Gym suite, with the same citation.

4. **FetchPickAndPlace-v1**: This environment is also included in the OpenAI Gym suite, and the citation is the same.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset citations beyond the environments, I will ensure to reference the OpenAI Gym citation for all the environments mentioned.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset referenced in the paper.
