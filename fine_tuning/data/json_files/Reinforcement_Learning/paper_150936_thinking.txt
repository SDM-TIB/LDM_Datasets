To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuperHF: Supervised Iterative Learning from Human Feedback" by Gabriel Mukobi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. Here, the authors mention three main sources for their question-answering datasets, specifically:

1. **Anthropic/hh-rlhf**: This includes three datasets: **red-team-attempts**, **harmless-base**, and **helpful-base**. Each dataset consists of conversations between a human and an assistant, with specific characteristics outlined for each.

2. **openai/webgpt_comparisons**: This dataset provides a distribution of non-adversarial general web queries collected from WebGPT users.

3. **yizhongw/self_instruct**: A large dataset of model-generated instructions.

I will also note that the authors mention filtering criteria for these datasets, such as excluding questions longer than 1024 characters and formatting prompts in a specific way.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **Anthropic/hh-rlhf** datasets:
  > Bai, Y., et al. (2022). *Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback*. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862.

- For **openai/webgpt_comparisons**:
  > Nakano, R., et al. (2021). *WebGPT: Browser-assisted question-answering with human feedback*. In arXiv. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09332.

- For **yizhongw/self_instruct**:
  > Wang, Y., et al. (2023). *Self-instruct: Aligning language models with self-generated instructions*. In arXiv. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
