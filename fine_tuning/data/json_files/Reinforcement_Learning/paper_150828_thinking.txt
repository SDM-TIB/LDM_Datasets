To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Timely Healthcare Interventions" by Thanveer Shaik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their framework using two datasets: **PPG-DaLiA** and **WESAD**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly describe the datasets in **section IV (Experiment)**. Here, they provide details about each dataset:

1. **PPG-DaLiA**: This dataset contains physiological and motion data from 15 subjects, recorded from both wrist-worn and chest-worn devices while performing various activities in real-life conditions.

2. **WESAD**: The WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset includes physiological signals recorded from participants during various activities, featuring multi-modal signals such as ECG, PPG, GSR, respiration, and body temperature.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PPG-DaLiA**, the citation is:
  > A. Reiss, I. Indlekofer, P. Schmidt, and K. V. Laerhoven. *Deep PPG: Large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks*. Sensors, vol. 19, p. 3079, July 2019.

- For **WESAD**, the citation is:
  > P. Schmidt, A. Reiss, R. Duerichen, C. Marberger, and K. Van Laerhoven. *Introducing WESAD, a multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection*. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pp. 400â€“408, 2018.

With this information, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
