To extract datasets from the research paper titled "USHER: Unbiased Sampling for Hindsight Experience Replay" by Liam Schramm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various robotic systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors describe the tasks and environments used for evaluation. Here, they mention several environments, which may correspond to datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

In section 6, the authors list the tasks evaluated, including:
1. **Discrete Environment**: A toy example that is analytically tractable.
2. **4-Torus with Freeze**: An environment introduced in a previous work.
3. **Car with Random Noise**: A task involving navigation with noise.
4. **Red Light**: A task where a robot must navigate a traffic light.
5. **Fetch**: A series of tasks involving robotic manipulation.
6. **Mobile Throwing Robot**: A task involving throwing a ball.
7. **Navigation on a physical mechanum robot**: A real-world deployment task.

I will check the **References section** for any citations that correspond to these environments or datasets. For example, the **4-Torus with Freeze** environment is mentioned as being introduced in a previous paper, which I will need to locate and cite properly.

After identifying the datasets or environments, I will ensure to retrieve full citations for each relevant dataset. For instance, if the **Fetch** tasks are based on a specific dataset, I will find the original source or paper that introduced it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
