To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning and Data-Generation for Syntax-Guided Synthesis" by Julian Parsert and Elizabeth Polgreen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a method for generating training data for Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) problems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Generating SyGuS Problems)**, where the authors describe their method for generating new SyGuS problems from existing SMT problems. They mention using a combination of existing benchmarks from the SyGuS competition and newly generated problems. This section is likely to contain specific datasets or references to datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Analysis of new training data)**, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the number of problems in various categories (basic, straight-line, control-flow, and unsolved) from both the old SyGuS competition dataset and the newly generated dataset. This section explicitly mentions the datasets used for evaluation.

The paper states that they used the **SyGuS LIA dataset**, which consists of 1901 problems generated through their method. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **SyGuS competition dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alur, R., Fisman, D., Singh, R., & Udupa, A. (2017). Syntax Guided Synthesis Competition. Retrieved from https://sygus.org/.

- For the **cvc5 SMT solver**, which is referenced in the context of the datasets, the citation is:
  > Barbosa, H., Barrett, C. W., Brain, M., Kremer, G., Lachnitt, H., Mann, M., Mohamed, A., et al. (2022). cvc5: A Versatile and Industrial-Strength SMT Solver. In TACAS (1), volume 13243 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 415â€“442. Springer.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **SyGuS LIA Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 1901 SyGuS problems generated from existing SMT problems using the authors' method.

2. **SyGuS Competition Dataset**: The original dataset used for benchmarking in the SyGuS competition, which includes various categories of problems.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
