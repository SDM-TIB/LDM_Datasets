To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanation Algorithms for Behavioral and Textual Data" by Yanou Ramon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses a collection of **13 datasets** for benchmarking the effectiveness and efficiency of counterfactual explanation algorithms. This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes the characteristics of the datasets used, including their types, target variables, number of instances, features, and references. This table is crucial for extracting detailed information about each dataset.

From **Table 1**, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Flickr Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting comments.
   - Citation: [36] 20 newsgroups data. http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

2. **Ecommerce Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
   - Citation: [3] Ecommerce data. https://knowledgepit.fedcsis.org/contest/view.php?id=107

3. **Airline Dataset**: Textual data for predicting sentiment.
   - Citation: [2] Airline twitter sentiment data. https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/

4. **Twitter Dataset**: Textual data for predicting topics.
   - Citation: [5] Twitter global warming data. https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/

5. **Fraud Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting fraudulent activity.
   - Citation: n.a.

6. **YahooMovies Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
   - Citation: [6] Yahoo labs movie rating data. https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com

7. **TaFeng Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting age.
   - Citation: [22] Mining skewed and sparse transaction data for personalized shopping recommendation.

8. **KDD2015 Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting dropout.
   - Citation: [4] KDD cup 2015 data. https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup

9. **20news Dataset**: Textual data for predicting atheism.
   - Citation: [1] 20 newsgroups data. http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

10. **Movielens_100k Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
    - Citation: [20] Harper, F.M., Konstan, J.A.: The movielens datasets: History and context. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst. 5(4) (2015).

11. **Facebook Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
    - Citation: n.a.

12. **Movielens_1m Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
    - Citation: [20] Harper, F.M., Konstan, J.A.: The movielens datasets: History and context. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst. 5(4) (2015).

13. **Libimseti Dataset**: Behavioral data for predicting gender.
    - Citation: [8] Brozovsky, L., Petricek, V.: Recommender system for online dating service (2007).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
