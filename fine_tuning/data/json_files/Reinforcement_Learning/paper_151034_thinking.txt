To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reliable Representation with Bidirectional Transition Model for Visual Reinforcement Learning Generalization" by Xiaobo Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **DeepMind Control suite** and **robotic manipulation and CARLA simulators**, indicating that these may be datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the specific environments they utilized. In this section, they mention using two configurations of the **DeepMind Control suite** (DMControl) for validation, which suggests that DMControl is a dataset or benchmark suite relevant to their work.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **method** sections. The authors refer to the **robotic manipulation simulator** and **CARLA**, which are also significant environments for testing their model. 

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

2. **CARLA Simulator**:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., and Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, 1–16. PMLR.

3. **Robotic Manipulation Simulator**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
