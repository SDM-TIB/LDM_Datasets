To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Offline Reinforcement Learning: Collaborative Single-Policy Coverage Suffices" by Jiin Woo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will pay close attention to any specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This is crucial for identification.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, size, and any relevant features.
3. **Citation**: I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I will look for the citation that corresponds to it, which might be something like:
> Brockman, G., et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure clarity and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
