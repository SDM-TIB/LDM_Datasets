To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible text generation for counterfactual fairness probing" by Zee Fryer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **Civil Comments dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to their research. The introduction further elaborates on the use of this dataset for testing fairness issues in text-based classifiers.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Civil Comments dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 2 million English-language internet comments from 2015-2017, with crowd-sourced toxicity annotations. It is crucial for their experiments on counterfactual generation.

2. **CivilComments-Identities (CC-I)**: This is a subset of the Civil Comments dataset, containing 450,000 comments with additional labels for references to various identities, such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, and race. This dataset is particularly important for their analysis of counterfactuals related to sensitive attributes.

I will also check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are:

- For the **Civil Comments dataset**:
  > Borkan, D., Dixon, L., Sorensen, J., Thain, N., & Vasserman, L. (2019). Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification. CoRR, abs/1903.04561.

- For the **CivilComments-Identities (CC-I)** dataset, since it is a subset of the Civil Comments dataset, I will use the same citation as above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
