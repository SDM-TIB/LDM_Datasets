To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chaos-based reinforcement learning with TD3" by Toshitaka Matsuki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that describe experimental setups or evaluations. This is where the authors are likely to detail the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving a **goal task** and a **goal change task**. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets; instead, they describe the tasks and the environments they created for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are likely generated or simulated rather than sourced from established datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or previous works are cited that could be relevant to the tasks described. This may include foundational papers in reinforcement learning or chaos-based learning that could have used datasets that are now considered standard in the field.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that could be associated with the datasets or tasks described in the paper. If the authors have created their own datasets for the experiments, I will note that as well, even if they do not provide a formal citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I document the full citations for any datasets or foundational works mentioned, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any experimental tasks and their descriptions.
3. Check the references for any relevant datasets or foundational works.
4. Compile full citations for any identified datasets or relevant references.
