To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Semantic Relationships to Prioritise Indicators of Compromise in Additive Manufacturing Systems" by Mahender Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to existing datasets.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets used for analysis. In this paper, the authors discuss the collection of threat information from multiple resources, including forums, blogs, and security news. However, I need to determine if they refer to any specific datasets or if they are using publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **related work section** for any citations of datasets used in previous studies, as this may provide context for the datasets relevant to this research. If the authors reference any datasets from other works, I will need to note those as well.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will summarize the types of data sources they refer to, such as threat intelligence feeds or specific types of indicators of compromise (IOCs), and note that these may not be formal datasets but rather sources of information.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methodology for specific datasets used.
3. Check the related work for references to datasets.
4. Look up full citations in the references section.
5. Compile the findings into a structured format with full citations for each dataset.
