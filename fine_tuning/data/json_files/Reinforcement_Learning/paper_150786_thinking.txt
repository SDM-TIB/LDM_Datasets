To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Deep Learning for Full-disk Solar Flare Prediction with Empirical Insights from Guided Grad-CAM Explanations" by Chetraj Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the type of data used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention that they used **full-disk line-of-sight solar magnetograms** obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This section will likely contain specific details about the dataset, including the number of images collected and the time frame.

In this section, the authors state that they collected **63,649 magnetogram images** from December 2010 to December 2018. They also describe how these images were labeled based on the occurrence of solar flares within a 24-hour prediction window. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the HMI instrument and the SDO, which are essential for understanding the source of the data. The citation for the HMI is:

- For **Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)**:
  > Schou, J., et al. "Design and ground calibration of the helioseismic and magnetic imager (HMI) instrument on the solar dynamics observatory (SDO)." *Solar Physics*, vol. 275, no. 1-2, pp. 229–259, Oct. 2011.

- For **Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered. The key dataset extracted from the paper is the **full-disk line-of-sight solar magnetograms**, which includes the number of images, the time frame, and the labeling criteria.

After completing this process, I will ensure that all dataset entries are accurately represented and include the full citations for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
