To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iâ€™d Like to Have an Argument, Please: Argumentative Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Adrian De Wynter and Tangming Yuan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on evaluating large language models (LLMs) for argumentative reasoning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the evaluation of LLMs but does not specify any datasets used for this evaluation.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments. In section 3.1, the authors mention using the **Review-Rebuttal Submission-v2 (RRv2)** dataset, which is a comprehensive corpus focused on argument mining (AM) and argument pair extraction (APE). This dataset contains 4,764 pairs of review and rebuttal passages related to scientific article submissions, and it is human-labeled.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the RRv2 dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces its significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RRv2 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Cheng L, Bing L, Yu Q, Lu W, Si L. *APE: Argument Pair Extraction from Peer Review and Rebuttal via Multi-task Learning*. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). Online: Association for Computational Linguistics; 2020. p. 7000-11. Available from: https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.569.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Review-Rebuttal Submission-v2 (RRv2)**: A dataset containing 4,764 pairs of review and rebuttal passages related to scientific article submissions, used for argument mining and argument pair extraction.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Cheng L, Bing L, Yu Q, Lu W, Si L. *APE: Argument Pair Extraction from Peer Review and Rebuttal via Multi-task Learning*. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). Online: Association for Computational Linguistics; 2020. p. 7000-11. Available from: https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.569.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required output structure.
