To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Ad Hoc Teamwork Research" by Reuth Mirsky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or evaluations** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Evaluation Domains)**, as this section typically outlines the various datasets or environments used for evaluation in the context of ad hoc teamwork. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or domains that have been utilized in the research.

In this section, I notice that the authors mention several evaluation domains, such as:

1. **Matrix Games**: This domain is referenced in the context of evaluating ad hoc teamwork algorithms. The citation for the relevant paper is:
   > Samuel Barrett, Peter Stone, and Sarit Kraus. *Empirical evaluation of ad hoc teamwork in the pursuit domain*. In AAMAS ’11, volume 2, pages 567–574, 2011.

2. **Predator Prey**: This domain is also mentioned as a common evaluation setting. The citation for the relevant paper is:
   > Doran Chakraborty and Peter Stone. *Cooperating with a Markovian ad hoc teammate*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, volume 1 of AAMAS ’13, pages 1085–1092. International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2013.

3. **Robot Soccer**: This domain is highlighted as a significant area for testing ad hoc teamwork. The citation for the relevant paper is:
   > Samuel Barrett and Peter Stone. *Cooperating with unknown teammates in robot soccer*. In AAAI Workshop on Multiagent Interaction without Prior Coordination, page 6, 2014.

4. **Hanabi**: This game is introduced as a new challenge for AI research, particularly in the context of ad hoc teamwork. The citation for the relevant paper is:
   > Nolan Bard et al. *The Hanabi challenge: A new frontier for AI research*. Artificial Intelligence, 280:103216, 2020.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for any further processing or review.
