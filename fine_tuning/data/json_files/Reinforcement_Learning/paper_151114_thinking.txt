To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision Making in Non-Stationary Environments with Policy-Augmented Search" by Ava Pettet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the methodologies used and often lists the datasets employed for testing the proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention using **four open-source environments from OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that these environments are the datasets of interest.

I will then identify the specific environments mentioned:
1. **Cart Pole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Frozen Lake**: An environment where an agent must navigate a slippery surface to reach a goal without falling into holes.
3. **Cliff Walking**: An environment where the agent must find a path to a goal while avoiding falling off a cliff.
4. **Lunar Lander**: An environment where the agent controls a lunar module to land safely on a landing pad.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these environments. Since these environments are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, they may not have specific citations in the paper, but I can reference the original sources for OpenAI Gym.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **OpenAI Gym**: Brockman, Greg, et al. "OpenAI Gym." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
