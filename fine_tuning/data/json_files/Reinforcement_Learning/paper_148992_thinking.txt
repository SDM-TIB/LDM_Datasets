To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matching Function Equilibria with Partial Assignment: Existence, Uniqueness and Estimation" by Liang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** of the paper, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the analysis. In this paper, the authors mention the use of data from the **1986 Current Population Survey (CPS)** and the **1987/88 Vital Statistics marriage records**. I will note these datasets and their relevance to the research.

1. **1986 Current Population Survey (CPS)**: This dataset is used to construct the observed number of available single men and women by age and education. The authors specify that they averaged the monthly CPS surveys for 22 reporting states to obtain their data.

2. **1987/88 Vital Statistics marriage records**: This dataset provides information on the flow of new marriages by age and education, which is crucial for the counterfactual analysis conducted in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used and publicly available, they may not have formal citations in the same way that journal articles do. Instead, I will document them as follows:

- For the **1986 Current Population Survey (CPS)**, I will note:
  > U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. *Current Population Survey*. 1986. Available at: [https://www.bls.gov/cps/](https://www.bls.gov/cps/).

- For the **1987/88 Vital Statistics marriage records**, I will note:
  > National Bureau of Economic Research. *Vital Statistics Marriage Records*. 1987/88. Available at: [https://www.nber.org/](https://www.nber.org/).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
