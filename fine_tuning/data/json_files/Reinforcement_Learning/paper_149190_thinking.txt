To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MHER: Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay" by Rui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup, including the datasets used. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several environments, specifically:

1. **Point2D environments**: These are likely datasets or simulated environments where the blue point must reach the green circle. I will need to confirm if these environments are publicly available datasets or custom simulations.

2. **Mujoco environments**: The paper states that experiments were conducted on Mujoco environments, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. I will check if the authors specify which Mujoco tasks were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are standard benchmarks, I will look for their original papers or documentation to ensure accurate citation.

For example, if the authors refer to the Mujoco environments, I will cite the original Mujoco paper:

- For Mujoco, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026-5033.

If the Point2D environments are derived from a specific source, I will find the corresponding citation as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
