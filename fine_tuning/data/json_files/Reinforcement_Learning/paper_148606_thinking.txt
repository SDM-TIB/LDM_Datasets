To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Purely Bayesian counterfactuals versus Newcomb’s paradox" by Lê Nguyễn Hoang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology or experiments**. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and any subsequent sections that might detail experiments or analyses involving datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses Newcomb's paradox and its implications but does not mention specific datasets. I will then look for sections that might describe experiments or analyses, particularly focusing on any **data collection or empirical analysis** sections.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author references a few studies and algorithms that utilize datasets, particularly in the context of predicting behaviors or outcomes. However, there are no specific datasets explicitly named in the text. The author discusses algorithms and their implications but does not provide concrete dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references include various studies and papers, but again, they do not specify datasets directly. 

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified in the paper.** The author discusses theoretical concepts and implications related to decision theory and Bayesian reasoning without referencing concrete datasets.

2. **Citations of related works**: While the paper references various studies, none of them are presented as datasets used for empirical analysis within this specific research.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will note the absence of specific dataset citations. This will be important for future reference or for anyone looking to replicate or build upon the research.
