To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Latents Benchmark ‘21: Evaluating latent variable models of neural population activity" by Felix Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors curated four datasets of neural spiking activity, which suggests that I will find specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (NLB ‘21: Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant characteristics of each dataset mentioned:

1. **MC_Maze**: This dataset consists of recordings from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices while a monkey performed a delayed reaching task. It includes 2,869 trials and 182 neurons.

2. **MC_RTT**: This dataset contains continuous reaching data from the primary motor cortex, with 1,351 trials and 130 neurons.

3. **Area2_Bump**: This dataset includes recordings from area 2 of the somatosensory cortex during a visually-guided reaching task, with 462 trials and 65 neurons.

4. **DMFC_RSG**: This dataset features recordings from the dorsomedial frontal cortex during a time-interval reproduction task, with 1,289 trials and 54 neurons.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper provides specific references for each dataset, which I will note down:

- For **MC_Maze**, the citation is:
  > Kaufman, M. T., Churchland, M. M., et al. (2021). Neural population dynamics during reaching. *DANDI Archive*. https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000128

- For **MC_RTT**, the citation is:
  > O’Doherty, J. E., et al. (2017). Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology. *Zenodo*. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.583331

- For **Area2_Bump**, the citation is:
  > Chowdhury, R. H., Glaser, J. E., & Miller, L. E. (2020). Area 2 of primary somatosensory cortex encodes kinematics of the whole arm. *eLife*, 9, e48198.

- For **DMFC_RSG**, the citation is:
  > Sohn, H., et al. (2019). Bayesian computation through cortical latent dynamics. *Neuron*, 103(5), 934-947.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
