To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Pedestrian Environment Model for Automated Driving" by Adrian Holzbock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate their pedestrian environment model on data generated with the **CARLA simulator** and the **nuScenes dataset**. This indicates that these two datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **evaluation section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. In section IV.A (Datasets), they explicitly describe the two datasets:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: The authors explain that CARLA is an open-source simulator for automated driving that generates diverse traffic scenes and provides matching labels for sensor data, including pedestrian skeletons. This dataset is used for simulating different traffic scenarios.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: The authors describe nuScenes as a real-world dataset collected in Boston and Singapore, which includes data from various sensors and is labeled with 3D bounding boxes and object class labels. They specifically mention using the mini-set-split of the nuScenes dataset for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CARLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., et al. (2019). nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
