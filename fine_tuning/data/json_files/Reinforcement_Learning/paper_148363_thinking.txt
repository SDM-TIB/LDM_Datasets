To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Graph Neural Networks with Experience Replay" by Fan Zhou and Chengtai Cao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets utilized for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain key details.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,708 nodes, 1,433 node attributes, and 7 total classes. It is used for node classification tasks.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,327 nodes, 3,703 node attributes, and 6 total classes, also used for node classification tasks.

3. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset is larger, with 232,965 nodes, 602 node attributes, and 41 total classes, used for a more complex 5-way node classification task.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Cora and Citeseer datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for their original sources. The Reddit dataset is also well-known, and I will ensure to find its citation as well.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **Cora Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Reddit Dataset**:
  > Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In *NIPS*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
