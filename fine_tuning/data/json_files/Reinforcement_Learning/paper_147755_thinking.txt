To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerated Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Sensitive Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensors" by Nikhilesh Sharma, Nicholas Mastronarde, and Jacob Chakareski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior studies that utilized specific datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or simulations. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods in relation to these datasets. This can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to provide accurate citations, as they allow others to locate the datasets for their own research.

If I find specific datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and the corresponding citations. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Energy Harvesting Dataset," I will look for the original source of that dataset and provide the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a clear and organized manner.
