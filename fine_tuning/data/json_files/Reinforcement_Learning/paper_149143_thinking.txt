To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keyframe-Focused Visual Imitation Learning" by Chuan Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA100 dataset**, which is a strong indication that there are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, and I will focus on sections that discuss the environments used for evaluation.

In **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CARLA100 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a photorealistic urban driving simulator dataset generated by a PID expert controller with access to simulator states. It is referenced as a standard testbed for visual imitation learning.

2. **MuJoCo-Image Datasets**: The authors mention three environments from the OpenAI Gym MuJoCo suite: **Hopper**, **HalfCheetah**, and **Walker2D**. These environments are used for continuous control tasks, and the authors specify that expert data is generated from a TRPO policy with access to true states.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CARLA100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Felipe Codevilla, Eder Santana, Antonio M. López, and Adrien Gaidon. *Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 9329–9338, 2019.

- For the **MuJoCo environments**, the citation for the original MuJoCo paper is:
  > John Schulman, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel, Michael Jordan, and Philipp Moritz. *Trust region policy optimization*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 1889–1897, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
