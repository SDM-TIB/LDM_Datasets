To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dream and Search to Control: Latent Space Planning for Continuous Control" by Anurag Koul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on continuous control benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors mention evaluating their approach on **20 control tasks from the DeepMind Control suite**. This indicates that the DeepMind Control suite is a dataset used for their experiments.

I will then look for more details about this dataset in the **references section** to ensure I can provide a full citation. The DeepMind Control suite is referenced in the paper as follows:

- **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., Liu, S., Bohez, S., Merel, J., Erez, T., Lillicrap, T., & Heess, N. (2020). *dmcontrol: Software and tasks for continuous control*. 

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used in their experiments is the DeepMind Control suite.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the DeepMind Control suite, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured output ready for review or further processing.
