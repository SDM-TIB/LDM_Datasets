To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Search for Imperfect-Information Games" by Noam Brown et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on two specific games: **heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em poker** and **Liar’s Dice**. I will note that while these games are not datasets in the traditional sense, they represent the environments in which the algorithms were tested. I will also check if there are any publicly available implementations or datasets associated with these games mentioned in the references or acknowledgments.

After identifying the datasets or game environments, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

For the poker game, I will look for any references to datasets or previous works that might have provided data for training or testing the algorithms. Similarly, for Liar’s Dice, I will check if there are any datasets or implementations referenced that could be useful for understanding the experimental setup.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or game environment mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
