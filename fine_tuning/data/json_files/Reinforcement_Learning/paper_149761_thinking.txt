To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Permutation Graph Search: Black-Box Optimization for Fairness in Ranking" by Ali Vardasbi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they aim to optimize fairness measures using various datasets. However, I need to locate specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MSLR (Microsoft Learning to Rank)**: This dataset is noted for its use in counterfactual learning to rank research and fairness studies. The authors specify that they use Fold 1 of MSLR-WEB30k, which contains 5-level relevance labels and an average of 120.19 documents per query.

2. **TREC (Text Retrieval Conference)**: The authors refer to the academic search dataset provided by the TREC Fair Ranking track for the years 2019 and 2020. They mention that TREC 2019 has 632 train queries and 635 test queries, while TREC 2020 has 200 train and 200 test queries.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets mentioned (MSLR and TREC) are well-known and typically cited in other works, so I can provide their standard citations:

- For **MSLR**, the citation is:
  > Tao Qin and Tie-Yan Liu. 2013. Introducing LETOR 4.0 datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.2597.

- For **TREC**, the citation is:
  > Asia J. Biega, Fernando Diaz, Michael D. Ekstrand, and Sebastian Kohlmeier. 2019. Overview of the TREC 2019 Fair Ranking Track. In The Twenty-Eighth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2019) Proceedings.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
