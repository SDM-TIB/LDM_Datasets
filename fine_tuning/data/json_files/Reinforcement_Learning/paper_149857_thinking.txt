To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA-GEAR: A Dataset Generator for a Systematic Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness of Vision Models" by Federico Nesti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that CARLA-GEAR generates synthetic datasets for evaluating adversarial robustness, which suggests that datasets are a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Dataset Generation)**, where the authors describe the dataset generation process in detail. Here, they mention that CARLA-GEAR can generate datasets for four specific vision tasks: semantic segmentation, 2D object detection, stereo 3D object detection, and monocular depth estimation. This section is crucial as it outlines the types of datasets produced.

The authors specify that the datasets generated include RGB images, ground truth annotations, and additional information about camera poses and billboard positions. They also mention that the datasets follow established formats for each task, such as CityScapes for semantic segmentation and COCO for 2D object detection.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors discuss the datasets used in their experiments, specifically mentioning 10 attack situations, including 9 billboard-based attacks and 1 truck-based attack. This section confirms the practical application of the datasets generated by CARLA-GEAR.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets and tools mentioned. The paper references the CARLA simulator, which is essential for generating the datasets. The citation for CARLA is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:

PMLR, 2017, pp. 1–16.

Additionally, the authors refer to the adversarial patch generation method in their work, which is cited as follows:

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset and tool mentioned. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized and generated in the research.
