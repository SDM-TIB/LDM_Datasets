To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Twin-Assisted Knowledge Distillation Framework for Heterogeneous Federated Learning" by Xiucheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a "big teacher model" and "private datasets," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using the **CIFAR-100 dataset**. They mention that they divided this dataset into IID and Non-IID sub-datasets for their experiments, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

I will also check the **results** section to confirm that the CIFAR-100 dataset is indeed used for training and testing the models. The authors provide details about how they sliced the dataset into four equal parts and how they divided it according to image categories, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset is typically as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. 

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or mentions in methodology/experiments.
3. Confirm the use of the CIFAR-100 dataset in the results section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
