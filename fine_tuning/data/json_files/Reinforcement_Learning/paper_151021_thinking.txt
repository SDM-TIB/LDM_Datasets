To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck Process to understand Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model and its Noise Schedules" by Javier E. Santos and Yen Ting Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as it typically details the datasets used for validation.

In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors mention conducting tests on **CIFAR-10**. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, particularly for image classification tasks. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its application in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly referenced in literature, so I will look for its authoritative source. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
