To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Q Network" by Jingbin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors experiment with a self-play environment called **Google Research Football (GRF)**, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or a benchmark used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the datasets or environments used. The authors specifically mention using **Google Research Football (GRF)** as a self-play environment for training their agents. This indicates that GRF is a significant dataset or environment for their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the GRF environment in detail, noting that it is an open-source reinforcement learning environment where agents learn to play football. They provide a link to the project, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google Research Football dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Google Research Football**:
  > Kurach, K., Raichuk, A., and Sta≈Ñczyk, P. (2019). *Google research football: A novel reinforcement learning environment*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.11180.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for Google Research Football, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
