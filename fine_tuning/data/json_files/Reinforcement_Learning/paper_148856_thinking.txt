To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affordance-based Reinforcement Learning for Urban Driving" by Tanmay Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments. I will check if they refer to any specific datasets associated with CARLA or if they mention any other datasets used for training or evaluation purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the CARLA simulator, I will find the citation for the original CARLA paper:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, Germán Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio López, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL, 2017.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will follow the same process to extract their names and full citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that all relevant dataset information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
