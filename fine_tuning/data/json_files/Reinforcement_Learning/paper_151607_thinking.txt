To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Price Collusion in Two-sided Markets" by Cristian Chica, Yinglong Guo, and Gilad Lerman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources used in their research. The abstract discusses algorithmic price collusion and mentions experiments, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **data sources**. This is often found in the methodology or experimental sections of research papers. If such a section exists, it will likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If there is no specific section, I will check the **methods** or **experiments** sections for any references to datasets. The authors may describe the data they used for simulations or experiments, which could include publicly available datasets or proprietary data.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. I will also check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note where it can be accessed.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
