To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating Expert Intuition into Quantifiable Features: Encode Investigator Domain Knowledge via LLM for Enhanced Predictive Analytics" by Phoebe Jing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and references sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of qualitative insights into predictive models but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to utilizing transaction data for money laundering detection. Here, they mention that investigators provide datasets highlighting transactions suspected of embodying specific patterns. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in their methodology. The references include various studies, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets that were utilized in their research.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that may correspond to datasets or methodologies related to the study:

1. **Realistic synthetic financial transactions for anti-money laundering models**:
   > Altman, Erik, Jovan Blanuša, Luc Von Niederhäusern, Béni Egressy, Andreea Anghel, and Kubilay Atasu. "Realistic synthetic financial transactions for anti-money laundering models." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).

2. **Enhancing Anti-Money Laundering: Development of a Synthetic Transaction Monitoring Dataset**:
   > Oztas, Berkan, Deniz Cetinkaya, Festus Adedoyin, Marcin Budka, Huseyin Dogan, and Gokhan Aksu. "Enhancing Anti-Money Laundering: Development of a Synthetic Transaction Monitoring Dataset." In 2023 IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE), pp. 47-54. IEEE, 2023.

These references suggest that the authors may have utilized synthetic datasets for their analysis, particularly in the context of anti-money laundering.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. Although the paper does not provide specific dataset names, the references indicate the sources of the datasets used in their methodology.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required.
