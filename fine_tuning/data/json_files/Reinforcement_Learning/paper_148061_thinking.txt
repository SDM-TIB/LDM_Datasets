To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PPO Dash: Improving Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Joe Booth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Obstacle Tower Challenge**, which suggests that this is a key dataset or environment used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 1.1 (The Obstacle Tower Environment)**, where the authors describe the environment in detail. They mention that the Obstacle Tower Environment consists of 25 floors, three visual themes, and 100 seeds that randomize the level layout. This indicates that the Obstacle Tower Environment is indeed a dataset or benchmark used for their experiments.

In **section 1.2 (The Obstacle Tower Challenge 2019 competition)**, the authors provide additional context about the competition based on the Obstacle Tower Environment, confirming its significance as a dataset for evaluating their proposed PPO-Dash improvements.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Obstacle Tower Environment and Challenge. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Obstacle Tower Environment**:
  > Juliani, A., Khalifa, A., Berges, V., Harper, J., Henry, H., Crespi, A., Togelius, J., and Lange, D. (2019). *Obstacle tower: A generalization challenge in vision, control, and planning*. CoRR, abs/1902.01378.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Obstacle Tower Environment and Challenge, I will document this as the main dataset used in the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Obstacle Tower Environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing needed.
