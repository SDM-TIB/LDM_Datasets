To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of November 21, 2021, Kaua‘i Island Power System 18–20 Hz Oscillations" by Shuan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the oscillation event and the methods used for analysis, but it does not specify any datasets directly. However, it does mention the use of measurement-based methods, which may imply the presence of data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or data sources. The introduction discusses the challenges posed by inverter-based resources (IBRs) but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their analysis methods. They mention using two measurement-based methods: the dissipating energy flow method and the sub/super-synchronous power flow method. I will look for any references to data sources or datasets used in these analyses.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the oscillation event and the data collected, including phasor data and point-on-wave data captured by digital fault recorders (DFRs). However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various papers that may contain relevant datasets or methodologies, but they do not directly cite datasets used in this study.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the methods and types of data used, they do not provide specific datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will note that the paper primarily relies on measurement data from DFRs and SCADA systems, but does not provide formal dataset citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting the lack of specific datasets with citations in the paper. If any datasets were mentioned, I would ensure to include their full citations as per the references provided in the paper. Since no explicit datasets were identified, I will document this observation clearly.
