To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football" by Jinglong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of the Google Research Football environment, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe the gaming environment. Here, they mention the **Google Research Football** environment, which is an open-source platform for training reinforcement learning agents. This is a significant dataset as it provides the framework for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will also check the **results and discussion** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to specific configurations or scenarios within the Google Research Football environment that could be considered as distinct datasets.

In the **references section**, I will look for any citations related to the Google Research Football environment. The authors cite the following paper that describes this environment:

- For **Google Research Football**, the citation is:
  > Karol Kurach, Anton Raichuk, Piotr Stanczyk, et al. "Google research football: A novel reinforcement learning environment." Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 34(04), pp. 4501-4510, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Google Research Football dataset as it is the primary dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
