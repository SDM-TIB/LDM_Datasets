To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Entropy-Maximizing TD3-based Reinforcement Learning for Automatic PID Tuning" by Myisha A. Chowdhury and Qiugang Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning for PID tuning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Simulation)**, where the authors describe their case studies. Here, they mention applying their method to a second-order process defined by a transfer function. However, they do not refer to any specific datasets or publicly available datasets for training or testing.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various works related to PID tuning and reinforcement learning, but they do not appear to reference any specific datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a novel algorithm and its application, it does not provide any datasets or references to datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
