To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Q-Learning: Offline and Online Policy Customization without Value" by Chenran Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup, including the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and their purposes in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors mention using environments from the **OpenAI Gym** and **highway-env** for their experiments. I will note these environments as they often come with associated datasets or benchmarks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets like the **CartPole** or **Continuous Mountain Car**, I will look for their original sources or any relevant papers that describe these datasets. 

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
