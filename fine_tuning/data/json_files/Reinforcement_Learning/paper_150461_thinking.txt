To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Thermoelectric Power Factor of Bismuth Telluride During Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing" by Ankita Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data about manufacturing processing parameters and in-situ sensor monitoring data collected during the additive manufacturing of Bi2Te3. This suggests that there are datasets related to these parameters and sensor data.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **3.1 Data Collection**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that they collected in-situ sensor data from two modalities: thermal tomography and polarimetry. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these sensor modalities.

In **3.1.2 Coupon Fabrication**, the authors state that they successfully manufactured a total of 220 coupons using various processing parameters. This implies that there is a dataset containing information about these coupons, including the processing parameters used for each.

In **3.1.3 In-situ Sensors**, the authors detail the types of data collected from the sensors, which includes thermal tomography data and polarimetry data. They describe how these datasets were structured, indicating that they contain images and measurements relevant to the manufacturing process.

Moving to **3.3 Dataset Preparation**, the authors mention that they considered data from 117 coupons for their analysis, resulting in a total of 3,157 sample points. This section provides insight into how the datasets were prepared and combined, which is crucial for understanding the context of the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several studies that may provide context or foundational datasets related to the thermoelectric materials and additive manufacturing processes. 

1. For the **thermal tomography data**, the citation is:
   > Basler acA4024-29um camera with a Sony IMX226 CMOS sensor. (No specific citation provided in the paper, but the camera model is mentioned.)

2. For the **polarimetry data**, the citation is:
   > Basler acA4024-29um camera with a Sony IMX226 CMOS sensor. (Again, no specific citation is provided, but the camera model is mentioned.)

3. The dataset related to the **processing parameters** and **power factor** is derived from the authors' own experiments, so it does not have an external citation but is crucial for the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
