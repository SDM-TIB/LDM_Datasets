To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Generative Ad Hoc Information Retrieval" by Lukas Gienapp et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. This is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. If there is a section explicitly labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. For instance, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will note the name and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the "TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track" dataset, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. 2020. Overview of the TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Text REtrieval Conference, TREC 2020, Virtual Event [Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA], November 16â€“20, 2020 (NIST Special Publication, Vol. 1266), Ellen M. Voorhees and Angela Ellis (Eds.). National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 13 pages.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for further use or analysis.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to confirm its accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
