To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Safe Mechanical Ventilation Treatment Using Deep Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Flemming Kondrup et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **MIMIC-III dataset** for evaluating the proposed DeepVent model, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Data extraction and pre-processing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the MIMIC-III database. They describe it as an open-access database containing data for 61,532 ICU stays at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which confirms its significance in the study.

In this section, the authors mention that they used SQL to extract patient data, including vital signs, lab values, demographics, fluids, and ventilation settings. This detailed description of how the dataset was utilized further emphasizes its importance.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the MIMIC-III dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided is:
> Johnson, A. E. W.; Pollard, T. J.; Shen, L.; Lehman, L. H.; Feng, M.; Ghassemi, M.; Moody, B.; Szolovits, P.; Anthony Celi, L.; and Mark, R. G. 2016. MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the MIMIC-III dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset is included. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
