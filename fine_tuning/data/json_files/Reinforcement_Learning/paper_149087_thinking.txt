To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable performance analysis towards offline reinforcement learning: A dataset perspective" by Chenyang Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a benchmark platform called **RL easy go (RLEG)**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors describe how they generated datasets through an online DQN agent from scratch in the Atari 2600 Games. They categorize the datasets into three subsets: **low**, **medium**, and **high** quality based on their mean episode returns. This categorization is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **subsection 4.1 (Experiment setup)**, the authors mention that they generated the dataset through an online DQN agent and provide details about the dataset's structure. They also state that they collected tuples of the form (s, a, r, s', a', r', t) for the different quality datasets. This indicates that the datasets are structured and contain specific types of information.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **future work** sections to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further context about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **RL easy go (RLEG)**: This is the benchmark platform created by the authors, which includes datasets for offline reinforcement learning experiments. The datasets are categorized into three quality levels based on their mean episode returns: low, medium, and high.

2. **Atari 2600 Games Dataset**: The authors generated this dataset through an online DQN agent. It consists of tuples (s, a, r, s', a', r', t) and is divided into three subsets based on performance metrics.

Next, I will look for full citations for any datasets mentioned in the references. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, I will note that the datasets are part of the open-source benchmark platform and refer to the paper for details.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations as follows:

- **RL easy go (RLEG)**: A benchmark platform for offline reinforcement learning, including datasets of varying quality. The datasets are open-sourced and can be accessed through the platform.
- **Atari 2600 Games Dataset**: Generated through an online DQN agent, structured as tuples (s, a, r, s', a', r', t) and categorized into low, medium, and high quality based on mean episode returns.

I will ensure that the information is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
