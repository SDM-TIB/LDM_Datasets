To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Asset Allocation" by Adebayo Oshingbesan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction may elaborate on their significance in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Chapter 7), where the authors typically describe the data used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and the time period they cover. For instance, the authors mention using **Dow Jones 30** data, which consists of daily stock data from January 2011 to November 2021.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from other studies or sources. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **Dow Jones 30 dataset**, I will note the following details:
- **Dataset Name**: Dow Jones 30
- **Description**: Daily stock data from 30 blue-chip publicly traded U.S. companies.
- **Time Period**: January 2011 to November 2021.
- **Usage**: 70% of the data was used for training, while 30% was used for testing the RL agents.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section. The citation for the Dow Jones 30 dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is a commonly used financial dataset and may not have a specific citation.

After gathering all relevant information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations.
