To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Complexity of Variance-reduced Distributionally Robust Q-learning" by Shengbo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their content, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or any specific characteristics that define the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to reinforcement learning or specific benchmarks relevant to their algorithms. I will look for mentions of datasets like the OpenAI Gym, Atari games, or any other standard datasets in the reinforcement learning community.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
