To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overview of the TREC 2022 NeuCLIR Track" by Dawn Lawrie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the main topics and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the TREC Neural CLIR track and the use of various datasets for cross-language information retrieval, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss several datasets that are relevant to the tasks of the NeuCLIR track. Specifically, I will focus on sections that describe the tasks and the resources used, as these often contain explicit references to datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is mentioned as a resource that has led to rapid advances in monolingual information retrieval and has translations available for training CLIR systems.

2. **CLIRMatrix**: This dataset is highlighted as a large collection of bilingual and multilingual datasets for cross-lingual information retrieval.

3. **HC4**: This dataset is referenced as a collection built over three years of Common Crawl data in the same three languages (Chinese, Persian, and Russian).

4. **WikiCLIR**: This dataset is noted as another resource that could be useful for training neural CLIR models.

5. **MIRACL**: This dataset is also mentioned as a resource for training CLIR systems.

Next, I will ensure to find the full citations for these datasets. I will check the **References section** of the paper to locate the complete citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I find are as follows:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
