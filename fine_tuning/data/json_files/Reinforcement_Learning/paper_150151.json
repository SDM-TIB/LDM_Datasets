        "dcterms:description": "The Deep Sea environment encapsulates some of the hardest challenges associated with exploration: there is only one optimal action trajectory. The probability of finding the optimal trajectory through random action selection decays exponentially with the size of the environment. Every transition in the direction of the goal receives a negative reward that is negligible in comparison to the goal reward, but is otherwise the only reward the agent sees discouraging exploration in the direction that leads to the goal.",
