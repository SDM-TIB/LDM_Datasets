To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampling Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning through Preference-Guided Stochastic Exploration" by Wenhui Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the environments used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the application of their proposed method. They mention testing their algorithm in **nine different environments**, which suggests that these environments may correspond to datasets or benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets or environments used for evaluation. The authors explicitly state that they tested their method in **two classes of environments: Classic Control tasks and Atari games**. This indicates that the datasets are likely the environments from the OpenAI Gym suite.

I will then compile the names of the environments mentioned:

1. **Classic Control Tasks**:
   - CartPole
   - MountainCar
   - Acrobot

2. **Atari Games**:
   - Alien
   - Pong
   - Berzerk
   - CrazyClimber
   - FishingDerby
   - Amidar

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments. Since the paper uses environments from the OpenAI Gym, I will refer to the original OpenAI Gym paper for citation:

- For the OpenAI Gym, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will create entries for each dataset based on the environments identified, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
