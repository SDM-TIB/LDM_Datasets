To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with REINFORCE" by Junzi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, types of data, etc.).

If the paper includes a dedicated **datasets** section, I will focus on that section for comprehensive details about each dataset. This section typically outlines the datasets' characteristics, their sources, and how they were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning tasks, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all datasets are clearly documented with their respective citations.
