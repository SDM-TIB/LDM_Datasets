To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy-Step Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning" by Yuhui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on a series of standard benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that first. If not, I will check the methodology and experimental setup descriptions for any references to datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several benchmark datasets in their experiments. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **MinAtar Games**: This is a collection of environments designed for reinforcement learning experiments, which is mentioned in the experiments section as a benchmark for evaluating their proposed methods.

2. **Gym**: The paper references OpenAI's Gym as another benchmark for testing their algorithms, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research.

3. **Pygame Learning Environment (PLE)**: This is also mentioned as part of the experimental setup, providing additional environments for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MinAtar Games**, the citation is:
  > Kenny Young and Tian Tian. *Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for more efficient reinforcement learning experiments*. 2019.

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

- For **Pygame Learning Environment (PLE)**, the citation is:
  > Norman Tasfi. *Pygame Learning Environment*. 2016. Available at: https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
