To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lucid Dreaming for Experience Replay: Refreshing Past States with the Current Policy" by Yunshu Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the implementation of a new framework (LiDER) and mentions its application in Atari 2600 games, which suggests that datasets related to these games might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. Here, they mention evaluating LiDER on six Atari 2600 games: **Gopher, NameThisGame, Alien, Ms. Pac-Man, Freeway, and Montezuma’s Revenge**. This indicates that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. Since these games are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, I can refer to the original sources or relevant papers that describe these datasets:

1. **Atari 2600 Games**: The citation for the Atari 2600 games is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Srinivasan, S., Ostrovski, G., Schaul, T., Saxton, D., & Munos, R. (2016). Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (Vol. 29, pp. 1471-1479). URL: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/file/afda332245e2af431fb7b672a68b659d-Paper.pdf

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Atari 2600 Games**: Gopher, NameThisGame, Alien, Ms. Pac-Man, Freeway, and Montezuma’s Revenge, with the citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
