To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Task Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Sibo Gai and Donglin Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the continual learning problem in offline reinforcement learning, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for offline datasets in the context of single-task continual learning, indicating that datasets will likely be mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention using three offline datasets: **Hopper**, **HalfCheetah**, and **Walker2D**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they use datasets from a previous work, which is crucial for citation purposes. I will need to refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant reference is:

- For the datasets used (Hopper, HalfCheetah, Walker2D), the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. ArXiv.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Hopper**: An offline reinforcement learning dataset used for training agents in a simulated environment.
2. **HalfCheetah**: Another offline dataset that focuses on the locomotion of a half-cheetah robot in a simulated environment.
3. **Walker2D**: A dataset that involves a 2D walking robot, also used for offline reinforcement learning tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper.
