To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Play in a Day: Faster Deep Reinforcement Learning by Optimality Tightening" by Frank S. He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on the **Arcade Learning Environment**, which suggests that this is a dataset or a collection of datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of deep reinforcement learning and mentions the **Arcade Learning Environment** again, reinforcing its significance in the study.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in the evaluations. The authors explicitly state that they evaluate their algorithm on **49 games from the Arcade Learning Environment**. This indicates that the dataset consists of multiple games, but I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets or subsets mentioned.

In the **experiments** section, the authors detail their evaluation methodology and confirm that they are using the **Arcade Learning Environment** as their primary dataset. They do not mention any other datasets, which simplifies the extraction process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 2013.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry. The only dataset identified is the Arcade Learning Environment, which encompasses the 49 games used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
