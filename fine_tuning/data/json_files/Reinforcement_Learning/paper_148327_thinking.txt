To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Asynchronous Policy Evaluation in Distributed Reinforcement Learning over Networks" by Xingyu Sha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly described. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and parallel reinforcement learning (RL). They mention using a **real networked MARL problem** and a **mountaincar task** for their experiments. I will need to identify if these tasks correspond to specific datasets or if they are derived from existing datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using a **trajectory experience dataset** for the MARL problem, which consists of states, actions, and rewards collected from agents. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which may indicate that it is a custom dataset generated for the purpose of their experiments.

For the mountaincar task, the authors state that the data volume is divided among nodes, but again, they do not specify a dataset name. This suggests that the dataset may be a standard benchmark used in reinforcement learning, but I will need to confirm this by checking the references or related works cited in the paper.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. If the authors refer to standard datasets or previous works that provide datasets, I will note those citations as well.

After gathering all the information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets mentioned, whether they are custom datasets or standard benchmarks.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit dataset descriptions.
3. Identify any custom datasets or standard benchmarks used in the experiments.
4. Check the references for any cited datasets or related works.
5. Document the findings with full citations for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
