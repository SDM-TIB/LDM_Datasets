To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Value Learning: A General Framework for Learning with Learning Awareness" by Tim Cooijmans, Milad Aghajohari, and Aaron Courville, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss multi-agent reinforcement learning and refer to various games, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their method's evaluation on four environments, including the **Logistic Game** and several **matrix games** (Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, Iterated Matching Pennies, and Chicken Game). However, they do not mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation, as these games are likely simulated environments rather than datasets derived from real-world data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references to previous works. The references include various papers related to multi-agent learning and reinforcement learning, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed these steps:
1. Identify the sections where datasets are likely to be mentioned (abstract, introduction, methods, experiments).
2. Extract the names and descriptions of the datasets.
3. Look for citations in the references section to provide full citations for each dataset.

In this case, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none identified in the paper.
