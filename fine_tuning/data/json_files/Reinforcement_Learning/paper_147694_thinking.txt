To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Natural Language Action Space" by Ji He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on two popular text games, which suggests that datasets related to these games are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the two text games used for evaluation: **"Saving John"** and **"Machine of Death."** I will look for specific details about these games, such as their characteristics, statistics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for both games, including the vocabulary size, action vocabulary size, average words per description, state transitions, and the number of states. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the games as being from a public archive, which is important for proper citation.

For the game **"Saving John,"** I will note the following details:
- **Game Type**: Choice
- **Vocab Size**: 1762
- **Action Vocab Size**: 171
- **Avg. Words/Description**: 76.67
- **State Transitions**: Deterministic
- **# of States**: 70

The citation for this game is:
> Adams, E. (2014). *Fundamentals of game design*. Pearson Education.

For the game **"Machine of Death,"** I will note:
- **Game Type**: Choice & Hypertext
- **Vocab Size**: 2258
- **Action Vocab Size**: 419
- **Avg. Words/Description**: 67.80
- **State Transitions**: Stochastic
- **# of States**: 200

The citation for this game is:
> Adams, E. (2014). *Fundamentals of game design*. Pearson Education.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
