To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Appraisal Theories for Emotion Classification in Text" by Jan Hofmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors make their corpus of appraisal-annotated emotion-associated event descriptions publicly available, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the **enISEAR corpus**, which is a key dataset they utilize. The introduction mentions that this corpus contains 1001 English event descriptions labeled with discrete emotion categories.

I will then check the **corpus section** (Section 3) for detailed descriptions of the dataset. Here, the authors provide specifics about the enISEAR corpus, including its size, the nature of the data, and the emotions it covers (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, joy, sadness, and shame). This section confirms that the dataset is indeed the focus of their study.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the enISEAR corpus. The authors reference the original creators of the ISEAR project, which is foundational to the enISEAR corpus. The citation I need is:

- For the **enISEAR corpus**, the citation is:
  > Klaus R. Scherer and Harald G. Wallbott. *ISEAR questionnaire materials and online research*. Geneva Emotion Research Group, 1997. Available at: https://www.unige.ch/cisa/research/materials-and-online-research/research-material/.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **enISEAR corpus**: A dataset of 1001 English event descriptions annotated with discrete emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, joy, sadness, and shame).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.
