To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning in Mixed Systems through Augmented Samples and Its Applications to Queueing Networks" by Honghao Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used for validation and testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of reinforcement learning in mixed systems and mention various applications, including queueing networks. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources. 

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors conducted experiments on multiple queueing network applications. They mention using a **Criss-Cross Network** and a **Wireless Downlink Network** as case studies. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in this section.

To ensure I have not missed any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide datasets. I will look for any papers that might have introduced or used datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers related to reinforcement learning and queueing networks, but they do not provide specific datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the applications mentioned:

1. **Criss-Cross Network**: This is a conceptual model used in the experiments, but no specific dataset is provided. The authors describe the network's structure and parameters but do not cite a dataset.

2. **Wireless Downlink Network**: Similar to the Criss-Cross Network, this is another application context used in the experiments without a specific dataset citation.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or citations, I will note that the experiments are based on simulated environments rather than publicly available datasets.

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

- **Criss-Cross Network**: No specific dataset citation provided; the network is a conceptual model used for experiments.
- **Wireless Downlink Network**: No specific dataset citation provided; the network is a conceptual model used for experiments.

I will ensure to mention that the experiments rely on simulated environments rather than specific datasets, which is an important detail for anyone reviewing the paper's methodology.
