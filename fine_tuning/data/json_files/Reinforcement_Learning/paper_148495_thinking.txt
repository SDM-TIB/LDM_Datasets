To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Imitation Learning via Generalized Lower Bound Q-learning" by Yunhao Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention using **benchmark tasks** for evaluation, specifically referring to "state-based continuous control" tasks. They list several tasks such as **Walker, Cheetah, and Ant**, which are likely derived from specific datasets or simulation environments. I will need to confirm if these tasks correspond to established datasets or if they are part of a simulation framework.

After identifying the tasks, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets or simulation environments. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, if the tasks are from the OpenAI Gym or DeepMind Control Suite, I will look for the appropriate references in the bibliography.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will involve formatting the information clearly, specifying the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and correctly formatted for inclusion in any subsequent documentation or analysis.
