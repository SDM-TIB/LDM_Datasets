To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the sample-efficiency of neural architecture search with reinforcement learning" by Attila Nagy and Ábel Boros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will specifically look for a subsection titled **"Dataset"** or similar, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section should provide details such as the dataset name, its characteristics, and how it was utilized in the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification. They describe it as consisting of 60,000 32x32 RGB images categorized into 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for validation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the style used in the paper, and it is crucial to include it for proper attribution.

The full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A standard benchmark dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 RGB images categorized into 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for validation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
