To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Robust Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty" by Yue Wang and Shaofeng Zou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or specific environments.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **related work section** and **references** for any citations that might refer to datasets used in previous studies. This could provide context or lead to the identification of datasets that are foundational to the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official title or commonly used name.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., images, videos, tabular data) and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset named "OpenAI Gym," I would document it as follows:
- **Name**: OpenAI Gym
- **Description**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, providing various environments for testing.
- **Full citation**: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented and formatted consistently, ready for inclusion in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all relevant citations are accurately captured. This thorough approach will help ensure that the dataset extraction is comprehensive and reliable.
