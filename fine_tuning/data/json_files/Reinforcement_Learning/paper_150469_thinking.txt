To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning for Fast Roaming in IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi Systems" by Ting-Hui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or simulation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context and significance of their work. I will look for any references to datasets that may have been used in prior studies or that are relevant to their proposed algorithm.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the parts discussing the simulation setup and experiments, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors mention using "realistic datasets" to enhance the authenticity of their simulations, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their names and details.

I will also check the **performance evaluations section** to see if the authors provide any additional information about the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains insights into how the datasets were utilized and their relevance to the results presented.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Based on the content of the paper, I will look for the following datasets:

1. **ns-3 Network Simulator**: The authors mention using this simulator to emulate real-time Wi-Fi channel scanning and roaming. I will check if there is a specific dataset associated with this simulator that they reference.

2. **Channel State Information (CSI)**: The paper discusses collecting CSI data, including RSSI, SNR, and throughput. I will look for any specific datasets or sources from which this data was derived.

3. **Realistic Datasets**: The authors refer to practical datasets to enhance their simulations. I will need to identify what these datasets are and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as per the standards of academic referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
