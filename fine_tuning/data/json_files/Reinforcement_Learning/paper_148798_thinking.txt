To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantization of Acoustic Model Parameters in Automatic Speech Recognition Framework" by Amrutha Prasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of parameter quantization on word recognition performance and mentions the use of a standard setup, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Librispeech** dataset, which is a well-known corpus for automatic speech recognition tasks. The paper states that the experiments are performed on Librispeech, which consists of approximately 1000 hours of 16 kHz read English speech.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors provide more details about the Librispeech dataset, confirming that it is used for training the acoustic models. They also mention that the language model (LM) is trained on Librispeech data, which further emphasizes its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Librispeech dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Librispeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Librispeech Dataset**: A corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16 kHz read English speech from the LibriVox project, used for training and evaluating automatic speech recognition systems.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
