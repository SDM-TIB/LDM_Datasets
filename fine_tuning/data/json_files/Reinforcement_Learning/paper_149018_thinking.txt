To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Controller for Active Heave Compensation" by Shrenik Zinage and Abhilash Somayajula, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may mention the context or previous works that used certain datasets, which could be useful.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there is no explicit section titled "Datasets," but the methodology and results sections may contain references to any datasets used for training or testing the reinforcement learning model.

I will pay close attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize the data used in simulations or experiments. For instance, the paper discusses the simulation results and compares the performance of the RL controller against a PD controller, which may imply the use of specific datasets or simulation parameters.

In the **results section**, the authors present various performance metrics and comparisons across different sea states. While they do not explicitly mention datasets, they refer to the conditions under which the simulations were run, such as "moderate sea state" and "very rough sea state." I will note these conditions as they may relate to the datasets used in the simulations.

After gathering all relevant information, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may have provided datasets or methodologies that the authors built upon. This could lead to identifying the original sources of any datasets used.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered and ensure to write the full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that as well.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for any datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or related work referenced in the paper.
