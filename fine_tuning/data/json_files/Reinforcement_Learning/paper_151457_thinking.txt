To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Operator Enabled Digital Twin Modeling for Additive Manufacturing" by Ning Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses a digital twin framework and mentions the use of data generated from high-fidelity physics-based models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Physics-Based Modeling)**, where the authors describe the physics-based process simulation. Here, they mention creating a database based on simulations, which indicates that a dataset is being generated. I will look for specific details about this dataset, including its structure and contents.

In **section 3 (Neural Operator Enabled Physics Surrogates)**, the authors detail the training of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and mention conducting a total of 750 simulations with various parameters. This section is crucial as it likely contains the specifics of the datasets used for training the models. I will extract the parameters used (laser power, scan speed, substrate temperature, and laser absorptivity) and the resulting temperature fields, which form the dataset.

I will also check **section 5 (Virtual Demonstration)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup and the data collected during the experiments. This section may provide additional datasets related to the physical experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Based on my findings, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation.
