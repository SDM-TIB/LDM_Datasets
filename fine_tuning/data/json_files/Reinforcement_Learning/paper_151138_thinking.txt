To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning with Decision Transformer" by Kaixin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on **MoJuCo** and **Meta-World benchmarks**, indicating that these may be the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of continual offline reinforcement learning and mentions the use of **MoJuCo** and **Meta-World** as benchmarks, confirming their relevance.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that lists the datasets used. The paper mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **MoJuCo** and **Meta-World**, providing further confirmation of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced or if there are specific details about how these datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **MoJuCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2012.

2. **Meta-World**: The citation for the Meta-World benchmark is:
   > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-World: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1094â€“1100. PMLR, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
