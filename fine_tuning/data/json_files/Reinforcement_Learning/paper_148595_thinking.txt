To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Research on Fitness Function of Two Evolution Algorithms Using for Neutron Spectrum Unfolding" by Rui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract mentions the use of "four neutron spectra selected from IAEA 403 report," which indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors discuss the neutron spectra used for unfolding. They specifically mention that they selected four reference neutron spectra with different shapes and continuity from the IAEA 403 report. This is a crucial detail that confirms the existence of datasets.

I will then look for any tables or figures that might provide additional details about these datasets. In this case, the paper refers to "four reference neutron spectra" and provides a description of their characteristics, but does not name them individually. However, it is clear that these spectra are derived from the IAEA 403 report.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the IAEA 403 report is:

- **IAEA 403**: 
  > IAEA, Compendium of Neutron Spectra and Detector Responses for Radiation Protection Purposes, No. 403, 2001.

Since the paper does not provide specific names for the four neutron spectra, I will refer to them generically as "Reference Neutron Spectrum 1," "Reference Neutron Spectrum 2," "Reference Neutron Spectrum 3," and "Reference Neutron Spectrum 4" for clarity in my documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IAEA report as the source of these datasets. Each dataset will be described with its characteristics as mentioned in the paper.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that accurately reflects the datasets referenced in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
