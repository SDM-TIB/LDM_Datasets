To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REVALUED: REGULARISED ENSEMBLE VALUE-DECOMPOSITION FOR FACTORISABLE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES" by David Ireland and Giovanni Montana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for benchmarking their proposed method. In this section, they mention that they benchmark their algorithm, REValueD, on the **discretised versions of the DeepMind Control Suite tasks**. This indicates that the DeepMind Control Suite is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the DeepMind Control Suite in the context of their experiments, so I will look for the original source of this dataset.

The citation for the DeepMind Control Suite is:
> Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *dm control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6:100022, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DeepMind Control Suite.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
