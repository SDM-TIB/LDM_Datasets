To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SOLO: Search Online, Learn Offline for Combinatorial Optimization Problems" by Joel Oren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two combinatorial optimization problems: **Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP)** and **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**. I will look for specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these problems.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the parameters and configurations for their experiments. They mention that they compare their method against known baselines, which may indicate the datasets used for these comparisons. I will note any specific datasets or benchmarks referenced.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP)**, the authors refer to a public set of benchmark problems, specifically citing:
- **Kramer, A.; Iori, M.; and Lacomme, P. (2021). Mathematical formulations for scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines with family setup times and total weighted completion time minimization. EJOR 289(3): 825â€“840.**

For the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**, they mention using a known set of benchmarks, which includes:
- **Dantzig, G. B.; and Ramser, J. H. (1959). The Truck Dispatching Problem. Manage. Sci. 6(1).**

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations to ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary information for future reference or processing.
