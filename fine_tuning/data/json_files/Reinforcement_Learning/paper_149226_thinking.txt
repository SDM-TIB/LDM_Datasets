To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Improved Algorithm of Robot Path Planning in Complex Environment Based on Double DQN" by Fei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. However, it does mention the use of simulations, which could imply the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context and background of their research. Here, they mention the limitations of existing algorithms and the improvements they propose, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will then examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the proposed algorithm. The authors mention that they generated grid maps for path planning with random settings of start points, end points, and free points. This indicates that the authors created their own datasets for the experiments, rather than using pre-existing datasets.

In this section, I will look for any specific details about the grid maps, such as the number of maps generated, the parameters used, and any variations in the datasets. The authors mention generating 300 maps, with 100 used for training and 200 for testing. This information is crucial for documenting the datasets.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the methodologies or algorithms referenced in the paper. While the authors may not cite specific datasets, they do reference foundational works that inform their approach.

The key points to document for the datasets are:
1. **Grid Maps Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300 generated grid maps for path planning, with specific configurations for start and end points and obstacles. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is generated as part of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe the dataset and its characteristics. Since the dataset is original and not published elsewhere, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the purposes of this research.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations from the paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
