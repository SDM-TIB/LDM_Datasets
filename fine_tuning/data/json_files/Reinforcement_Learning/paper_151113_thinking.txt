To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Q-Learning based Smart Scheduling of EVs for Demand Response in Smart Grids" by Viorica Rozina Chifu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **materials and methods**. In this paper, the relevant information about the datasets is likely to be found in the **Evaluation results** section, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments.

In the **Evaluation results** section, the authors mention a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) that includes specific attributes such as vehicle ID, model, battery power, battery capacity, connector type, and state of charge. This indicates that there is a structured dataset being utilized for the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to existing datasets or studies that provide the data they used. 

For the dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the key details:

1. **Dataset of Electric Vehicles**: The paper describes a dataset that includes various types of electric vehicles, specifically:
   - Renault ZOE with a battery capacity of 22 kWh and a maximum charge power of 22 kW.
   - Renault ZOE with a battery capacity of 41 kWh and a maximum charge power of 22 kW.
   - Nissan LEAF with a battery capacity of 24 kWh and a maximum charge power of 7 kW.

Next, I will look for any references that provide a full citation for this dataset. If the dataset is derived from existing literature, I will ensure to include the original source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
