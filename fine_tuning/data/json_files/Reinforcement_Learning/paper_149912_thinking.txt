To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MKIoU Loss: Towards Accurate Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images" by Xinyi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three publicly available aerial image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DOTA1.0**: This dataset is described as containing 2,806 images and 188,282 instances across 15 categories, specifically designed for oriented object detection in aerial images.

2. **UCAS_AOD**: This dataset consists of 1,510 images with 14,596 instances, focusing on cars and airplanes.

3. **HRSC2016**: This dataset includes 1,061 images with 2,976 instances, specifically for ship detection.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DOTA1.0**, the citation is:
  > Xia, G. S., Bai, X., Ding, J., et al. "DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 3974-3983.

- For **UCAS_AOD**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, H., Chen, X., Dai, W., et al. "Orientation robust object detection in aerial images using deep convolutional neural network." In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2015, pp. 3735-3739.

- For **HRSC2016**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Yuan, L., Weng, L., et al. "A high resolution optical satellite image dataset for ship recognition and some new baselines." In International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods, 2017, pp. 324-331.

Now that I have identified and confirmed the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
