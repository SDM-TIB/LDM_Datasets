To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directional Primitives for Uncertainty-Aware Motion Estimation in Urban Environments" by Ransalu Senanayake et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using both simulated and real-world urban driving datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section IV)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Carla simulator** for simulation data and two real-world datasets: the **Stanford Drone dataset** and the **Lankershim segment of the NGSIM dataset**. I will note these datasets and look for further details about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **Stanford Drone Dataset**: This dataset contains aerial trajectories of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users. It is crucial for understanding interactions in urban environments.

2. **NGSIM Lankershim Dataset**: This dataset includes trajectories of vehicles on highways in the US, which is essential for modeling vehicle behavior in traffic scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Drone Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Robicquet, A. Sadeghian, A. Alahi, and S. Savarese. "Learning social etiquette: Human trajectory understanding in crowded scenes." In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, Springer, 2016, pp. 549â€“565.

- For the **NGSIM Lankershim Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Alexiadis, J. Colyar, J. Halkias, R. Hranac, and G. McHale. "The next generation simulation program." *Journal of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)*, vol. 74, no. 8, p. 22, 2004.

I will ensure to include these full citations in the dataset descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
