To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reactive Reinforcement Learning in Asynchronous Environments" by Jaden Travnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of reactive reinforcement learning algorithms and their application in asynchronous environments, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe two experiments involving a robotic arm. The first experiment involves a stopping task, and the second experiment involves a human-robot interaction task. However, the paper does not mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation; instead, it describes the experimental setup and tasks performed by the robotic arm.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might have been used in the experiments. The references primarily consist of papers discussing reinforcement learning algorithms and robotic systems, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any named datasets or references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present.

In summary, my steps included:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the experiments section for any datasets used.
3. Checking the references for any external datasets cited.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not create any entries or citations.
