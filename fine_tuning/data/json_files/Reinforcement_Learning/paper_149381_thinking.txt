To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning" by Ilya Kostrikov, Ashvin Nair, and Sergey Levine, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on **D4RL**, which is a standard benchmark for offline reinforcement learning. This indicates that D4RL is likely a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in Section 5, where they evaluate their method on various tasks from the D4RL benchmark. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in this section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several specific datasets used for evaluation, particularly in the context of the D4RL benchmark. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **D4RL MuJoCo Datasets**: This includes various tasks such as `halfcheetah-medium-v2`, `hopper-medium-v2`, and others. These datasets are used for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms in simulated environments.

2. **Ant Maze Datasets**: The paper specifically mentions several tasks within the Ant Maze environment, such as `antmaze-umaze-v0`, `antmaze-medium-play-v0`, and others. These datasets are crucial for testing the algorithm's ability to perform multi-step dynamic programming.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The D4RL benchmark is referenced in the paper, and I will find the corresponding citation:

- For **D4RL**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, OÔ¨År Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for further processing or review.
