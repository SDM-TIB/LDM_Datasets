To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Drive from a World on Rails" by Dian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 5, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were collected or utilized in the study.

From my reading of section 5, I note that the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments. They specify that they collected a dataset consisting of **1 million frames** corresponding to roughly **69 hours of driving**. They also mention a smaller dataset of **2400 frames** used for training the ego-vehicle forward model.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CARLA simulator is referenced, and I will ensure to include its citation as it is a significant part of the dataset used in the research.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. 

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1 million frames collected from the CARLA simulator, which includes various driving scenarios under different weather conditions. It is used for training the driving policy and evaluating its performance.

2. **Small Training Dataset**: A smaller dataset of 2400 frames was used to train the ego-vehicle forward model, which learns from random actions.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
