To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Step Reinforcement Learning: A Unifying Algorithm" by Kristopher De Asis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could lead me to relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors describe experiments conducted on various environments, such as the **19-State Random Walk**, **Stochastic Windy Gridworld**, and **Mountain Cliff**. I will note these environments as they are integral to the experiments, but I need to confirm if they are publicly available datasets or if they are custom environments created for the study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if the authors cite any datasets or previous works that provide datasets. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for any datasets mentioned.

For the environments mentioned:
1. **19-State Random Walk**: This is a custom environment created for the study, so it does not have a formal citation.
2. **Stochastic Windy Gridworld**: This environment is based on a standard gridworld task described by Sutton and Barto (1998). The citation for this foundational work is:
   > Sutton, R. S., and Barto, A. G. 1998. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.
3. **Mountain Cliff**: This is a variant of the classical Mountain Car task, also described by Sutton and Barto (1998). The same citation applies here.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clear and concise, providing enough detail for someone to understand the context and relevance of each dataset in relation to the experiments conducted in the paper.
