To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaZero-Inspired Game Learning: Faster Training by Using MCTS Only at Test Time" by Johannes Scheiermann and Wolfgang Konen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to several complex games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the games they applied their method to. They mention three games: **Othello**, **ConnectFour**, and **Rubik’s Cube**. I will look for any specific datasets or resources related to these games.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about their experiments with these games, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they reference existing programs and frameworks used for their experiments, such as **Edax** for Othello and **Alpha-Beta search agents** for ConnectFour. I will need to check the references for these programs to find their respective citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets or programs mentioned:

1. For **Edax**, the citation is:
   > R. Delorme, “Edax, version 4.4,” 2019, retrieved Dec-29-2021. Available: https://github.com/abulmo/edax-reversi.

2. For **Alpha-Beta search agents**, the citation is:
   > M. Thill, S. Bagheri, P. Koch, and W. Konen, “Temporal difference learning with eligibility traces for the game Connect-4,” in International Conf on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG), Dortmund, 2014, pp. 1–8.

3. For the **General Board Game (GBG) framework**, the citation is:
   > W. Konen, “General board game playing for education and research in generic AI game learning,” in Conference on Games (London), 2019, pp. 1–8. Available: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06508.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited with the full citation provided. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or use.
