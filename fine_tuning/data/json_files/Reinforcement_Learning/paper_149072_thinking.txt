To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive landscapes hidden beneath biological cellular automata" by Lars Koopmans and Hyun Youk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses energy landscapes and cellular automata but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various modeling approaches and challenges in biological systems but do not reference specific datasets. I will continue to the **methods and results sections** to look for any datasets used in their analysis or experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any mention of datasets. If the authors describe any experiments involving data collection or analysis, they may reference specific datasets. 

I will also look for a **datasets section** if it exists, as this is a common place for authors to summarize the datasets they used. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other studies.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution. I will look for the following details for each dataset:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation as it appears in the references section

Once I have gathered all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
