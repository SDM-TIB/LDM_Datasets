To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qualitative Differences Between Evolutionary Strategies and Reinforcement Learning Methods for Control of Autonomous Agents" by Nicola Milano and Stefano Nolfi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the algorithms being compared but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using various environments for their experiments, specifically referring to the **Pybullet environments** and the **Atari environments**. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these environments.

I will also look for any **appendices or references** that might list datasets or environments used in the experiments. The references section includes citations for various algorithms and tools but does not explicitly list datasets. 

Since the paper mentions the use of environments like **Hopper, Walker2D, Bipedal Hardcore, and Slime Volley**, I will need to find the authoritative citations for these environments. The paper references the **Pybullet** physics simulation module and the **OpenAI Gym** for the Atari environments, which are crucial for replicating the experiments.

Now, I will compile the relevant citations for the environments mentioned:

1. **Pybullet**:
   > Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2016). Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning. Retrieved from http://pybullet.org, 2016â€“2019.

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for the specific environments used in the experiments. The paper does not provide individual dataset citations for the environments like Hopper or Walker2D, but they are part of the Pybullet suite.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation for future reference.

In conclusion, I will create entries for the datasets based on the environments used in the experiments, ensuring to include the relevant citations for Pybullet and OpenAI Gym, as these are the primary sources for the datasets utilized in the research.
