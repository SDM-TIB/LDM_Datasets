To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Predictive Control with Self-supervised Representation Learning" by Jonas Matthies et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for specific mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the TD-MPC framework and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using environments from the **DeepMind Control suite (DMControl)** for their experiments. This indicates that the DMControl suite is a dataset or benchmark they utilized.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DeepMind Control suite. The citation is as follows:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T.P., Riedmiller, M.A.: DeepMind control suite. CoRR abs/1801.00690 (2018).

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to various tasks within the DMControl suite, such as **Cheetah Run**, **Finger Turn Hard**, and **Reacher Easy**. However, these are specific tasks rather than separate datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **DeepMind Control suite** is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the DeepMind Control suite, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the DeepMind Control suite as the primary dataset used.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the DeepMind Control suite from the references.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and completeness.
