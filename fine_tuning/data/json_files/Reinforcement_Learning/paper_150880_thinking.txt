To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Incremental Learning Using Generative Experience Replay Based on Time-Aware Regularization" by Zizhao Hu and Mohammad Rostami, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of generative experience replay and mentions "experimental results on major benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of class-incremental learning and references existing methods, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **MNIST**, **permMNIST**, and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their research.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: 
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

3. **Permuted MNIST Dataset**: 
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. (The permuted version is a variant of the original MNIST dataset, often used in continual learning tasks.)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
