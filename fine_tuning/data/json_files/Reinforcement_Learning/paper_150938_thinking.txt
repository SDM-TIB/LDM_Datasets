To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Humanâ€“AI Knowledge Gap: Concept Discovery and Transfer in AlphaZero" by Lisa Schut et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide context about how the datasets were used.

In this paper, I notice that there are several datasets mentioned, including:

1. **Piece Dataset**: This dataset contains paired chess positions that either contain or do not contain specific chess pieces. It is used to identify the presence of pieces like rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and pawns.

2. **Stockfish Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using the Stockfish engine to evaluate chess positions based on various concepts. It includes positions that are categorized based on their strategic or tactical relevance.

3. **Strategic Test Suite (STS) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15 different categories of chess puzzles designed to capture various strategic themes.

4. **Opening Dataset**: This dataset includes chess positions from various openings, such as the English, Dutch, and Sicilian openings, which are used to analyze concepts related to opening strategies.

5. **AlphaZero (AZ) Self-Play Games Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the self-play games of AlphaZero, capturing positions where different versions of AlphaZero (trained at different Elo ratings) select different moves.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may include the original papers or resources from which the datasets were derived.

For example, the citation for the **Stockfish Dataset** might reference the Stockfish engine's official website or documentation, while the **STS Dataset** might reference the original work by Corbit et al. (2014).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper attribution.
