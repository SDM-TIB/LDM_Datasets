To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying RLAIF for Code Generation with API-usage in Lightweight LLMs" by Sujan Dutta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Gorilla dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this is a key dataset to focus on. The introduction also references the Gorilla dataset and discusses its significance in the context of code generation tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which in this case is found in **section 2**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the Gorilla dataset, specifying that it consists of three parts: HuggingFace, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. They clarify that their work focuses on the HuggingFace part, which is the most extensive, featuring over 925 unique APIs across 37 different domains. Each instance includes an instruction, domain, API call, explanation, and complete code.

I will summarize the key details of the Gorilla dataset as follows:

1. **Gorilla Dataset**: This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper. It contains a variety of API calls and is structured to facilitate code generation tasks that require API usage. The authors emphasize that the dataset is distinct from traditional code generation datasets, as it focuses on AI-related tasks that require significant computational resources.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Gorilla dataset. The authors attribute the dataset to Patil et al. (2023), so I will locate that reference:

- For the **Gorilla dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shishir G. Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Xin Wang, and Joseph E. Gonzalez. *Gorilla: Large language model connected with massive APIs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.15334, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Gorilla dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the Gorilla dataset as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for dataset extraction from the paper.
