To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Handful of Trials using Probabilistic Dynamics Models" by Kurtland Chua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors mention using **MuJoCo** for their experiments, which is a physics engine for model-based control. They also refer to several specific tasks evaluated in their experiments, such as **Cartpole**, **7-DOF Pusher**, **7-DOF Reacher**, and **Half-cheetah**. However, I need to confirm if these tasks are associated with specific datasets or if they are part of the MuJoCo simulation environment.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or tasks mentioned. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmark tasks, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the findings:

1. **MuJoCo**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is the simulation environment used for the experiments. The citation for MuJoCo is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026â€“5033.

2. **Cartpole**: This is a classic control task often used in reinforcement learning. It does not have a separate citation as it is a standard benchmark.

3. **7-DOF Pusher**: Similar to Cartpole, this is a task defined within the MuJoCo environment and does not have a separate dataset citation.

4. **7-DOF Reacher**: Again, this is a task within the MuJoCo framework and does not have a separate citation.

5. **Half-cheetah**: This task is also part of the MuJoCo environment and does not have a separate dataset citation.

Since the tasks are part of the MuJoCo simulation, I will only provide the citation for MuJoCo itself. 

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MuJoCo environment as it is the primary source of the datasets used in the experiments.
