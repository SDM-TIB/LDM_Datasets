To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Backtracking Counterfactuals for Causally Compliant Explanations" by Klaus-Rudolf Kladny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on a modified version of MNIST and CelebA datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention:

1. **Morpho-MNIST**: This is described as a modified version of the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors reference a previous work by Castro et al. (2019) that introduced this modified dataset.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset is mentioned as containing images with binary attributes such as Age, Gender, Beard, and Bald. The authors cite Liu et al. (2015) as the source of this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Morpho-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Daniel C. Castro, Jeremy Tan, Bernhard Kainz, Ender Konukoglu, and Ben Glocker. *Morpho-MNIST: Quantitative Assessment and Diagnostics for Representation Learning*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 20:1–29, 2019.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have the names and full citations for the datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Morpho-MNIST**: A modified version of the MNIST dataset used for experiments.
   - Citation: Castro et al. (2019).

2. **CelebA**: A dataset containing images with various binary attributes.
   - Citation: Liu et al. (2015).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
