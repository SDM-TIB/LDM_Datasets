To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prospect Theory-inspired Automated P2P Energy Trading with Q-learning-based Dynamic Pricing" by Ashutosh Timilsina and Simone Silvestri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that results are based on "real traces of energy consumption and production," which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experimental setup sections**. In the experimental setup, the authors state that they used a "realistic dataset for buyers’ energy consumption obtained from [31]" and that sellers are equipped with "4kW rooftop solar located in Lexington, Kentucky, USA," with energy generation estimated using "NREL’s PVWatts Calculator [32]." This gives me two datasets to focus on.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **buyers' energy consumption dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pecan Street Inc. *[Online]. Available: www.pecanstreet.org*.

2. For the **NREL’s PVWatts Calculator**, the citation is:
   > Solar Resource Data. *[Online]. Available: pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php*.

Both datasets are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
