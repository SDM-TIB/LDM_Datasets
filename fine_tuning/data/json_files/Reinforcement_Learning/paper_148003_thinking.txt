To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Pruning for CNNs Using Genetic Algorithm" by Chuanguang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions applying the proposed method to prune a pre-trained LeNet across the **MNIST dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for any additional mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **experimental results** sections. The introduction discusses the need for different requirements in terms of error, computational cost, and storage for CNNs, but it does not introduce any new datasets. The experimental results section, however, confirms that the authors conducted their experiments on the **MNIST dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> MNIST dataset, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Last accessed 23 Mar 2019.

This citation is essential for proper documentation of the dataset used in the research.

At this point, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation clearly.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets.
2. Confirming the dataset mentioned in the experimental results.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
