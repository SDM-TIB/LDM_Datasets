To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representations of epistemic uncertainty and its perception in data-driven initiatives" by Mario Angelelli and Massimiliano Gervasi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for new models to describe uncertainties in data-driven initiatives, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the growing interest in data-driven strategies and mentions various frameworks and models but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors describe any experiments or analyses that involve datasets. If they mention case studies or empirical data, I will note those down.

In the **discussion or conclusion sections**, I will check for any references to datasets used in their analysis or any datasets that are foundational to their research. If the authors cite specific datasets or studies that utilized datasets, I will make a note of those.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to extract the following information for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all citations are accurate and complete.
