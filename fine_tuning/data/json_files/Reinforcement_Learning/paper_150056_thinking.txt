To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Q-Learning and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies for Self Driving Agents" by Arhum Ishtiaq et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and implementation sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, the authors discuss the implementation of Q-learning and NEAT in a 2D car racing simulator. They mention creating different map variations for training the agents, which suggests that the datasets are related to these simulated environments. I will look for specific references to these maps or any datasets used to train the models.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or simulation environment, I will ensure to note down the full citation as follows:

- If they mention a dataset related to Q-learning or NEAT, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced that dataset and provide its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and can be referenced appropriately in future research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing.
