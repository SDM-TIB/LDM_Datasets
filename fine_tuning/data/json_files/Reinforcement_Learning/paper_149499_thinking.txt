To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency Fitness Assignment: Optimization without Bias for Good Solutions can be Efficient" by Thomas Weise et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. If the datasets are well-known benchmarks, I will ensure to include their original citations as well.

As I identify each dataset, I will note down the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the "OneMax" problem as a dataset, I would look for its description and citation, which might be something like:
- **OneMax**: A unimodal optimization problem where the goal is to discover a bit string of all ones. 
  > H. Mühlenbein, “How genetic algorithms really work: Mutation and hillclimbing,” in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature 2 (PPSN-II). Elsevier, 1992, pp. 15–26.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.
