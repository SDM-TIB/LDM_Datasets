To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing a Personalized Learning Path Using Genetic Algorithms Approach" by Lumbardh Elshani and Krenare Pireva Nuçi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of personalized learning paths and mention that their approach is based on a genetic algorithm model. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the part labeled **"Data Collection and Preparation."** Here, the authors state that the dataset used in their model is adapted from another source, specifically referencing a dataset that consists of learning objects within a Java course. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the original source to provide a complete citation.

The authors mention that they extracted detailed information from this dataset, including attributes like title, description, relation degree, duration, difficulty value, and ratings. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset in this section.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will look at the **references section** of the paper. The authors reference a source as [6], which corresponds to:
> Krenare Pireva and Petros Kefalas. *A recommender system based on hierarchical clustering for cloud e-learning*. In International Symposium on Intelligent and Distributed Computing, pages 235–245. Springer, 2017.

This citation indicates that the dataset is related to a previous work by the authors, which is essential for proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Learning Objects Dataset for Java Course
   - **Description**: A dataset containing learning objects with attributes such as title, description, relation degree, duration, difficulty value, and ratings.
   - **Source Citation**: Krenare Pireva and Petros Kefalas. *A recommender system based on hierarchical clustering for cloud e-learning*. In International Symposium on Intelligent and Distributed Computing, pages 235–245. Springer, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for further processing or review.
