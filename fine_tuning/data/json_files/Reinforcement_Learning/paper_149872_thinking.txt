To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepTPI: Test Point Insertion with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Zhengyuan Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors typically discuss the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, the authors mention that they extracted **400 sub-circuits from ISCAS89 and ITC99** and converted them to AIG format for reinforcement learning training. This indicates that these two datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will also check **Table I** and **Table II** in the experiments section, which summarize the statistics of the training and testing circuits. This will provide additional context about the datasets, such as the number of gates, primary inputs, and outputs.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ISCAS89**: The ISCAS89 benchmark suite is a well-known collection of combinational and sequential circuits used for testing and evaluation in electronic design automation. The original reference for this dataset is:
   > F. Brglez, D. Bryan, and K. Kozminski. "Notes on the ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits." North Carolina State University, 1989.

2. **ITC99**: The ITC99 benchmark suite is another widely used set of benchmark circuits for testing purposes. The reference for this dataset is:
   > S. Davidson. "Characteristics of the ITC'99 benchmark circuits." In IEEE International Test Synthesis Workshop (ITSW), 1999.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation.
