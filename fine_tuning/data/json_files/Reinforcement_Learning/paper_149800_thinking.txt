To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Sufﬁciency of Off-Policyness and Soft Clipping: PPO is still Insufﬁcient according to an Off-Policy Measure" by Xing Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** and **Arcade Learning Environment** for their experiments. These are platforms rather than datasets, so I will need to look for specific datasets within the context of these environments.

In the **empirical evaluation section**, the authors discuss various tasks such as **Ant-v2**, **HalfCheetah-v2**, and **Walker2d-v2** for continuous tasks, and **Enduro-v4**, **Breakout-v4**, and **BeamRider-v4** for discrete tasks. These tasks are associated with specific environments in OpenAI Gym, which serve as datasets for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments and tasks. The citations for the environments are as follows:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253–279.

Next, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information from the paper.
