To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm" by Md. Mahfuzur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors discuss the performance of their proposed algorithm (QCDC-DR-GA) and compare it with other methods. Here, they mention that they designed six scenarios based on different configurations of container ships, which indicates the presence of datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **Table 2**, which outlines the configurations of the six datasets, including the number of stacks and maximum stack height. This table is crucial as it summarizes the dataset characteristics.

I will also check the **data availability section**, where the authors mention that the datasets consist of loading and unloading plans generated under six distinct scenarios. They provide a link to access the detailed generated data, which is essential for citation.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **Dataset 1**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 30 stacks with a maximum stack height of 10.
   - **Citation**: Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Md Abrar Jahin, Md. Saiful Islam, M. F. Mridha. *Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm*. Preprint submitted to Elsevier, June 14, 2024. Available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/cj08-qn62.

2. **Dataset 2**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 25 stacks with a maximum stack height of 10.
   - **Citation**: Same as above.

3. **Dataset 3**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 20 stacks with a maximum stack height of 10.
   - **Citation**: Same as above.

4. **Dataset 4**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 15 stacks with a maximum stack height of 8.
   - **Citation**: Same as above.

5. **Dataset 5**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 10 stacks with a maximum stack height of 5.
   - **Citation**: Same as above.

6. **Dataset 6**: 
   - **Description**: Configuration for 5 stacks with a maximum stack height of 4.
   - **Citation**: Same as above.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly defined and properly cited, as the citations are crucial for academic integrity and referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
