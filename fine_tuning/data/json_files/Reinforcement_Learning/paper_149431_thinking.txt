To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data" by Weirui Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved significant performance on the **Atari 100k benchmark** and the **DMControl 100k benchmark**. This indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe the **Atari 100k benchmark** in section 5.1, where they explain that it consists of 26 Atari games and allows the agent to interact with 100,000 environment steps. This is a clear indication that the Atari 100k benchmark is a dataset used for their experiments.

Additionally, in section 5.1, the authors mention the **DeepMind Control 100k benchmark**, which is also used for evaluating their method. This benchmark includes various simulated robotics tasks and consists of 100,000 environment steps.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Atari 100k benchmark**, the citation is:
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Atari 100k benchmark**: A dataset consisting of 26 Atari games, allowing agents to interact with 100,000 environment steps, which corresponds to approximately 2 hours of real-time gameplay.

- **DeepMind Control 100k benchmark**: A dataset that includes various challenging visual robotics tasks, also consisting of 100,000 environment steps.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
