To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trust Region-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization" by Yuhui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that indicate their size or structure.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets"** section or subsections within the experiments. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** for experiments, I would look for the citation:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

If the paper references any specific benchmark datasets, such as those from previous works, I will also extract those citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be used for further analysis or research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
