To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Royal Game of Ur Using Reinforcement Learning" by Girik Malik and Sidharth Malhotra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the Royal Game of Ur, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (section 3) closely. Here, the authors describe their implementation of a simulator for the Royal Game of Ur, which serves as a testbed for their algorithms. They mention that the simulator is open source and available on GitHub, which indicates that the simulator itself could be considered a dataset for testing purposes.

In section 3.1, the authors provide a link to their simulator:
- **Game of Ur Simulator**: This is an open-source implementation of the Royal Game of Ur, which can be found at https://github.com/sidharth0094/game-of-ur-reinforcement-learning.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or benchmarks used for training or testing, I will focus on this simulator as the primary dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the simulator. However, since the simulator is a self-contained implementation by the authors, I will treat it as a dataset and provide the citation as follows:

- For **Game of Ur Simulator**, the citation is:
  > Malik, G., & Malhotra, S. (2022). *Solving Royal Game of Ur Using Reinforcement Learning*. Available at https://github.com/sidharth0094/game-of-ur-reinforcement-learning.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The focus will be on ensuring that the citation is complete and accurately reflects the source of the dataset.
