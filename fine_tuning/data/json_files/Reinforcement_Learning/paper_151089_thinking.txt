To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secure Information Embedding in Images with Hybrid Firefly Algorithm" by Sahil Nokhwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a novel steganographic approach but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for testing or validation of the proposed methods. The authors mention that the dataset employed in this work has been acquired from publicly accessible sources and is available upon request from the primary author. However, they do not specify the name of the dataset in the text.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names or details of any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. I will look for any studies that might have used datasets relevant to the research topic of steganography or image processing.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite various works related to steganography and optimization algorithms, but none of these references provide a specific dataset name. The references include works on algorithms and techniques but do not point to a dataset that was used in this study.

Given that the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors have indicated the dataset is available upon request, which could be a potential avenue for obtaining more information if needed.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, and I will include a note about the availability of the dataset upon request from the authors. This will ensure that any future inquiries can reference this point.

Now, I will prepare to compile my findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
