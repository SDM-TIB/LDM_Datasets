To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Sensor Data for Remote Assistance of Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Generative Models" by Daniel Bogdoll et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms using different datasets from the autonomous driving domain, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using diverse lidar data sources, specifically naming the **KITTI dataset**, **Waymo Open Perception Dataset**, and **CARLA**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets utilized for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Evaluation)**, the authors elaborate on the training and testing of their models. They specifically state that the **KITTI dataset** consists of 7,481 RGB training images and 7,518 RGB test images, which confirms its use in their experiments. They also mention that the **CARLA simulator** is used as a sensor data source, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
