To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FACMAC: Factored Multi-Agent Centralised Policy Gradients" by Bei Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically details the datasets employed in the study. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **Multi-Agent Particle Environments** and introduce a new benchmark called **Multi-Agent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo)**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

In the **MAMuJoCo section**, the authors describe various tasks and environments created for their experiments. They provide specific details about the tasks, such as **2-Agent Swimmer**, **2-Agent Reacher**, and **ManyAgent Ant**, which are part of the MAMuJoCo benchmark. Each task has its own characteristics and goals, which are essential for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the MAMuJoCo benchmark, the authors reference the original MuJoCo physics engine and the OpenAI Gym, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's origins.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environments**:
   > Ryan Lowe, Yi Wu, Aviv Tamar, Jean Harb, Pieter Abbeel, and Igor Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 6379–6390, 2017.

2. **MuJoCo**:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026–5033, 2012.

3. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
