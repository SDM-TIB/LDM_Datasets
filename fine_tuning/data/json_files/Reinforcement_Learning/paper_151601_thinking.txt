To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Tuning of the Firefly Algorithm by Standard Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods" by Geethu Joy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the use of optimization algorithms and their parameter tuning, which may lead to the identification of benchmark functions used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Setup and Benchmarks)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. Here, they mention using two benchmark functions: the **Rosenbrock function** and the **Sphere function**, along with a **spring design problem**. These are not traditional datasets but rather mathematical functions used for optimization testing.

I will then look for any references to these benchmark functions in the **References section** to provide proper citations. The Rosenbrock function is a well-known mathematical function, and its citation is:

- For the **Rosenbrock function**:
  > Rosenbrock, H.H. (1960). An Automatic Method for Finding the Greatest or Least Value of a Function. *The Computer Journal*, 175–184.

The **Sphere function** is also a standard benchmark function in optimization literature, but it may not have a specific citation as it is widely recognized. However, I will note its common usage in optimization studies.

For the **spring design problem**, the authors reference a specific optimization problem but do not provide a formal citation. I will summarize the problem as described in the paper, noting that it is a design problem with constraints.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citations for the benchmark functions and a description of the spring design problem.

1. **Rosenbrock Function**: A nonlinear benchmark function used for optimization, known for its challenging landscape.
   - Citation: Rosenbrock, H.H. (1960). An Automatic Method for Finding the Greatest or Least Value of a Function. *The Computer Journal*, 175–184.

2. **Sphere Function**: A convex benchmark function commonly used in optimization studies, defined as the sum of the squares of its variables.

3. **Spring Design Problem**: An engineering design optimization problem with nonlinear constraints, used to evaluate the performance of the Firefly Algorithm.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that each entry is clear and properly cited.
