To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Efficient Exploration with Symbolic Priors on Action Sequence Equivalences" by Toby Johnstone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may explicitly name datasets or refer to them indirectly.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the experiments conducted, as they typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the datasets employed in the experiments.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any specific details provided about their structure or contents. If the authors refer to datasets by acronyms or shorthand, I will ensure to clarify their full names.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **MiniGrid** environment, I would look for the citation:
> Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

If the paper discusses other datasets, such as those used in reinforcement learning tasks, I will ensure to extract their full citations similarly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant dataset information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
