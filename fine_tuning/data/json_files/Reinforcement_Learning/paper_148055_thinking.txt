To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Guarantees for Perception-Based Control" by Sarah Dean et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically discusses the context and motivation for the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section usually details the methodologies used, including any datasets that were utilized for training or testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the datasets used.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **self-driving car simulation platform called CARLA**. I will note this as a dataset or platform used for their experiments. Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned, particularly in the context of training data for the perception map or any other components of their approach.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **CARLA dataset**, I will look for the following citation:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., LÃ³pez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract their full citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
