To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection and Continual Learning of Novel Face Presentation Attacks" by Mohammad Rostami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two benchmark datasets as well as a newly introduced dataset." This suggests that there are at least three datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the **Proposed Method** section, the authors introduce the **PADISI-Face Dataset**, which is described as a new dataset with diverse attack types. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in the experiments. In the **Experimental Validation** section, the authors mention using the **HQ-WMCA dataset** alongside the newly introduced PADISI-Face dataset. This confirms that there are two datasets being utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

1. **PADISI-Face Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset in detail, including its characteristics and the number of participants involved. However, they do not provide a formal citation in the references section. Since it is a newly introduced dataset, I will note that it is publicly available at https://github.com/ISICV/PADISI_USC_Dataset.

2. **HQ-WMCA Dataset**: The authors reference this dataset multiple times. The citation for this dataset is:
   > G. Heusch, A. George, D. Geissbühler, Z. Mostaani, and S. Marcel. *Deep models and shortwave infrared information to detect face presentation attacks*. IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science, 2(4):399–409, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PADISI-Face Dataset**: A new dataset introduced in this paper, containing various major face spoofing attack types. It includes data from 360 participants and is publicly available for research purposes.

- **HQ-WMCA Dataset**: A previously established dataset used for comparison in the experiments, which includes various attack types.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are correctly formatted for any future use.
