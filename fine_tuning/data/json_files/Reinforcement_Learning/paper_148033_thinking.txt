To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Model-based Planning with Policy Networks" by Tingwu Wang and Jimmy Ba, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method in various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. In this paper, the authors refer to several environments from the OpenAI Gym, which are likely datasets used for their experiments.

In section 5.1, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on **12 environments**, including:
1. **Cheetah**
2. **Ant**
3. **Hopper**
4. **Swimmer**
5. **Pendulum**
6. **InvertedPendulum**
7. **Acrobot**
8. **Cartpole**
9. **Walker2d**
10. **Pusher**
11. **Reacher3D**
12. **Cheetah-v0**

These environments are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning and are associated with specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The environments mentioned are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized framework for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Additionally, I will note that the environments like Cheetah and Ant are derived from the MuJoCo physics engine, which is also referenced in the paper. The citation for MuJoCo is:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environments** (Cheetah, Ant, etc.)
   - Citation: Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **MuJoCo Physics Engine**
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are formatted correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
