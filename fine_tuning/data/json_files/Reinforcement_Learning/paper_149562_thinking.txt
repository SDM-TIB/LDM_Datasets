To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on Mitigating Hard Boundaries of Decision-Tree-based Uncertainty Estimates for AI Models" by Pascal Gerber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that datasets for a pedestrian detection use case were generated using the CARLA simulator and YOLOv3, indicating that these are key datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Study Planning and Execution)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention three datasets:

1. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,204,119 data points generated to create quality impact models based on various softening approaches.
2. **Calibration Dataset**: This dataset contains 402,040 data points and is used to calibrate the uncertainty estimates of the quality impact models.
3. **Evaluation Dataset**: This dataset includes 400,884 data points and is representative of the target application scope for evaluating the uncertainty estimates.

The paper also states that these datasets were generated using the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for understanding the context of the data.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets and any relevant tools mentioned. The CARLA simulator is cited as follows:

- For **CARLA Simulator**:
  > Codevilla, F., Dosovitskiy, A., Koltun, V., Lopez, A., & Ros, G. (2017). CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator. arXiv:1711.03938.

Additionally, the YOLOv3 implementation is referenced:
- For **YOLOv3**:
  > YOLO. (2020). PyTorch-YOLOv3. Retrieved from https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset and tool used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
