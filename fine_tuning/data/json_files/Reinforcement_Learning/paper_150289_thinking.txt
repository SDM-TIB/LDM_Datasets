To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Real-Time Multi-Robot Cooperative Exploration" by Chao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a framework called ACE and highlights its application in both simulation and real-world environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of multi-agent cooperative exploration. They mention the use of simulation environments and real-world testing, which may imply the existence of specific datasets or environments used for these experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments. The authors describe their experiments in a grid-based scenario and a high-fidelity visual-based environment called Habitat. This indicates that there are at least two datasets or environments involved in their research.

I will then check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of the environments used. The authors specify that they conducted experiments in a grid-based multi-room scenario and in the Habitat environment, which is based on the Gibson dataset. This is a crucial point as it directly identifies a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **GridWorld Simulator**: The authors mention using a grid-based simulator for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this simulator in the paper, so I will note it as a general environment used for testing.

2. **Gibson Dataset**: The authors explicitly state that they used the Gibson dataset for their experiments in the Habitat environment. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Fei Xia, Amir R Zamir, Zhiyang He, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9068–9079, 2018.

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citation for the Gibson dataset and to see if there are any other datasets mentioned that I may have missed.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **GridWorld Simulator**: A general environment used for multi-agent exploration experiments (no specific citation provided).
- **Gibson Dataset**: 
   > Fei Xia, Amir R Zamir, Zhiyang He, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9068–9079, 2018.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
