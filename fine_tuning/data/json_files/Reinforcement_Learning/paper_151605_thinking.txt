To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-Efficient Imitative Multi-Token Decision Transformer for Real-World Driving" by Hang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the performance is evaluated on the **Waymax benchmark**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The authors discuss the importance of leveraging large offline datasets for training neural networks in autonomous driving, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**: This dataset contains 531,101 real-world driving scenarios for training and 44,096 scenarios for validation. Each scenario consists of 90 frames of data.

2. **Waymax Simulator**: While not a traditional dataset, it is mentioned as a simulator that provides embedded support for reinforcement learning and diverse scenarios drawn from real driving data.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, X., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., Vasudevan, V., Han, W., Ngiam, J., Zhao, H., Timofeev, A., Ettinger, S., Krivokon, M., Gao, A., Joshi, A., Zhang, Y., Guo, J., Shlens, J., Chen, Z., & Anguelov, D. (2020). Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- The **Waymax Simulator** does not have a specific citation in the references, but it is mentioned in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and note the Waymax Simulator as part of the experimental setup.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing.
