To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Reward Poisoning Attacks on Online Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Yinglun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of attacks on various environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using several Gym environments, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. Specifically, they list:

1. **CartPole**
2. **LunarLander**
3. **MountainCar**
4. **Acrobot**
5. **HalfCheetah**
6. **Hopper**
7. **Walker2d**
8. **Swimmer**

These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, so I will look for the citation related to the Gym toolkit.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **CartPole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **LunarLander**: A simulation of a lunar lander that must be landed safely on the moon's surface.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

3. **MountainCar**: A problem where a car must build enough momentum to reach the top of a hill.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

4. **Acrobot**: A two-link robot arm that must swing up to a certain height.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

5. **HalfCheetah**: A simulation of a half-cheetah running in a 2D environment.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

6. **Hopper**: A simulation of a one-legged robot that must learn to hop forward.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

7. **Walker2d**: A simulation of a 2D bipedal walker that must learn to walk.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

8. **Swimmer**: A simulation of a swimming robot that must learn to swim efficiently.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
