To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Sample Analysis for SARSA with Linear Function Approximation" by Shaofeng Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, I will specifically check for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations of the SARSA algorithm.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they focus on theoretical analysis and algorithm development without relying on specific datasets for empirical validation. However, they reference previous works that may have used datasets relevant to their analysis.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that might include datasets. I will look for papers that are known to provide datasets related to reinforcement learning or SARSA algorithms.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that may correspond to datasets or benchmarks in the context of reinforcement learning:

1. **Antos et al. (2008)**: This paper discusses fitted policy iteration and may reference datasets used in their experiments.
   > Antos, A., Szepesvari, C., & Munos, R. (2008). Learning near-optimal policies with Bellman-residual minimization based fitted policy iteration and a single sample path. *Machine Learning*, 71(1), 89–129.

2. **Gupta et al. (2019)**: This paper provides finite-time performance bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms and may reference datasets.
   > Gupta, H., Srikant, R., & Ying, L. (2019). Finite-time performance bounds and adaptive learning rate selection for two time-scale reinforcement learning. In *Proc. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*.

3. **Melo et al. (2008)**: This paper analyzes reinforcement learning with function approximation and may include datasets.
   > Melo, F. S., Meyn, S. P., & Ribeiro, M. I. (2008). An analysis of reinforcement learning with function approximation. In *Proc. International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*, pages 664–671.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the authors may have relied on existing literature for datasets relevant to their analysis. 

In conclusion, while I could not extract specific datasets from the paper, I have identified relevant citations that may lead to datasets used in related research. I will document these citations for reference in any future work or analysis.
