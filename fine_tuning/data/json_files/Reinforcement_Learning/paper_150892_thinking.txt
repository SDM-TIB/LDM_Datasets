To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Sequential Decision-Making in Geosteering: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Ressi Bonti Muhammad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous works, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology, experiments, or results**. In this paper, the authors discuss their application of reinforcement learning to geosteering scenarios, and they may have used specific datasets for training or evaluation.

I will pay particular attention to any **numerical examples** or **case studies** presented in the paper, as these often include details about the datasets used. For instance, the authors mention two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, which could imply the existence of datasets associated with those scenarios.

Once I identify any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper references datasets from previous studies, I will ensure to extract the full citation for those studies. If the authors have created their own datasets, I will look for any documentation or references they provide regarding those datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
