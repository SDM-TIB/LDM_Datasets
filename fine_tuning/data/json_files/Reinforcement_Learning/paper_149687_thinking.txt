To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MicroRacer: a didactic environment for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Andrea Asperti and Marco Del Brutto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the environment and related software** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the MicroRacer environment, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (MicroRacer)**, where the authors describe the environment in detail. Here, they mention that MicroRacer generates random tracks for the racing environment, but they do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they discuss the internal mechanics of the environment and the configurations available for users.

I will also check **section 5 (Baselines benchmarks)**, which discusses the performance of various learning models implemented in the MicroRacer environment. However, this section primarily focuses on the algorithms and their training times rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any external datasets used for training or evaluation, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. However, the references primarily cite other works related to reinforcement learning and do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created a custom environment (MicroRacer) that generates its own data through simulated racing scenarios.

Since there are no datasets to extract from this paper, I will conclude that there are no relevant datasets to cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed the steps of identifying their names, descriptions, and then locating their full citations in the references.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this research paper, and therefore, no citations are necessary.
