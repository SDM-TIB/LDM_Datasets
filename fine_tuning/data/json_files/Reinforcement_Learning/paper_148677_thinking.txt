To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Mask Generator: Learning to Generate Adaptive Word Maskings for Language Model Adaptation" by Minki Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions validating the Neural Mask Generator (NMG) on several question answering and text classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention three datasets for question answering:

1. **SQuAD v1.1**: This dataset is referenced as a well-known benchmark for machine comprehension tasks.
2. **NewsQA**: Another dataset used for evaluating question answering systems.
3. **emrQA**: A dataset specifically designed for question answering on electronic medical records.

Additionally, for text classification, the authors mention:

1. **IMDb**: A dataset commonly used for sentiment analysis.
2. **ChemProt**: A dataset used for chemical biology tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **SQuAD v1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2016, Austin, Texas, USA, November 1-4, 2016, pages 2383–2392.

- For **NewsQA**, the citation is:
  > Adam Trischler, Tong Wang, Xingdi Yuan, Justin Harris, Alessandro Sordoni, Philip Bachman, and Kaheer Suleman. *NewsQA: A Machine Comprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, Rep4NLP@ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, August 3, 2017, pages 191–200.

- For **emrQA**, the citation is:
  > Anusri Pampari, Preethi Raghavan, Jennifer J. Liang, and Jian Peng. *emrQA: A Large Corpus for Question Answering on Electronic Medical Records*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Brussels, Belgium, October 31 - November 4, 2018, pages 2357–2368.

- For **IMDb**, the citation is:

In The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Proceedings of the Conference, 19-24 June, 2011, Portland, Oregon, USA, pages 142–150.

- For **ChemProt**, the citation is:
  > Jens Kringelum, Sonny Kim Kjærulff, Søren Brunak, Ole Lund, Tudor I. Oprea, and Olivier Taboureau. *Chemprot-3.0: A Global Chemical Biology Diseases Mapping*. Database, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
