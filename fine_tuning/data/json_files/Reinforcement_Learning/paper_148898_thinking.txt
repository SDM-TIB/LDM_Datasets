To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning and Learning Using Adaptive Entropy Tree Search" by Piotr Kozakowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **Atari benchmark**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Atari games involved in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments** section, the authors refer to a set of **21 Atari games** from the Arcade Learning Environment. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments are likely the game environments themselves. I will note down the names of these games as they represent the datasets.

Now, I will compile the list of datasets identified:

1. **Atari Games Dataset**: This dataset consists of 21 different Atari games used for evaluating the proposed method. The specific games mentioned include:
   - Alien
   - Amidar
   - Asterix
   - Asteroids
   - Atlantis
   - BankHeist
   - BeamRider
   - Breakout
   - Centipede
   - DemonAttack
   - Enduro
   - Frostbite
   - Gopher
   - Hero
   - MsPacman
   - Phoenix
   - Qbert
   - Robotank
   - Seaquest
   - SpaceInvaders
   - WizardOfWor

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari dataset. The Atari games are part of the **Arcade Learning Environment**, which is cited in the paper. The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I format this information clearly for any downstream processing or review.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Atari Games Dataset**: A collection of 21 Atari games used for evaluation.
- **Citation for the Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
