To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation Error Correction in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Deterministic Actor-Critic Methods" by Baturay Saglam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks, which indicates that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their evaluation methodology and the specific environments used for testing their algorithm. They mention using a suite of **12 continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym**. This is a strong indication that these tasks are the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the experiments section. The authors specifically refer to the **OpenAI Gym** environments, which are widely recognized datasets in the reinforcement learning community. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. CoRR, vol. abs/1606.01540. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets beyond the OpenAI Gym tasks, I will conclude that this is the primary dataset referenced in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This will allow for easy reference in future work or discussions regarding the datasets used in this research.
