To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active inference: demystified and compared" by Noor Sajid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any datasets that may be referenced in the context of previous work or foundational studies. This section often contains background information that can lead to the identification of datasets used in the research.

I will then examine the **methods section**, which typically details the experimental design and any datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets from established sources, such as OpenAI Gym environments or other publicly available datasets related to reinforcement learning and active inference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any required formatting or further processing.
