To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Hard Alignments with Variational Inference" by Dieterich Lawson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on a phoneme recognition task using the **TIMIT dataset** and a modified version called **Multi-TIMIT**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, as it typically contains specific information about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **TIMIT dataset**, noting that it consists of 3,696 training utterances, 400 validation utterances, and 182 test utterances. They also mention the processing of audio waveforms into frames of log mel filterbank spectrograms, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

The authors then introduce the **Multi-TIMIT dataset**, which is created by mixing male and female voices from the original TIMIT dataset. They provide details about how the mixing is done and the characteristics of the new dataset, including that it retains the same number of utterances and target phonemes as TIMIT.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **TIMIT dataset** is as follows:
- **TIMIT Dataset**: 
  > K-F Lee and H-W Hon, “Speaker-independent phone recognition using hidden markov models,” IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 1641–1648, 1989.

The **Multi-TIMIT dataset** is a modified version of TIMIT, so I will cite the original TIMIT dataset as its reference.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
