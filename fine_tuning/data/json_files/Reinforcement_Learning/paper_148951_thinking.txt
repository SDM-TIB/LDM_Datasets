To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactuals and Causability in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications" by Yu-Liang Chou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive details about each dataset. This section may provide insights into the purpose of each dataset, how it was collected, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

I will compile the information for each dataset, ensuring to include:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented and attributed correctly, ready for further processing or review.
