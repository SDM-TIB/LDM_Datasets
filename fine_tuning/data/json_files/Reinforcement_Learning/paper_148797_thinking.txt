To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Cost Management in Smart Meters with Mutual Information-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Mohammadhadi Shateri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of an actual smart meters dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) dataset** in the **numerical results** section. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it was used.

In the **numerical results and discussion** section, the authors describe the ECO dataset as containing 1 Hz electricity usage measurements along with occupancy labels from five houses in Switzerland. They also mention the sampling rate and the total number of samples used for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ECO dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **ECO Dataset**:
  > C. Beckel, W. Kleiminger, R. Cicchetti, T. Staake, and S. Santini. *The eco data set and the performance of non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Embedded Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, pp. 80â€“89, ACM, 2014.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **ECO Dataset**: This dataset includes 1 Hz electricity usage measurements and occupancy labels from five houses in Switzerland. The measurements were sampled at a rate of 15 minutes, and a total of 2700 samples were used, split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 70:10:20.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
