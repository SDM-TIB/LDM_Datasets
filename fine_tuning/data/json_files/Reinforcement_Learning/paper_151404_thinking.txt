To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REBEL: Reinforcement Learning via Regressing Relative Rewards" by Zhaolin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that REBEL is evaluated on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **TL;DR Dataset**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks. It consists of human reference summaries and preference data. The authors mention that it includes 117K training examples, 6.45K validation examples, and 6.55K test examples.

2. **Nectar Dataset**: This dataset is used in the general chat experiments. It contains 183K prompts and is designed to evaluate conversational models.

3. **UltraFeedback Dataset**: This dataset is also used in the general chat experiments, containing 64K prompts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution.

- For the **TL;DR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stiennon, N., Ouyang, L., Wu, J., Ziegler, D. M., Lowe, R., Voss, C., Radford, A., & Amodei, D. (2022). Learning to summarize from human feedback. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (Vol. 33, pp. 3008–3021).

- For the **Nectar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, B., Frick, E., Wu, T., Zhu, H., & Jiao, J. (2023). Starling-7B: Improving LLM Helpfulness & Harmlessness with RLAIF. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning*.

- For the **UltraFeedback Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cui, Q., Du, S. S., & others. (2023). UltraFeedback: Boosting Language Models with High-quality Feedback. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning*.

With the datasets and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **TL;DR Dataset**
   - Citation: Stiennon et al. (2022). Learning to summarize from human feedback. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (Vol. 33, pp. 3008–3021).

2. **Nectar Dataset**
   - Citation: Zhu et al. (2023). Starling-7B: Improving LLM Helpfulness & Harmlessness with RLAIF. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning*.

3. **UltraFeedback Dataset**
   - Citation: Cui et al. (2023). UltraFeedback: Boosting Language Models with High-quality Feedback. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning*.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
