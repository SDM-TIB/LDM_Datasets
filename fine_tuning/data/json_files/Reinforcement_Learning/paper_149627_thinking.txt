To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Warehouse Robot using Deep Q-Learning" by Ismot Sadik Peyas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the methodology and results sections for specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of warehouse robotics and the need for efficient navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where they describe the training and testing of their models. I will look for any references to datasets used for training the reinforcement learning models. If they mention any simulation environments or datasets, I will note them down.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I will check if the authors provide any details about the datasets used for evaluation or comparison. They may describe the environments in which their models were tested, which could indicate the datasets or simulation setups they utilized.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any references to external datasets or simulation environments in the **references section**. This could include citations for commonly used datasets in reinforcement learning or robotics research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Note any datasets or simulation environments described.
3. Check the references for full citations of any mentioned datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information with full citations for each identified dataset.
