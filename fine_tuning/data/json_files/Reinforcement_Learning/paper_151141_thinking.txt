To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selecting Subsets of Source Data for Transfer Learning with Applications in Metal Additive Manufacturing" by Yifan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that two datasets related to melt pool width are used, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **DED-LB/p Dataset**: This dataset is related to laser-based directed energy deposition using blown powder. It is published by the Stevens Institute of Technology and contains 61 pieces of data regarding melt pool width.

2. **DED-LB/w Dataset**: This dataset pertains to laser-based directed energy deposition using hot wire, collected from University West, Sweden. It contains 9 pieces of data regarding melt pool width.

3. **Relative Density Dataset**: This dataset is an open-source collection proposed by Liu et al. (2021) that includes data from various printing machines using the same material (Ti-6Al-4V). The dataset encompasses multiple process parameters and has varying data sizes from different machines.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **DED-LB/p Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Akhavan, J., Lyu, J., Mahmoud, Y., Xu, K., & Manoochehri, S. (2023). Dataset of in-situ coaxial observations and print’s cross-section images using direct energy deposition fabrication. Science Data Bank. https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.07121

- For the **DED-LB/w Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dehaghani, M. R., Sahraeidolatkhaneh, A., Nilsen, M., Sikström, F., Sajadi, P., Tang, Y., & Wang, G. G. (2023). System identification and closed-loop control of laser hot-wire directed energy deposition using the parameter-signature-property modeling scheme. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.12286.

- For the **Relative Density Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details about the datasets are captured accurately and comprehensively.
