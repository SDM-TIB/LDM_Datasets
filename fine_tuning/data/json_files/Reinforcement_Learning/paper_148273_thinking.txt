To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian optimization for backpropagation in Monte-Carlo tree search" by Yueqin Li and Nengli Lim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methods sections, as they often contain details about the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their methods in the context of computer Go, but they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will then move to the **methods section**, where they describe their experimental setup. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "9x9 Go" or "19x19 Go," I will ensure to find their respective citations. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset used in their experiments, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and complete for any further processing or review.
