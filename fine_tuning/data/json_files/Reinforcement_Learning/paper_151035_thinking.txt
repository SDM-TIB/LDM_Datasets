To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contact Energy Based Hindsight Experience Prioritization" by Erdi Sayar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various robotic manipulation tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks. The introduction discusses challenges in reinforcement learning for robotic tasks but does not explicitly name datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any mention of specific environments or benchmarks used for evaluation. The authors mention using a "7-DOF Fetch Robotic-arm MuJoCo simulation environment," which indicates that the MuJoCo environment is a key component of their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe three standard manipulation tasks: **FetchPickAndPlace**, **FetchPush**, and **FetchSlide**. These tasks are likely based on existing datasets or benchmarks, so I will need to confirm their origins.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **MuJoCo simulation environment**:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026â€“5033).

2. **Fetch Robotics tasks**:
   > Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., & Zaremba, W. (2018). *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*.

Now that I have identified the relevant datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **MuJoCo simulation environment**: A physics engine used for robotic simulations.
- **Fetch Robotics tasks**: Standard manipulation tasks used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
