To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Myocardial Infarction Detection over Multi-view Echocardiography" by Aysen Degerli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new benchmark dataset has been created, which is a strong indication that I will find specific dataset details later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experimental Results)**, where the authors introduce the **HMC-QU dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its composition and the context in which it was collected. The authors mention that the dataset consists of 260 echocardiography recordings from 130 subjects, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In this section, I will note the following details about the HMC-QU dataset:
- It includes recordings from both A2C and A4C views.
- It categorizes subjects into MI patients and non-MI subjects based on the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA).
- The dataset is publicly shared with the research community, which is important for accessibility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HMC-QU dataset. The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will reference it as follows:

- **HMC-QU Dataset**: 
  > Aysen Degerli, Serkan Kiranyaz, Tahir Hamid, Rashid Mazhar, and Moncef Gabbouj. *HMC-QU Dataset for Early Myocardial Infarction Detection*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/aysendegerli/hmcqu-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and complete, ready for any downstream applications or analyses.
