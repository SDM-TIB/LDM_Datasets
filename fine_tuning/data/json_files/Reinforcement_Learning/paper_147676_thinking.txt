To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Traffic Signal Control" by Wade Genders and Saiedeh Razavi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the development of a traffic signal control system using deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will look for any references to datasets in the introduction, where the authors might describe their methodology or previous work.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections, as these are likely to contain details about the datasets used for training and testing the reinforcement learning agent. In the methodology section, the authors describe the use of the traffic microsimulator SUMO for their experiments, which suggests that they may have used specific traffic data or simulation scenarios.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any references to datasets. The authors may discuss the performance of their agent in relation to specific datasets or simulation scenarios, which could provide insights into the datasets used.

If the paper includes a **literature review** or **related work** section, I will review it as well, as it may reference datasets used in previous studies that are relevant to the current research.

Once I identify any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific traffic dataset or simulation parameters, I will ensure to note the full citation, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper.
