To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MARL-FWC: Optimal Coordination of Freeway Traffic Control Measures" by Ahmed Fares et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets or simulations that might indicate the use of specific datasets. The abstract discusses the optimization of traffic flow using a system tested in the VISSIM traffic simulator, which suggests that there may be datasets related to traffic simulations.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets or prior works that may have utilized specific datasets. The introduction mentions the need for intelligent traffic control systems and cites previous works, which could lead to identifying datasets used in those studies.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, particularly looking for a subsection that explicitly discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments conducted using the VISSIM traffic simulator, which implies that they may have used specific traffic flow datasets. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the data used in their simulations.

In the **performance evaluation** section, the authors provide detailed results of their experiments, including tables that outline the demand scenarios for both the freeway and ramp flows. This section is crucial as it likely contains the specific datasets used for the simulations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to capture those citations accurately.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset related to traffic flow from a previous study, I will look up that study to obtain the full citation. If the authors created their own dataset, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. It is essential to ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, the type of data it contains, and any relevant details about its collection or usage.

Finally, I will format the extracted information into a structured output that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
