To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Interactive Search with Sentence-level Feedback" by Joyce C. Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on three search datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setting and Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three primary datasets:

1. **MS-MARCO**: This dataset is described as containing 3.2 million documents and providing relevance scores for every pair of queries and documents. It is used for document retrieval tasks.
   
2. **ORCAS**: This dataset is a click-log based dataset that includes 20 million clicks, 1.4 million documents, and 10 million queries, used for evaluating ranking results.

3. **HITL1**: This dataset is derived from a human-in-the-loop project and includes eight topics with eight queries per topic, totaling 30,000 documents and 1,053 selected feedback sentences.

Additionally, the authors mention two other datasets used for fine-tuning the user simulation function, which are:

- **ASNQ**: A high-quality dataset for answer sentence selection, consisting of 59,914 questions.
- **ciQA**: A web-based dataset for training interactive question answering, containing 30 topics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS-MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@ NIPs, 2016.

- For **ORCAS**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Daniel Campos, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Bodo Billerbeck. *ORCAS: 20 million clicked query-document pairs for analyzing search*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, 2020.

- For **HITL1**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is part of a multi-university collaborative project in the USA and will be released soon. (No specific citation is provided in the paper).

- For **ASNQ**, the citation is:
  > Siddhant Garg, Thuy Vu, and Alessandro Moschitti. *TANDA: Transfer and Adapt Pre-Trained Transformer Models for Answer Sentence Selection*. arXiv:1911.04118, 2019.

- For **ciQA**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is referenced in the context of training interactive question answering but does not have a specific citation provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
