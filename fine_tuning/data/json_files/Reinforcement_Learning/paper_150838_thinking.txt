To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting Double Q-Learning for Continuous Reinforcement Learning" by Arsenii Kuznetsov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on a "small set of MuJoCo environments," which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the author mentions conducting experiments on two specific MuJoCo environments: **Humanoid** and **Walker2d**. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for the experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these environments in the paper. The author does not provide extensive descriptions of the datasets, but it is clear that the experiments were conducted using the MuJoCo physics engine, which is commonly used for continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. Since the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the MuJoCo environments, I will refer to the original MuJoCo documentation and relevant papers that describe these environments:

1. **MuJoCo Humanoid**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine, which includes the Humanoid environment, is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

2. **MuJoCo Walker2d**: The Walker2d environment is also part of the MuJoCo suite, and the same citation applies:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly for any further processing or review.
