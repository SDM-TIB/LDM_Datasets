To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Efficient Q-Learning with Low Switching Cost" by Yu Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I may need to search for it online to find the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
