To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations as Interventions in Latent Space" by Riccardo Crupi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach using "a set of different experiments using synthetic and real datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They explicitly mention:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: A toy dataset generated with specific structural equations, which includes 100,000 samples with two features and a binary outcome.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset contains financial information of 1,000 applicants classified into high and low risk of defaulting on loans. The authors reference the dataset as being from Bache and Lichman (2013).

3. **Sachs Dataset**: This dataset consists of information on protein expression levels in the human immune system, with 854 observations. The authors cite Sachs et al. (2005) for this dataset.

4. **Proprietary Dataset**: A proprietary dataset with 220,304 credit applications, which is referenced as Castelnovo et al. (2020).

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, there is no external citation needed.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bache, K. and Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

- For the **Sachs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sachs, K., Perez, O., Peâ€™er, D., Lauffenburger, D. A., & Nolan, G. P. (2005). Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data. *Science*, 308(5721), 523-529.

- For the **Proprietary Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Castelnovo, A., Crupi, R., Del Gamba, G., Greco, G., Naseer, A., Regoli, D., & San Miguel Gonzalez, B. (2020). BeFair: Addressing fairness in the banking sector. In *2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)*, pages 3652-3661. IEEE.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
