To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Navigating Uncertainty: The Role of Short-Term Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Vehicle Safety" by Sushil Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a synthetic dataset for short-term trajectory prediction tasks using the CARLA simulator. This suggests that there is a dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section to gather more context about the dataset. The introduction emphasizes the importance of accurate trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles and mentions the creation of a novel dataset to support research in this area.

I will then look into the **methodology** section, particularly the **dataset generation** subsection, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they created. They describe two datasets:

1. **Level 1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 perspective view images, annotated with speed and local coordinates (x, y, z). It aims to provide a basic understanding of the environment for trajectory prediction.

2. **Level 2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,000 images and includes more complex scenarios with additional vehicles and pedestrians. It is designed to challenge the model and ensure it can handle a variety of real-life situations.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluating their CNN-LSTM model, reinforcing their significance in the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are synthetic and created by the authors using the CARLA simulator, they do not have traditional citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, the authors provide a link to access their dataset on GitHub.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Synthetic Dataset for Short-Term Trajectory Prediction**: Available at [https://github.com/sharmasushil/Navigating-Uncertainty-Trajectory-Prediction](https://github.com/sharmasushil/Navigating-Uncertainty-Trajectory-Prediction).

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and the citation, into a structured format for further processing.
