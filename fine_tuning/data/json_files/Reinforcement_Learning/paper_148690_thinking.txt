To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hindsight Experience Replay with Kronecker Product Approximate Curvature" by Dhuruva Priyan G M et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted using OpenAIâ€™s Mujoco environments, which suggests that specific datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. They specifically mention four environments:

1. **Fetch Push**: This environment involves a robot moving a box to a target location on a table. The authors note that their algorithm shows better sample efficiency in this environment.

2. **Fetch PickAndPlace**: In this environment, the robot must grasp a box and move it to a target location. The authors highlight the performance improvements of their algorithm in this multi-goal setting.

3. **Fetch Reach**: This is a simpler task where the robot moves its gripper to a target position. The authors indicate that their algorithm performs well in this environment.

4. **Fetch Slide**: This environment involves a puck that the robot must hit to reach a target position. The authors discuss the challenges faced in this environment.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are part of OpenAI's Mujoco, I will look for the appropriate citation for Mujoco itself.

The citation for the Mujoco environments is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset/environment into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
