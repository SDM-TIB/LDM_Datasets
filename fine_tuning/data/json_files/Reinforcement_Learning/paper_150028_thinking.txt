To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Universal Framework for Generalized Run Time Assurance with JAX Automatic Differentiation" by Umberto Ravaioli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Safe Autonomy Run Time Assurance Framework and its validation through a simulation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **simulation section** in detail, as it often contains information about datasets used for validation. In this case, the authors describe a simulation of a multi-agent spacecraft inspection problem, but they do not specify any datasets used in the experiments. Instead, they refer to the dynamics and constraints of the spacecraft system.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various papers related to runtime assurance and control systems, but they do not appear to reference specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a framework and its application in simulations, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper.
