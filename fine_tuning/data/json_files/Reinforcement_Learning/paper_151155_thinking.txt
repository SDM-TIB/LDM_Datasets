To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Yize Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may mention datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on three well-known applications in quantum computing: **quantum state preparation, max-cut, and quantum chemistry**. I will look for specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these applications.

In the **appendices**, particularly Appendix A.2, the authors describe the settings for their experiments, including the generation of quantum circuits. They mention using a random circuit generator to create a set of circuit architectures, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. Instead, they refer to the Hamiltonians used for evaluating the circuits, which are derived from known problems in quantum computing.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that may correspond to datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments. However, it appears that the paper focuses more on methodologies and algorithms rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets:

1. **Quantum State Preparation**: The authors mention using a Hamiltonian for the molecule H2, but do not provide a specific dataset citation. The relevant reference for the Hamiltonian is:
   > Liang, Y.-C., Yeh, Y.-H., Mendonça, P. E. M. F., Teh, R. Y., Reid, M. D., & Drummond, P. D. (2019). Quantum fidelity measures for mixed states. Reports on Progress in Physics, 82(7), 076001. doi: 10.1088/1361-6633/ab1c7e.

2. **Max-Cut Problem**: The authors refer to using the max-cut problem and cite:
   > Poljak, S., & Rendl, F. (1995). Solving the max-cut problem using eigenvalues. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 62(1-3), 249–278. doi: 10.1016/0166-218X(94)00083-4.

3. **Quantum Chemistry**: The authors mention using a Hamiltonian for a transverse field Ising model, but again do not provide a specific dataset citation. The relevant reference for the VQE method is:
   > Peruzzo, A., McClean, J. R., Shadbolt, P., Yung, M.-H., Zhou, X.-Q., Love, P. J., Aspuru-Guzik, A., & O’Brien, J. L. (2014). A variational eigenvalue solver on a photonic quantum processor. Nature Communications, 5, 4213. doi: 10.1038/ncomms5213.

In conclusion, while the paper does not explicitly mention datasets in the traditional sense, it references Hamiltonians and problems that are foundational to the experiments conducted. I will compile these references into a structured format for clarity and future use.
