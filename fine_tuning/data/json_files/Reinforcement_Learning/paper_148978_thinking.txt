To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence of Finite Memory Q-Learning for POMDPs and Near Optimality of Learned Policies Under Filter Stability" by Ali Devran Kara and Serdar Yuksel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check there as well for any additional context or references to datasets that may not have been mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For each dataset, I will note down the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
