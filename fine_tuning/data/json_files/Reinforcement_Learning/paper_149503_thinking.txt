To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controlling Conditional Language Models without Catastrophic Forgetting" by Tomasz Korbak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks used in the study. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for specific references to datasets that the authors may have used to evaluate their proposed methods. This section often contains context about the datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Europarl Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the translation task. The authors mention that they sampled 5,000 English sentences from the English-French subcorpus of the Europarl dataset, version 7.

2. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is used for the summarization task. The authors state that they sampled 5,000 source documents from the train and test subsets for fine-tuning and evaluation.

3. **Python150 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of code generation experiments. The authors indicate that they extracted Python function signatures from this dataset, using 5,000 functions for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Europarl Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koehn, P. (2005). Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit X: Papers, 79–86.

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., dos Santos, C., Gulçehre, Ç., and Xiang, B. (2016). Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond. In Proceedings of The 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, 280–290.

- For the **Python150 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raychev, V., Bielik, P., and Vechev, M. (2016). Probabilistic model for code with decision trees. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 48, ICML’16, 2933–2942.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper while adhering to the importance of providing complete citations.
