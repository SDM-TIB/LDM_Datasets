To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Self-Play Algorithms Under a Generalized Framework" by Daniel Hernandez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that discuss experiments or evaluations, such as **section VII (Experimental Details)**. This section typically contains information about the environments and datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the authors mention using the **Repeated Imperfect Recall Rock Paper Scissors (RirRPS)** environment, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. The paper cites several works that may provide additional context or datasets relevant to their research.

For the **RirRPS environment**, I will note that it is described as a two-player, zero-sum game with specific rules and parameters. However, since it is not a traditional dataset but rather a game environment, I will ensure to document it appropriately.

After gathering this information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any referenced datasets or environments. If the paper does not provide explicit datasets but rather describes environments or algorithms, I will document those as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each entry includes the name of the dataset or environment, a brief description, and the full citation as required.
