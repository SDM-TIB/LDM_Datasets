To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Classification on Spoken Documents Using Deep Acoustic and Linguistic Features" by Tan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a subset of the Switchboard corpus, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Fisher English Corpus**: This dataset is described as a collection of recordings from conversational telephone speech, specifically mentioning that 900 hours of data were used to train the ASR, A2P, and P2W modules.

2. **Switchboard Telephone Speech Corpus**: The authors specify that all topic classification experiments were carried out on this corpus, which involves conversations on preselected topics. They also mention that a subset of this corpus was selected for their experiments, covering a total of 30 topics.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for any entries that correspond to the datasets mentioned. 

For the **Fisher English Corpus**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, so I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in speech recognition research but may need to be cited from another authoritative source if required.

For the **Switchboard Telephone Speech Corpus**, the citation is also not explicitly listed in the references, but it is widely recognized in the field. The original citation for the Switchboard corpus is:
> Godfrey, J. J., Holliman, E. C., & McDaniel, J. (1992). "SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1992.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their details, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have the correct citations for both datasets, even if they are not directly provided in the paper.
