To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel Estimation via Loss Field: Accurate Site-Trained Modeling for Shadowing Prediction" by Jie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use "extensive measurements" to validate their proposed model, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Evaluation Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Outdoor Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a university campus area measuring 2200 × 2100 m², using 25 software-defined radio (SDR) nodes. The paper specifies that the dataset is categorized into four types of receivers: Rooftop, Fixed, Mobile, and Dense. The details of the dataset are summarized in Table I.

2. **Indoor Dataset**: This dataset is collected from an indoor office area measuring 17.5 m × 15 m, with a total of 946 measurements taken between 44 device locations. The specifics of this dataset are also outlined in Table I.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Outdoor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Mitchell, “The frs/gmrs outdoor received power dataset,” https://zenodo.org/record/7259895#.ZDbPiezML0p, 2022.

- For the **Indoor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Patwari, “Indoor channel impulse response dataset,” https://crawdad.org/utah/CIR/20070910/matlab/, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and full citations of the datasets used in the paper, which are crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
