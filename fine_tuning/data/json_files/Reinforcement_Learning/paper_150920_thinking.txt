To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Experience Classification for Training Non-Markovian Tasks" by Ruixuan Miao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on benchmark problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated their approach on. They mention two specific problems: **Waterworld** and **Cartpole**. I will look for any details about datasets or environments used for these tasks.

In the experimental evaluation, the authors describe the **Waterworld problem** and the **Cartpole problem** in detail. They mention that the Waterworld problem involves randomly generated maps with different positions and speeds of balls, while the Cartpole problem is a classic reinforcement learning task. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these environments, as they are standard problems in reinforcement learning.

Since the paper does not cite any specific datasets but rather refers to established environments, I will note that the **Waterworld** and **Cartpole** problems are based on existing benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the environments or tasks mentioned. The references include works that describe the Cartpole problem and the DeepMind Control Suite, which is a collection of environments for reinforcement learning.

For the **Cartpole problem**, the relevant citation is:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A. et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

The **Waterworld problem** is described in the context of the paper but does not have a specific citation. It is often used as a benchmark in reinforcement learning literature, but the authors do not provide a formal reference for it in this paper.

In summary, I will document the following datasets based on the information extracted:

1. **Waterworld Problem**: A non-Markovian task environment used for evaluation, but no formal citation is provided.
2. **Cartpole Problem**: A standard reinforcement learning environment with the following citation:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A. et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
