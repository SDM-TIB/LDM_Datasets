To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Iberian Exception: An overview of its effects over its first 100 days" by D. Robinson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the relevant datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's focus, which may include mentions of data sources or datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion sections** to look for specific datasets that the authors may have utilized to support their findings. This includes any quantitative data presented in tables or figures, as well as any references to external datasets that were analyzed.

In particular, I will pay attention to any sections that discuss the **Iberian electricity market (MIBEL)** and the **hourly data published by the Iberian market operator (OMIE)**, as these are likely to be key datasets used in the analysis. The authors may also reference specific studies or reports that contain relevant data.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the original data sources. I will look for citations that provide details such as the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, if the paper mentions the **OMIE data**, I will look for the original source of this data, which may be a report or dataset published by the Iberian market operator. Similarly, if the authors reference any studies or datasets from other researchers, I will ensure to capture those citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations in a clear and organized manner. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, making it easy for others to understand the sources of data used in the research.
