To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Twin Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Admission Control in Sliced Network" by Zhenyu Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted extensive simulations, but they do not explicitly name any datasets in the experiments section. However, they do refer to parameters and configurations used in their simulations, which might imply the use of synthetic datasets or simulation environments rather than publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or methodologies that involve datasets. This could include foundational works or datasets that are commonly used in the field of deep reinforcement learning or network slicing.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will note that the paper relies on simulations and does not utilize specific datasets.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if applicable. If no datasets are found, I will summarize the findings accordingly.
