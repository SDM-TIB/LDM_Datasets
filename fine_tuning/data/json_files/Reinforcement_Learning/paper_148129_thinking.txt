To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composite Q-learning: Multi-scale Q-function Decomposition and Separable Optimization" by Gabriel Kalweit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in various simulated robot tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluations. I will look for any specific datasets used for training or testing their models. In this section, they mention applying their method to three robot simulation tasks: **Walker2d-v2, Hopper-v2, and Humanoid-v2**. This indicates that these environments are likely based on datasets or benchmarks used in reinforcement learning.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. The environments mentioned are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR, abs/1606.01540, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

Since the specific environments (Walker2d-v2, Hopper-v2, Humanoid-v2) are part of the OpenAI Gym, they do not have separate citations but are included in the citation for the Gym itself.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required.

1. **Walker2d-v2**: A simulated environment for a 2D bipedal walker, used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **Hopper-v2**: A simulated environment for a 2D hopping robot, also used for reinforcement learning evaluations.
3. **Humanoid-v2**: A more complex simulated environment for a humanoid robot, used for testing advanced reinforcement learning methods.

All these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit, which is cited above.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
