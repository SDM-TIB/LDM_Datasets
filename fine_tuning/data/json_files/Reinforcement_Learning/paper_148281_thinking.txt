To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Path Planners for Automated Driving" by Ekim Yurtsever et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **CARLA**, a dynamic urban simulation environment, which suggests that it may be a dataset or a simulation platform used for experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors describe using the **A* algorithm** for path planning and mention that the experiments were conducted in the CARLA simulation environment. This indicates that CARLA is a key component of their experimental setup.

In the **references section**, I will look for any citations related to CARLA or other datasets that may have been used in conjunction with the experiments. The paper cites CARLA as an open-source urban driving simulator, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for CARLA:

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from CARLA, I will conclude that CARLA is the primary dataset or simulation environment used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CARLA, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
