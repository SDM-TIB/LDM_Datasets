To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Track-Assignment Detailed Routing Using Attention-based Policy Model With Supervision" by Haiguang Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the significance of their work and may reference datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two types of analog design problems: 

1. **biasamp**: This dataset consists of comparators and OpAmps with less than 100 devices in each design. It is noted that the biasamp problems are randomly generated placement solutions and do not represent feasible designs for actual analog circuits.

2. **sarfsm**: This dataset is a subcircuit of an Analog-to-Digital Converter, containing hundreds of devices in each design. It is more complex than the biasamp dataset.

The authors also specify three distinct datasets generated from the biasamp and sarfsm problems:

- **biasamp500**: biasamp with 500 device configurations.
- **biasamp5000**: biasamp with 5000 device configurations.
- **sarfsm500**: sarfsm with 500 device configurations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated from the authors' own work and not from external sources, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note the context in which they were created.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, while also noting that they are derived from the authors' own experimental setups.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
