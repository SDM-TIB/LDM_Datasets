To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DoCoGen: Domain Counterfactual Generation for Low Resource Domain Adaptation" by Nitay Calderon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors use D-CONs (domain-counterfactual textual examples) generated by their algorithm to augment a sentiment classifier and a multi-label intent classifier. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their names and details.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the tasks and datasets used. They mention two main tasks: sentiment classification and multi-label intent prediction. 

For sentiment classification, they refer to several domains, including:
1. **Airline (A)**: The authors mention using a dataset of airline reviews.
2. **DVDs (D)**: This refers to a dataset of DVD reviews.
3. **Electronics (E)**: This dataset consists of electronics product reviews.
4. **Kitchen (K)**: This dataset includes reviews of kitchen appliances.
5. **Books (B)**: This dataset is related to book reviews.
6. **Restaurant (R)**: This dataset is derived from the Yelp dataset challenge.

For the multi-label intent prediction task, they mention the **MANtIS dataset**, which consists of diverse conversations from the Stack Exchange portal, annotated with user intent utterances.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. **Airline Dataset**: 
   > Quang Nguyen. *The airline review dataset*. 2015. [Link to dataset if available]

2. **DVD Dataset**: 
   > John Blitzer, Ryan T. McDonald, and Fernando Pereira. *Domain adaptation for sentiment classification*. In ACL 2007, Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, June 23-30, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic.

3. **Electronics Dataset**:

6. **Restaurant Dataset**: 
   > Zhang, W., et al. *Yelp dataset challenge*. 2015. [Link to dataset if available]

7. **MANtIS Dataset**: 
   > Gustavo Penha, Alexandru Balan, and Claudia Hauff. *Introducing mantis: a novel multi-domain information seeking dialogues dataset*. CoRR, abs/1912.04639.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
