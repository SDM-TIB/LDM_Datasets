To extract datasets from the research paper titled "University of Copenhagen Participation in TREC Health Misinformation Track 2020" by Lucas Chaves Lima et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the authors' participation in the TREC Health Misinformation Track, which suggests that datasets related to health misinformation are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of information retrieval systems in combating misinformation. They mention the TREC Health Misinformation Track, which indicates that specific datasets are used for the tasks outlined in the paper.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors refer to the **Microsoft Credibility dataset** and the **Fake News Challenge-1 dataset** as sources for training their classifiers. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Microsoft Credibility dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Schwarz and M. R. Morris. *Augmenting web pages and search results to support credibility assessment*. In ACM Conference on Computer-Human Interaction, May 2011. URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/augmenting-web-pages-and-search-results-to-support-credibility-assessment/.

2. For the **Fake News Challenge-1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Fake News Challenge. *Fake News Challenge-1 Dataset*. Available at: http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
