To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Sparse R-CNN" by Qinghang Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experiments are conducted on the **COCO 2017 dataset**, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that all experiments are conducted on the **COCO 2017 dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the number of categories it labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
