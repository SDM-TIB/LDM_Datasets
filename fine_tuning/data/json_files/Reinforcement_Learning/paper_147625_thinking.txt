To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Stochastic Approximation: Constant Step-Size and Iterate Averaging" by Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan and Csaba Szepesv√°ri, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources that are used in their research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **results** or **discussion** section, I will also check there for any references to datasets, as authors may discuss the implications of their findings in relation to specific datasets.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a brief search to find the authoritative source for that dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I maintain academic rigor in the citation process.
