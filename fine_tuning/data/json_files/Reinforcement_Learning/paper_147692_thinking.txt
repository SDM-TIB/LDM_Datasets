To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Macro-Actions" by Ishan P. Durugkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on different Atari 2600 games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors detail their experiments. They mention training agents on **8 games** from the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**. This indicates that the ALE serves as a dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment, as it is the primary dataset used in their experiments. The citation for the ALE is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 06 2013.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference various Atari games, but they do not provide separate datasets for each game; instead, they utilize the ALE as a comprehensive dataset that encompasses multiple games.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment, as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured appropriately for any downstream processing or review.
