To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Contrastive Divergence with Generative Replay: Experience Replay without Storing Data" by Decebal Constantin Mocanu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method on **9 real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists the characteristics of the datasets, including their names, domains, features, and sample sizes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 784 features, containing 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
2. **ADULT**: A dataset related to household income classification with 123 features, containing 5,000 training samples and 26,147 test samples.
3. **Connect4**: A dataset for game classification with 126 features, containing 16,000 training samples and 47,557 test samples.
4. **DNA**: A biological dataset with 180 features, containing 1,400 training samples and 1,186 test samples.
5. **UCI Mushrooms**: A dataset for mushroom classification with 112 features, containing 2,000 training samples and 5,624 test samples.
6. **NIPS-0-12**: A dataset from the NIPS conference with 500 features, containing 32,152 training samples and 1,000 test samples.
7. **OCR-letters**: A dataset for optical character recognition with 128 features, containing 40,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
8. **RCV1**: A dataset for text classification with 150 features, containing 140,000 training samples and 150,000 test samples.
9. **Web**: A dataset related to web documents with 300 features, containing 14,000 training samples and 32,561 test samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are well-known datasets in the machine learning community. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are commonly referenced in the literature.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, their properties, and any relevant details as needed for future processing or review.
