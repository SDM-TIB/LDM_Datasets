To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimum Coverage Sets for Training Robust Ad Hoc Teamwork Agents" by Muhammad Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 6 (Experiments)**, where they detail the environments used for testing their methods. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets or environments that were utilized.

In **section 6.1 (Environments)**, the authors mention four environments used for their experiments:

1. **Repeated Matrix Game**: This is a simple environment without states, and the authors describe the heuristics used for agent behavior.
   
2. **Cooperative Reaching**: This environment involves agents moving towards corner cells, and the authors outline various heuristics for agent behavior.

3. **Weighted Cooperative Reaching**: Similar to Cooperative Reaching but with a modified reward function, the authors again describe the heuristics used.

4. **Level-based Foraging**: This environment involves agents collecting items, and the authors provide details on the heuristics for agent behavior.

While these environments are not traditional datasets, they are crucial for understanding the experimental setup and the data generated during the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets or environments are cited with full citations. The authors may reference foundational works or datasets that are relevant to their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the details of each environment, including any relevant citations, into a structured format. The citations for the environments or heuristics will be crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the environments and any associated citations, preparing them for inclusion in the final output.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to identify environments used.
3. Checking the references for any relevant citations.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format with full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned.

This systematic approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
