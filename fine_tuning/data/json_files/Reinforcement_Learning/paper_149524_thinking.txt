To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Space Non-cooperative Object Active Tracking with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Dong Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an active visual tracking method and mentions "extensive experiments" but does not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the significance of active visual tracking for space non-cooperative objects. They reference various methods and previous works but do not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, particularly the part where they describe the simulation environment, I will look for any specific datasets or models used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention constructing a simulation environment with **18 types of space non-cooperative object models**. This indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments, but I need to find the exact details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their evaluation methods and metrics but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention that the simulation environment is available and open-source on GitHub, which suggests that the dataset can be accessed there.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the datasets or models they used. I will look for any references that might provide full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets or models referenced. The key datasets I will focus on are:

1. **Simulation Environment Dataset**: This dataset consists of 18 types of space non-cooperative object models used for training and evaluation. The authors mention that it is available on GitHub, which I will note.

2. **Reference Citations**: I will ensure to include any relevant citations from the references that describe the datasets or models used in their experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
