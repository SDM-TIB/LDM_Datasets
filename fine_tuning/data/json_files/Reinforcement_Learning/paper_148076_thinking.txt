To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Reinforcement Learning â€” a New Continuous Reinforcement Learning Frame Based on Stochastic Differential Equation methods" by Tianhao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its advantages but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various reinforcement learning methods and their applications but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **experiments section** to look for any datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments using three environments: **Pendulum-v0, MountainCarContinuous-v0, and CartPole-v1** from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that these environments are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Pendulum-v0**: 
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

2. **MountainCarContinuous-v0**: 
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

3. **CartPole-v1**: 
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Since all three environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, they share the same citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for the datasets used in the research paper.
