To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Characterisation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search Performance in Different Games" by Dennis J.N.J. Soemers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built an initial dataset consisting of **268,386 plays among 61 different agents across 1494 distinct games**. This suggests that there is a significant dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will examine **Section II (Dataset)**, which is likely to provide detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the dataset's composition, including the number of plays, agents, and games. They mention that the dataset consists of outcomes from **268,386 plays** involving **61 different agents** across **1494 distinct games**, and that each game is represented by **809 features**. This section will be crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and characteristics.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors refer to their dataset as an "initial dataset" but do not provide a specific name. However, they do mention that the dataset is generated using the **Ludii framework**, which is important for citation purposes.

After gathering the necessary information from the dataset section, I will check the **References section** to find any relevant citations for the dataset or the framework used to create it. The authors cite the Ludii framework in reference [11], which is essential for providing a complete citation for the dataset.

The citation for the Ludii framework is:
> E. Piette, D. J. N. J. Soemers, M. Stephenson, C. F. Sironi, M. H. M. Winands, and C. Browne. *Ludii – the ludemic general game system*. In Proceedings of the 24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, vol. 325, pp. 411–418, IOS Press, 2020.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset description and the full citation for the Ludii framework. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's context and its source.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights into the dataset.
2. Analyze Section II (Dataset) for detailed information about the dataset's structure and characteristics.
3. Check the References section for citations related to the dataset and the Ludii framework.
4. Document the dataset description and citation clearly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset from the research paper.
