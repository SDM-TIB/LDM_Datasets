To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules" by Yanzhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their approach on various sequence generation tasks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention four representative sequence generation tasks: natural language generation, SQL query generation, summarization, and task-oriented dialogue modeling. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors detail the specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **E2E NLG Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language generation tasks. It is referenced as a challenge for end-to-end generation.
   
2. **RNNLG Dataset**: This dataset includes various domains such as restaurant, hotel, TV, and laptop, which are used for similar tasks in the experiments.

3. **WikiSQL Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for SQL query generation tasks.

4. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is employed for news article summarization tasks.

5. **MultiWOZ Dataset**: This dataset is used for task-oriented dialogue modeling.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **E2E NLG Dataset**:
  > Jekaterina Novikova, Ondřej Dušek, and Verena Rieser. *The e2e dataset: New challenges for end-to-end generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.09254, 2017.

  > Victor Zhong, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. *Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.00103, 2017.

  > Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1073–1083, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017.

- For **MultiWOZ Dataset**:
  > Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Inigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gašić. *Multiwoz–a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
