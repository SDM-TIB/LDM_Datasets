To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoSparse: Towards Automated Sparse Training of Deep Neural Networks" by Abhisek Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on **ImageNet-1K**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5) to confirm the datasets used. The authors specifically mention that they show sparse training results on **ImageNet-1K** for two popular CNN architectures: **ResNet50** and **MobileNetV1**. This confirms that **ImageNet-1K** is indeed a dataset utilized in their work.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or if there are any additional datasets used in the context of their experiments. However, the primary focus appears to be on **ImageNet-1K**.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **ImageNet-1K** dataset from the references section:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2009.

After confirming the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset used in the research.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for confirmation of datasets used.
3. Check the references for full citations of the datasets mentioned.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for **ImageNet-1K** based on the information gathered.
