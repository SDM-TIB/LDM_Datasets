To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harissa: Stochastic Simulation and Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks Based on Transcriptional Bursting" by Ulysse Herbach, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **usage section** where the author describes the functionalities of the Harissa package. Here, the author mentions that the package can be used for network inference from time-course single-cell datasets, specifically scRNA-seq data. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific references to any datasets.

In the **appendices**, particularly in the section discussing the inference algorithm, the author refers to time-course single-cell datasets and mentions that the inference can be performed using a dataset structured as a matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column corresponds to a cell. However, no specific dataset names are provided.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the experiments or methods used. The references include various studies that may have utilized datasets relevant to the research, but again, I need to identify specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I find that while the author discusses the use of scRNA-seq data, there are no specific datasets named or cited in the text. The paper focuses more on the methodology and the capabilities of the Harissa package rather than detailing specific datasets.

Since no explicit datasets are mentioned, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**: While the paper discusses the use of scRNA-seq data for network inference, it does not specify any particular dataset or provide a citation.

In conclusion, I will note that the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, which limits the ability to extract detailed dataset information. If I were to create entries based on the information available, I would indicate the general type of data used (scRNA-seq) but would not be able to provide full citations for specific datasets.
