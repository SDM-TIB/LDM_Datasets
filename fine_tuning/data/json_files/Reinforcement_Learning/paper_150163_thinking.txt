To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning for General-sum Low-rank Markov Games" by Chengzhuo Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that may have utilized specific datasets. This section typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics that the authors provide.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets easily.

For this paper, I anticipate finding the following datasets:

1. **Block MDP Dataset**: This dataset is likely used for evaluating the proposed algorithms in the context of low-rank Markov games. I will look for details about its structure and citation.

2. **General-sum Markov Game Dataset**: This dataset may be referenced in relation to the experiments conducted to validate the proposed methods. I will ensure to capture its details and citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will format this information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
