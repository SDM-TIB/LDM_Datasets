To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting High-dimensional Nonlinear Optimization with Conditional GANs" by Pouya Rezazadeh Kalehbasti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the use of a conditional GAN to augment solutions from a genetic algorithm, it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of high-dimensional nonlinear optimization and the proposed method. Here, they mention the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a conditional GAN (C-GAN) but do not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training the C-GAN or for the optimization problem. The authors describe the optimization problem in detail, including the decision variables and constraints, but they do not name any datasets directly. However, they mention that the GA generates a total of **65,610 solutions**, which could be considered a dataset for the optimization problem.

In the **experiments section**, the authors outline six experiments conducted using subsets of the generated solutions. They refer to these subsets as training sets for the C-GAN but do not provide formal names for these datasets. Instead, they describe the conditions under which these subsets were created (e.g., "WorstHalfGHG," "BestHalfAll"). 

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **results section** for any additional context or references to datasets. The authors present results based on the generated solutions and compare them to the original solutions produced by the GA, but again, they do not provide formal citations for any datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to identify any external datasets that may have been used in the study. However, the references primarily cite previous works related to optimization and GANs rather than specific datasets.

Based on my review, I will document the following dataset:

1. **Generated Solutions Dataset**: This dataset consists of the **65,610 solutions** generated by the genetic algorithm for the optimization problem. While it does not have a formal citation, it is crucial to note that this dataset is central to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will summarize the findings and ensure that the generated solutions dataset is clearly documented.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
