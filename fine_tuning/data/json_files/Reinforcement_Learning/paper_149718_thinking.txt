To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hysteresis-Based RL: Robustifying Reinforcement Learning-based Control Policies via Hybrid Control" by Jan de Priester et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **examples section (Section III)**, where the authors describe two specific control problems. Here, they mention using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms, but I need to look for any datasets associated with these methods. 

In the examples, the authors refer to two specific problems: 
1. **Unit Circle Problem**: They mention using PPO for this example, but they do not specify a dataset. Instead, they describe the dynamics and control policies derived from the algorithm.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance Problem**: Similarly, they mention using DQN for this example without referencing a specific dataset.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to reinforcement learning and control policies, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. 

Given that the paper focuses on the development of a new algorithm (HyRL) and its application to control problems rather than on specific datasets, it appears that there are no datasets to extract for this paper.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning methods and presents examples, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile for this paper.
