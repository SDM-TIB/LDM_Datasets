To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-scale Traffic Signal Control" by Tianshu Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluated their methods in two environments: a **synthetic traffic grid** and a **real-world traffic network of Monaco city**. I need to determine if these environments are based on specific datasets or if they are simulations.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors used the **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** simulator for their experiments. This indicates that the traffic scenarios were generated using this simulator, which is a widely used tool for traffic simulation. However, I need to check if the authors provide any specific datasets or references related to the traffic scenarios they created.

In the **references section**, I will look for any citations related to the SUMO simulator or any specific datasets that were used to create the traffic scenarios. The authors mention a specific reference for the Monaco traffic network:

- For the **Monaco SUMO Traffic (MoST) Scenario**, the citation is:
  > L. Codeca and J. HÃ¤rri. *Monaco SUMO Traffic (MoST) Scenario: A 3D Mobility Scenario for Cooperative ITS*. In SUMO 2018, SUMO User Conference, Simulating Autonomous and Intermodal Transport Systems, May 14-16, 2018, Berlin, Germany.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the synthetic traffic grid. If the authors do not provide a specific dataset citation for the synthetic grid, I will note that it is a simulated environment without a formal dataset reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
