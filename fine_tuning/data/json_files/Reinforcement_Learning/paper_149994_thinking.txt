To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Soft Actor-Critic: A Directed Acyclic Strategy Graph Based Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Qin Yang and Ramviyas Parasuraman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method against state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms on standard continuous control benchmarks in the OpenAI Gym environment. This suggests that datasets related to these benchmarks may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention using three standard continuous control benchmark domains: **Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Humanoid-v2**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the paper. The authors describe the policies and actions associated with each benchmark, but they do not provide specific dataset citations within the text. However, since these benchmarks are well-known, I can find their citations from external sources.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Hopper-v2**: The citation for the Hopper-v2 environment is typically associated with the OpenAI Gym:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

2. **Walker2d-v2**: This environment is also part of the OpenAI Gym:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

3. **Humanoid-v2**: Similarly, this environment is included in the OpenAI Gym:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

Since all three datasets are part of the same OpenAI Gym framework, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
