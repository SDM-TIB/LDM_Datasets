To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Growing Q-Networks: Solving Continuous Control Tasks with Adaptive Control Resolution" by Tim Seyde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their approach on tasks from the **DeepMind Control Suite**, **MetaWorld**, and **MyoSuite**. These are key indicators that datasets are involved.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, dimensions, and any relevant statistics. For example, the authors discuss the action dimensionality and the nature of the tasks in the context of these datasets, which will help me understand their scope and application.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
> Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., Liu, S., Bohez, S., Merel, J., Erez, T., Lillicrap, T., Heess, N., & Tassa, Y. (2020). *dm control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6, 100022.

For **MetaWorld**, the citation is:
> Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2020). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1094–1100). PMLR.

For **MyoSuite**, the citation is:
> Vittorio, C., Wang, H., Durandau, G., Sartori, M., & Kumar, V. (2022). *Myosuite – a contact-rich simulation suite for musculoskeletal motor control*. Retrieved from https://github.com/myohub/myosuite.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
