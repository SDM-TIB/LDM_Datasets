To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Double Q-learning with Conservative Advantage Learning for Actor-Critic Methods" by Qing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on continuous control benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to benchmark tasks. In this section, the authors mention that they compare their method against various continuous control tasks from **OpenAI Gym** and **DeepMind Control Suite**.

I will also check the **tables** within the experiments section, particularly Table I, which lists the environments used for evaluation. The environments mentioned include:

1. **Ant-v2**
2. **HalfCheetah-v2**
3. **Humanoid-v2**
4. **Walker2d-v2**
5. **finger-spin**
6. **point mass-easy**
7. **quadruped-run**
8. **swimmer-swimmer6**
9. **walker-run**

These environments are part of the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmark environments mentioned. The references may provide additional context or original sources for the datasets used in the experiments.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following citations:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **DeepMind Control Suite**:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., d. L. Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Now, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
