To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Laws for a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Model" by Oren Neumann and Claudius Gros, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of AlphaZero agents trained on the games **Connect Four** and **Pentago**, which suggests that these games may be the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setting** section (Section 4) to confirm the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe the training of agents using the AlphaZero algorithm on the two games. They provide details about the games, including their mechanics and the training process, which indicates that both **Connect Four** and **Pentago** are indeed the datasets utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **results** section (Section 5) to see if there are any additional details or references to the datasets. The authors discuss the performance scaling of agents trained on these games, reinforcing that the datasets are the games themselves.

Finally, I will look at the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets. Since the datasets in this case are the games themselves, I will provide citations for the relevant papers or resources that describe these games:

1. **Connect Four**: The citation for the solver used in the experiments is:
   > Pascal Pons. *Connect Four Solver*. 2015. URL: [gamesolver.org](http://gamesolver.org).

2. **Pentago**: The citation for the solver used in the experiments is:
   > Geoffrey Irving. *Pentago is a First Player Win: Strongly Solving a Game Using Parallel In-Core Retrograde Analysis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.0743, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
