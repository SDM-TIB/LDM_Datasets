To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ER-FSL: Experience Replay with Feature Subspace Learning for Online Continual Learning" by Huiwei Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of ER-FSL," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: **Split CIFAR10**, **Split CIFAR100**, and **Split MiniImageNet**. I will note these names down as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Split CIFAR10**: 
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

2. **Split CIFAR100**: 
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

3. **Split MiniImageNet**: 
   > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D. (2016). *Matching networks for one shot learning*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 29, 3630-3638.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
