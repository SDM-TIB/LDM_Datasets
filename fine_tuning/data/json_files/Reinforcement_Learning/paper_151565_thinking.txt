To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Biomedical Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Self-Rewarding Tree Search and Proximal Policy Optimization" by Minda Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference the **BioASQ-QA dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they describe the **BioASQ-QA dataset** as a comprehensive resource designed for biomedical professionals, including questions and gold-enriched answers, which is crucial for their retrieval-augmented generation approach.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BioASQ-QA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Anastasios Krithara, Anastasios Nentidis, Konstantinos Bougiatiotis, and Georgios Paliouras. *BioASQ: A Manually Curated Corpus for Biomedical Question Answering*. Scientific Data, 10(1):170, 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **BioASQ-QA Dataset**: A dataset designed for biomedical question answering, featuring questions and expert-generated answers, which is updated annually.

I will ensure that the final output includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for clarity and completeness.
