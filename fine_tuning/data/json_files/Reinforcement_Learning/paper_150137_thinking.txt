To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sufficient Exploration for Convex Q-learning" by Fan Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted using OpenAI Gym environments, as the authors indicate that they illustrate their theory with applications to examples from OpenAI Gym. I will check if they mention specific environments like "Mountain Car," "CartPole," or "Acrobot," which are common benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Mountain Car" environment, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced this dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
