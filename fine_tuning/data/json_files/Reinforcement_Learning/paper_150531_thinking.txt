To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collection Space Navigator: An Interactive Visualization Interface for Multidimensional Datasets" by Tillmann Ohm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and applications sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Collection Space Navigator (CSN) as a tool for exploring large collections of visual digital artifacts, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe three distinct use cases that likely involve datasets:

1. **Analyzing aesthetic complexity in art collections**: The authors mention using a subset of 74,028 works from the art500k project corpus, sourced from Wikiart. This indicates a specific dataset related to visual art.

2. **Studying represented worldviews in historical newsreels**: The authors refer to a dataset consisting of 1,747 newsreels produced weekly over 50 years in the Soviet Union. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

3. **Exploration and curation of text-to-image models**: The authors discuss generating images with Stable Diffusion using the Automated Similarity Judgement Program (ASJP) as input prompts. While this is more about the methodology, it implies the use of a dataset related to text-to-image generation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **art500k project corpus**, the citation is:
  > Mao, Hui, Ming Cheung, and James She. "Deepart: Learning joint representations of visual arts." In Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia, pp. 1183–1191, 2017.

- For the **historical newsreels dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is based on the authors' forthcoming work, which may not yet have a formal citation.

- For the **Automated Similarity Judgement Program (ASJP)**, the citation is:
  > Brown, Cecil H., Eric W. Holman, Søren Wichmann, and Viveka Velupillai. "Automated classification of the world’s languages: a description of the method and preliminary results." Language Typology and Universals 61.4 (2008): 285–308.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
