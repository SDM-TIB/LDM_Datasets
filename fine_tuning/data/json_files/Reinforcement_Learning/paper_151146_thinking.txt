To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconciling Spatial and Temporal Abstractions for Goal Representation" by Mehdi Zadem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm and mention evaluating it on "complex continuous control tasks." This suggests that specific datasets are likely used, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**. Here, they mention three specific tasks: **Ant Maze**, **Ant Fall**, and **Ant Maze Cam**. Each of these tasks is associated with a simulated environment for evaluating their algorithm.

Now, I will gather the details about these tasks:

1. **Ant Maze**: A task where the ant must navigate a maze to reach a specific exit position.
2. **Ant Fall**: A task where the ant must cross a chasm using a movable block as a bridge.
3. **Ant Maze Cam**: A more complex version of the Ant Maze, where the ant must interact with a camera to unlock a passage.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets or environments used. The authors reference the environments adapted from previous works, specifically mentioning:

- **Ant Maze, Ant Fall**: Adapted from Duan et al. (2016).
- **Ant Maze Cam**: A new task introduced in this paper.

The full citation for the original environments is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

1. **Ant Maze**: 
   - Citation: Duan, Y., Chen, X., Houthooft, R., Schulman, J., & Abbeel, P. (2016). Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for continuous control. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

2. **Ant Fall**:

3. **Ant Maze Cam**: 
   - Citation: Zadem, M., Mover, S., & Nguyen, S. M. (2024). Reconciling Spatial and Temporal Abstractions for Goal Representation. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
