To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding" by Zhiyu Mou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning in auto-bidding, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using data collected from a real-world advertising system (RAS) and a simulated advertising system (s-RAS). However, they do not specify named datasets in the traditional sense, as they are using proprietary data from their own systems.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information on datasets. The paper mentions that the data used in the simulated experiments is based on historical data generated in the RAS, but again, specific dataset names are not provided.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the data is proprietary and specific to the authors' experiments. However, I will still provide the citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for referencing the source of the data.

The citation for the paper is:
> Zhiyu Mou, Yusen Huo, Rongquan Bai, Mingzhou Xie, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng. *Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding*. In Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).

In summary, while I cannot extract traditional dataset names from this paper, I will document the proprietary nature of the data used and provide the full citation for the paper itself. This will ensure that any future references to the data can be traced back to its source.
