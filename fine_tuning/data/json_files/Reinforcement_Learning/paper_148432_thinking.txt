To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Think Too Fast Nor Too Slow: The Computational Trade-off Between Planning And Reinforcement Learning" by Thomas M. Moerland et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the AlphaZero algorithm and its performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to confirm this in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the tasks used for their experiments. They mention using three well-known control tasks: **CartPole**, **MountainCar**, and **RaceCar**. This indicates that these tasks are likely associated with specific datasets or environments.

In this section, the authors specify that the **CartPole** and **MountainCar** tasks are available from the **OpenAI Gym**, and the **RaceCar** task is available in the **PyBullet package**. This gives me the names of the datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. For the **PyBullet package**, the citation is:
   > Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai. *Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. GitHub repository, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for review or further processing.
