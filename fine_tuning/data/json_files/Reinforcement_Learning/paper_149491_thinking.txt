To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-objective Explanations of GNN Predictions" by Yifei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study. I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section V in this case) where the authors usually describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, and features. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table II) that lists nine networks from four application domains, which is crucial for my dataset extraction.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, used for predicting research areas.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,321 nodes and 4,552 edges.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,324 edges.
4. **Musae-Facebook (Musae-F)**: A social network dataset with 13,752 nodes and 18,333 edges.
5. **Musae-Github (Musae-G)**: Another social network dataset with 7,650 nodes and 34,493 edges.
6. **Amazon-Computer (Amazon-C)**: A co-purchase graph with 10,556 nodes and 342,004 edges.
7. **Amazon-Photo (Amazon-P)**: Another co-purchase graph with 9,196 nodes and 578,006 edges.
8. **Coauthor-Computer (Coauthor-C)**: A co-authorship graph with 18,333 nodes and 327,576 edges.
9. **Coauthor-Physics (Coauthor-P)**: Another co-authorship graph with 34,493 nodes and 991,848 edges.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution to the original sources of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > McCallum, A., & Koller, D. (2001). *Probabilistic models for information extraction from text*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that clearly delineates each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the original sources.
