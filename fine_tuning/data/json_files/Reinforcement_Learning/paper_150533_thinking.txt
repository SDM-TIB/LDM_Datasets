To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamically Conservative Self-Driving Planner for Long-Tail Cases" by Weitao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the challenges faced by self-driving vehicles (SDVs) in "long-tail" cases and mentions the use of the CARLA simulator for evaluation. This suggests that there may be datasets or simulation environments referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or datasets used. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any historical driving data or training datasets that the authors might have utilized. 

In the **experiments** section, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the scenarios created in the CARLA simulator, as well as the details about the driving cases generated for testing. The authors mention generating 300 driving cases based on randomized parameters, which indicates that there is a dataset involved in this process.

I will also check the **references** section to find any citations related to datasets or methodologies that are referenced in the paper. This may include foundational datasets used in the context of autonomous driving or specific datasets that the authors have created or utilized in their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This should be clearly stated in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: I will extract the complete reference for each dataset from the references section of the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using the CARLA simulator, I will look for the citation that describes the CARLA simulator and its datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
