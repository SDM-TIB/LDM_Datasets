To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Critic PI2: Master Continuous Planning via Policy Improvement with Path Integrals and Deep Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning" by Jiajun Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on inverted pendulum models, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on two tasks: **InvertedPendulum** and **InvertedDoublePendulum**. I will look for specific details about these tasks, including any references to datasets or benchmarks.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide more context about the environments used for their experiments. They describe the **InvertedPendulum** and **InvertedDoublePendulum** environments, detailing the observation and action spaces, as well as the reward functions. However, they do not explicitly cite any external datasets, as these environments are likely part of the OpenAI Gym framework.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any relevant papers or resources that describe these environments. The paper mentions the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized platform for reinforcement learning environments.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will include this citation as the reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used in the experiments. This will provide a clear and accurate representation of the datasets referenced in the paper.
