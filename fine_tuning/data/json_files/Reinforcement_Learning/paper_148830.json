Available actions are up, down, right, and left, with which the agent transitions to the corresponding neighboring state, if possible. If the agent bumps into a wall — which is considered unsafe — the episode terminates and the new episode begins in the preceding state. Rewards are 0 for moving around and +10 if the goal is reached.",
