To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Q-learning With Imperfect Expert Demonstrations" by Fengdi Che et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention testing their algorithm on a sparse-reward chain environment called **DeepSea** and six Atari games. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these environments.

In the **experiments subsection 6.1**, the authors describe the **DeepSea** environment in detail, explaining its structure and the rewards associated with it. This environment is crucial for understanding the dataset used for their experiments.

In subsection 6.2, the authors list the **Arcade Learning Environments** they evaluated their approach on, specifically mentioning the games: **Breakout, ChopperCommand, Freeway, MsPacman, VideoPinball, and Seaquest**. Each of these games serves as a dataset for testing their algorithm.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations for the environments and datasets are as follows:

1. **DeepSea Environment**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this environment, but it is based on the work by Osband et al. (2019). Therefore, I will cite that paper:
   > Ian Osband, Benjamin Van Roy, Daniel J Russo, Zheng Wen, et al. *Deep exploration via randomized value functions*. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 20(124):1â€“62, 2019.

2. **Atari Games**: The authors reference the Arcade Learning Environment, which is associated with the following citation:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
