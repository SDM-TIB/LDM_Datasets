To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recruitment-imitation Mechanism for Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning" by Shuai Lü et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their proposed method. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains explicit mentions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for subsections that might be titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup," where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will also check this part for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors compare their results across different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Mujoco** environment for their experiments, I will look for the original citation of Mujoco in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026–5033.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
