To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Placement Optimization of Aerial Base Stations with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jin Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of UAVs as aerial base stations and mentions a "3D Terrain Map," which could imply the use of a dataset related to terrain or geographical data.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss various algorithms and methods but do not explicitly mention datasets at this point. I will then look into the **system model** and **problem formulation** sections, where they describe the coverage bitmap and the 3D Terrain Map. The mention of a "3D Terrain Map" suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors provide details about the parameters used in their experiments, including the number of ground users (GUs) and UAVs, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, they do mention that the terrain map is generated for a specific environment with 30 buildings and 80 GUs, which indicates that they likely used a custom dataset for their simulations.

To find the full citation for the datasets, I will check the **references section**. The references may include works that describe the datasets or methodologies used to create the datasets. I will look for any references that discuss the 3D Terrain Map or similar datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that there are no explicit citations for a dataset named "3D Terrain Map." However, I can infer that the authors likely created this dataset based on their own simulations or used publicly available datasets related to terrain mapping.

In summary, the key datasets identified from the paper are:

1. **3D Terrain Map**: This dataset is used to model the environment for the UAV placement optimization. While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is crucial for the experiments conducted.

2. **Ground User Locations**: The paper mentions 80 GUs randomly located within the 3D Terrain Map, but again, no specific dataset citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that the 3D Terrain Map is likely a custom dataset created for the study, and the ground user locations are part of the experimental setup.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format for further processing.
