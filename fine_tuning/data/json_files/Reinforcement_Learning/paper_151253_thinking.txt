To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VADv2: End-to-End Vectorized Autonomous Driving via Probabilistic Planning" by Shaoyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that VADv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **CARLA Town05 benchmark**, which indicates that this benchmark is likely a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors specify that they used the **CARLA simulator** to collect training data, which includes approximately 3 million frames from various driving routes in Town03, Town04, Town06, Town07, and Town10. This indicates that the CARLA simulator is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1â€“16. PMLR, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to "large-scale driving demonstrations" but do not specify a distinct dataset name for these demonstrations. Therefore, I will focus on the CARLA dataset as the primary dataset used in their work.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CARLA Town05 Benchmark**: This is a benchmark dataset used for evaluating the performance of VADv2, derived from the CARLA simulator.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset in the final output. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
