To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Deep RL Models Into Interpretable Neuro-Fuzzy Systems" by Arne Gevaert, Jonathan Peck, and Yvan Saeys, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed algorithm on "three well-known environments from OpenAI Gym," which suggests that these environments may be the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **methods** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any specific mentions of datasets or environments used in the experiments. In the results section, the authors explicitly mention the three environments: **CartPole**, **MountainCar**, and **LunarLander**. This confirms that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the citation related to OpenAI Gym in the references. The relevant citation is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, John Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. "OpenAI Gym." June 2016.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CartPole**: An environment where the agent must balance a pole on a cart by applying forces.
2. **MountainCar**: An environment where the agent drives a car up a hill, requiring momentum to reach the goal.
3. **LunarLander**: An environment where the agent controls a spaceship to land on a platform.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, which encompasses all three environments.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their citations.
