To extract datasets from the research paper titled "First Order Constrained Optimization in Policy Space" by Yiming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically details the methodologies employed and the datasets utilized for testing the proposed methods. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets, allowing others to locate them easily.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the experiments conducted on robotic locomotion tasks, as these are likely to be the primary datasets referenced. I will note any datasets that are mentioned, such as those from the OpenAI Gym or other relevant sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
