To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prototypical Q Networks for Automatic Conversational Diagnosis and Few-Shot New Disease Adaption" by Hongyin Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created both supervised and few-shot learning tasks with the **Muzhi corpus**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Data and Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Muzhi dataset**. They describe it as containing 710 medical dialogs between real doctors and patients, annotated with user goals covering 4 different diseases and 66 symptoms. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Muzhi dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Muzhi dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei, Z., Liu, Q., Peng, B., Tou, H., Chen, T., Huang, X., Wong, K.-F., & Dai, X. (2018). Task-oriented dialogue system for automatic diagnosis. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), 2018, pp. 201â€“207.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references for proper attribution.

With this information, I can now proceed to create the dataset entry as needed.
