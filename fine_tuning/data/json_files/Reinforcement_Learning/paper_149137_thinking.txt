To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Donâ€™t Get Yourself into Trouble! Risk-aware Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles" by Kasra Mokhtari and Alan R. Wagner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a risk-based decision-making framework and mentions evaluating the method in a high-fidelity simulation, specifically CARLA, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to their previous work and mention the "Pedestrian Patterns Dataset" in the context of risk assessment for autonomous vehicles. This indicates that this dataset is relevant to their research.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the experimental setup, the authors describe using CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving scenarios. They mention that they designed paths and traversals for the simulation, but they do not specify any additional datasets beyond the previously mentioned "Pedestrian Patterns Dataset."

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the "Pedestrian Patterns Dataset." The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **Pedestrian Patterns Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Mokhtari and A. R. Wagner. "The pedestrian patterns dataset." AAAI Fall 2019 Symposium, 2019.

Since CARLA is a simulation environment and not a dataset per se, I will not include it in the dataset extraction. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the "Pedestrian Patterns Dataset" using the required citation format.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
