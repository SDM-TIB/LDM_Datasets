To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S4RL: Surprisingly Simple Self-Supervision for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Robotics" by Samarth Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors improved performance on "ofﬂine robot learning environments such as MetaWorld and RoboSuite, and benchmark datasets such as D4RL." This indicates that these are key datasets to look for.

Next, I will check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly section 5, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they specifically mention using the **D4RL benchmark dataset** for various tasks, which is crucial for my extraction.

In section 5, the authors detail their experiments on the D4RL tasks, which include environments like "Maze environment," "Adroit domain," and "Kitchen environment." They also mention using **MetaWorld** and **RoboSuite** for dexterous manipulation tasks. I will note these datasets as they are integral to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **D4RL**: The citation is:
   > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

2. **MetaWorld**: The citation is:
   > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2019). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.10897.

3. **RoboSuite**: The citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Wong, J., Mandlekar, A., & Martín-Martín, R. (2020). *RoboSuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12293.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
