To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: The Progress from Basic Q-learning to Proximal Policy Optimization" by Mohamed-Amine Chadia and Hajar Mousannifa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing algorithms and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of reinforcement learning algorithms.

Next, I will focus on the **section that discusses the algorithms**. In this paper, the authors describe various reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning, DQN, REINFORCE, DDPG, TD3, and PPO. I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations of these algorithms.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited directly or if any papers are referenced that might contain datasets relevant to the algorithms discussed. This is crucial because the datasets may not be explicitly named in the main text but could be referenced in the citations.

As I analyze the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the authors refer to specific datasets for training or testing the algorithms, I will ensure to capture that information accurately.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources for the datasets if they are not provided in the current paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for anyone looking to replicate the experiments or further explore the field of reinforcement learning.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
