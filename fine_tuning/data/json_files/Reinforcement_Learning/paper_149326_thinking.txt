To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trust Region Policy Optimisation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jakub Grudzien Kuba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of proposed methods on benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will note any specific names mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their methods on two benchmarks: **StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** and **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**. I will look for any additional details about these datasets, such as their characteristics or specific configurations used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. **StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This dataset is used for evaluating multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in a competitive environment. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Mikayel Samvelyan et al. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04043, 2019.

2. **Multi-Agent MuJoCo**: This dataset is used for continuous control tasks in a simulated environment. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Christian Schroeder de Witt et al. *Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Continuous Cooperative Control*. CoRR, abs/2003.06709, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future use.
