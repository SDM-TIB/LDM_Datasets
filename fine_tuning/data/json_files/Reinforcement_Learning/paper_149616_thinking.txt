To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuZero with Self-competition for Rate Control in VP9 Video Compression" by Amol Mandhane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **YouTube UGC dataset** for evaluating video compression algorithms, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section 5.1, where they specify that they used **20,000 randomly selected 480p videos** for training and **3062 clips** from the **YouTube UGC dataset** for evaluation. This confirms the presence of specific datasets.

Now, I will gather the details about these datasets:

1. **YouTube UGC dataset**: This dataset is specifically mentioned as being created for evaluating video compression algorithms. It is noted that the dataset is available under the CC-BY 3.0 license, which is important for citation and usage rights.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **YouTube UGC dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
   > Wang, Y., Inguva, S., & Adsumilli, B. (2019). YouTube UGC dataset for video compression research. In 2019 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **YouTube UGC dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating video compression algorithms, consisting of 3062 clips resized to 480p.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the research paper along with their full citations.
