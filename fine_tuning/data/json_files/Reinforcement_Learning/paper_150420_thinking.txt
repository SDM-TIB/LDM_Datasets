To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wasserstein Actor-Critic: Directed Exploration via Optimism for Continuous-Actions Control" by Amarildo Likmeta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of the experiments. The authors may refer to standard benchmarks or specific datasets used for training and testing their proposed method.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MuJoCo** environments for evaluation, I would note that down. The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In IROS, 5026â€“5033. IEEE.

If the paper discusses specific tasks or environments like **RiverSwim** or **LQG**, I will also document these as datasets, along with their descriptions and any relevant citations if they are derived from other works.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured and can be used for further analysis or replication of the study.
