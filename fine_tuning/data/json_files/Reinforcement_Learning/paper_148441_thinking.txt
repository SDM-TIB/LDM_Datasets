To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Value Estimation for Single-Task Multi-Scene Reinforcement Learning" by Jaskirat Singh and Liang Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "ProcGen environments" and the "AI2-THOR framework," which suggests that these may be datasets or environments relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation on OpenAI Procgen Environments)**, where the authors describe their experimental design and the environments used for testing. Here, they mention several specific environments that are likely datasets:

1. **CoinRun**: This is a procedurally generated environment used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **CaveFlyer**: Another environment from the ProcGen suite, used for testing the proposed methods.
3. **Plunder**: Also part of the ProcGen environments, utilized in their experiments.
4. **BigFish**: Another environment mentioned in the context of their evaluations.
5. **Jumper**: Included in the list of environments for testing.
6. **Chaser**: Another environment used in their experiments.
7. **Climber**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation suite.
8. **Dodgeball**: Included in the experiments.
9. **FruitBot**: Another environment from the ProcGen suite.
10. **BossFight**: The last environment mentioned in their evaluation.

In **section 5 (Evaluation on the Visual Navigation Task)**, the authors refer to the **AI2-THOR environment**, which consists of 120 distinct scenes. This is another dataset that needs to be noted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ProcGen environments**, the citation is:
  > Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2019). *Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.01588.

- For **AI2-THOR**, the citation is:
  > Kolve, E., Mottaghi, R., Han, W., VanderBilt, E., Weihs, L., Herrasti, A., Gordon, D., Zhu, A., Gupta, A., & Farhadi, A. (2017). *AI2-THOR: An interactive 3D environment for visual AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05474.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
