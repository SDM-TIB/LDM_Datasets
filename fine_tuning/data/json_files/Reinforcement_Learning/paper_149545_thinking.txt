To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robustness of Neural Networks" by Steven Basart, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections, as they often provide a summary of the contributions and key datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions several new datasets, including ImageNet-A/O and ImageNet-R, which indicates that these are important for the study.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Natural Adversarial Examples" and "Neural Augmentations." These sections typically provide descriptions of the datasets, their purposes, and how they were constructed.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets. For example:
   - **ImageNet-A**: This dataset is described as containing adversarially filtered examples that are difficult for models to classify.
   - **ImageNet-O**: This dataset includes out-of-distribution examples that are meant to test the robustness of models.
   - **ImageNet-R**: This dataset consists of various artistic renditions of ImageNet object classes.
   - **StreetView StoreFronts (SVSF)**: This dataset focuses on images of storefronts with metadata for analyzing distribution shifts.
   - **DeepFashion Remixed (DFR)**: This dataset includes images of clothing items with various attributes for testing robustness.

4. **Consult the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution. For instance, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets, such as the original ImageNet paper or any other relevant publications.

5. **Document Full Citations**: I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For example:
   - For **ImageNet**: 
     > Russakovsky, Olga, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision* 88.2 (2010): 303-338.
   - For **ImageNet-A** and **ImageNet-O**, I will ensure to cite the paper that introduced these datasets as well.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will organize the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets mentioned in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
