To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Exploration of Visual Features and Their Weighted-Additive Fusion for Video Captioning" by Praveen S V et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention benchmarking their model on **two datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MSVD (Microsoft Video Description Dataset)**: This dataset contains 1,970 short video clips from YouTube, annotated with multi-lingual captions. The authors specify that they use only the English captions and separate the dataset into 1,200 training, 100 validation, and 670 test videos.

2. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset consists of 20,000 videos, amounting to 849 video hours, with over 100,000 total descriptions. The authors mention following the official train-validation splits, which assign 10,009 and 4,917 videos for training and validation, respectively.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > David Chen and William B Dolan. "Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation." In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2011, pp. 190–200.

- For **ActivityNet Captions**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. "Dense-captioning events in videos." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017, pp. 706–715.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
