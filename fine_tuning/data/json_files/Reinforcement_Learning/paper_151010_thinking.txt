To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Wildfire Mitigation in Simulated Disaster Environments" by Alexander Tapley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract introduces **SimFire** and **SimHarness**, which are tools for simulating wildfire scenarios and training reinforcement learning agents. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Preliminary Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using **real-world data from LANDFIRE** to simulate the fuels and terrain prior to fire ignition. This indicates that LANDFIRE is a dataset used in their research.

In **section A.3 (Validation and Verification)**, the authors reference the **BurnMD dataset**, which includes 308 medium-sized fires with near real-time mitigations and daily wildfire perimeters. This dataset is crucial for validating their fire spread simulator, SimFire.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For **LANDFIRE**, the citation is:
   > LANDFIRE. 13 Anderson Fire Behavior Fuel Models, Elevation, LANDFIRE 2.0.0, 2021. DOI: http://www.landfire/viewer.

2. For **BurnMD**, the citation is:
   > M. Dotter et al. “BurnMD: A Fire Projection and Mitigation Modeling Dataset”. In: International Conference of Learning Representations (2023).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper attribution, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.
