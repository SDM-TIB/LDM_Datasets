To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Navigation and Control: A Soft Actor-Critic with Hindsight Experience Replay Approach" by Myoung Hoon Lee and Jun Moon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **simulation setup** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their method to UAV navigation and control problems but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **simulation setup** section, where the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. Here, they mention two environments: **Environment I** (UAV without obstacles) and **Environment II** (UAV with obstacles). However, they do not specify any external datasets; instead, they describe the simulation parameters and the design of the environments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced. The authors provide simulation results based on their proposed method but again do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they focus on the performance of their algorithm in the defined environments.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets or external data sources, I will conclude that the authors created their own simulated environments for testing their algorithm rather than using established datasets.

Now, I will compile the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Environment I**: A simulated environment for UAV navigation without obstacles, designed to test the proposed algorithm.
2. **Environment II**: A simulated environment for UAV navigation with obstacles, also designed for testing.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors did not provide full citations for any datasets, as they utilized their own simulation environments.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

- **Environment I**: No external dataset; simulated environment for UAV navigation without obstacles.
- **Environment II**: No external dataset; simulated environment for UAV navigation with obstacles.

I will ensure to mention that no formal citations are available for datasets since the authors did not reference any external datasets in their work.
