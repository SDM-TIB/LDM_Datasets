To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Isolated Imaginations" by Minting Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on **CARLA** and **DeepMind Control Suite**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 4) to confirm the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on:

1. **CARLA**: A simulator for autonomous driving research, which provides complex and realistic visual observations. The authors mention using it for highway driving tasks.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: A set of continuous control tasks that serves as a standard benchmark for vision-based reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., LÃ³pez, A. M., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL (pp. 1-16).

- For **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., d. L. Casas, D., Budden, A., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CARLA** - A simulator for autonomous driving.
2. **DeepMind Control Suite** - A benchmark for continuous control tasks.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
