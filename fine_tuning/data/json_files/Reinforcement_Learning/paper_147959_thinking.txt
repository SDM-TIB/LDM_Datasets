To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Air Traffic Controller: A Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Marc Brittain and Peng Wei, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **section 3 (Problem Formulation)** and **section 5 (Numerical Experiments)**. In these sections, the authors may describe the simulations and environments used, which could include datasets or simulation environments that serve as datasets.

In the **Problem Formulation section**, the authors mention using the **BlueSky air traffic control simulator** as their environment. This simulator is crucial for their experiments, but I need to confirm if it is considered a dataset or if they reference any specific datasets derived from it.

In the **Numerical Experiments section**, they describe two case studies involving simulations with aircraft. While they do not explicitly mention datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets), the results from these simulations can be considered a form of dataset, as they provide performance metrics based on the simulations conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the BlueSky simulator or any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The references may include foundational papers or documentation that describe the simulator or any datasets used in conjunction with it.

The citation for the **BlueSky air traffic control simulator** is:
> Hoekstra, J. M. and Ellerbroek, J. "Bluesky ATC Simulator Project: An Open Data and Open Source Approach." In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Research in Air Transportation, pp. 1â€“8. FAA/Eurocontrol USA/Europe, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **BlueSky Air Traffic Control Simulator**: This is the primary environment used for the experiments, and while it may not be a dataset in the traditional sense, it provides the simulation data necessary for the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the full citation for the BlueSky simulator. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
