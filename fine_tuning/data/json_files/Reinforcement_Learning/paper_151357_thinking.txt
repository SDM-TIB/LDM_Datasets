To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Friendship Networks to Classroom Dynamics: Leveraging Neural Networks, Instrumental Variable and Genetic Algorithms for Optimal Educational Outcomes" by Lei Bill Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions using data from the **China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **data description section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the CEPS dataset. This section describes the dataset's structure, including the number of students surveyed, the types of data collected (e.g., academic performance, friendship networks), and the context in which the data was gathered. 

In this section, I find that the CEPS dataset includes information from **7,649 students across 179 classes**, with specific details about the students' 6th-grade academic performance and their friendship networks. This confirms that CEPS is indeed a significant dataset for the research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CEPS dataset. The citation is typically provided in a format that includes the authors, title, publication source, and year. In this case, the CEPS dataset is provided by the **National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China (NSRC)**, and the relevant links to the dataset are included in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The key dataset extracted is:

1. **China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS)**: This dataset is crucial for the study as it provides the empirical data needed to analyze peer effects and classroom dynamics.

The full citation for the CEPS dataset is:
> National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China. *China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS)*. Available at: http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/Enlish/dfiles/11184/14391213173188.pdf (English version) and http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/__local/C/67/E7/F7BA6FBDFBC3C8B808AA0F6E0FA_905BECDA_7A84E.pdf?e=.pdf (Chinese version).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is accurately documented and ready for any further processing or review.
