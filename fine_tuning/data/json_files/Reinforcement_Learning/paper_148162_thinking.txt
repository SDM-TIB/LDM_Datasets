To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards More Sample Efficiency in Reinforcement Learning with Data Augmentation" by Yijiong Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses two novel data augmentation techniques but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Preliminary Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a simulated 7-DOF Fetch Robotics arm trained with DDPG on various tasks, specifically the **pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place tasks**. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here, so I will need to check the references for any datasets that might have been used in these tasks.

In the **References section**, I will look for any papers that might describe datasets related to the tasks mentioned. The authors reference several works, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Instead, it focuses on the techniques and their application to robotic tasks. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of simulated environments and tasks, it does not provide specific datasets for these tasks.

Since no datasets are explicitly named in the paper, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Simulated 7-DOF Fetch Robotics Arm**: The experiments are conducted using a simulated environment, but no specific dataset is cited for the tasks of pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place.

2. **References**: The references include various works related to reinforcement learning and robotics, but they do not provide specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, and I will note the tasks used in the experiments without specific dataset references. This will be important for anyone looking to replicate the experiments or understand the data context.
