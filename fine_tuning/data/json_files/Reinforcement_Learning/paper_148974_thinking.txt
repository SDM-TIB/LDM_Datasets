To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Steering Angle Prediction for Vehicle Control Using Visual Odometry" by Qadeer Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using the **CARLA simulator** for experimental results, which suggests that this might be a dataset or a simulation environment used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of collecting labeled data for self-driving cars and refer to various publicly available datasets, indicating that they might be using or comparing against these datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the data collection process. The authors mention that data was collected using the CARLA simulator, which is a key dataset for their experiments. They describe how the simulator operates and the types of data it generates, including images and corresponding ground truth steering angles.

In the **experiments section**, I will confirm the use of the CARLA simulator and check if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The authors state that they trained their models on data collected from the CARLA simulator and tested them under various weather conditions, which reinforces the importance of this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset referenced is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: The citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

Additionally, the authors refer to other publicly available datasets in the context of driving applications. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets in the text. Therefore, I will focus on the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used in their research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
