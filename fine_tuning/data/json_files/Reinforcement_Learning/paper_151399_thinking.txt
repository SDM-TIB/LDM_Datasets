To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Redefining Safety for Autonomous Vehicles" by Philip Koopman and William Widen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing examples of AV safety problems** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it sets the stage for discussing safety in autonomous vehicles, which may lead to references to datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **examples of AV safety problems** section, as it discusses various incidents involving autonomous vehicles. I will look for any references to datasets that may have been used to analyze these incidents or to support the authors' arguments. 

As I read through the examples, I will note any specific datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to data collected from incidents involving robotaxis or statistics from safety reports, I will highlight these references.

I will also check the **References section** at the end of the paper to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to specific studies or reports that contain datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for those as well.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to robotaxi incidents, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If they cite a report or a paper that provides data on robotaxi safety incidents, I will extract the full citation for that report.

Once I have identified all datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research presented in the paper, making sure to maintain clarity and precision in the citations provided.
