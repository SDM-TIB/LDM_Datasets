To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerated Alternating Minimization, Accelerated Sinkhorn’s Algorithm and Accelerated Iterative Bregman Projections" by Sergey Guminov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work. If they mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will take note of them.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the experiments, including the datasets involved.

The **experiments section** is crucial, as it typically outlines the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their sizes and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Last.fm dataset** for collaborative filtering, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yifan Hu, Yehuda Koren, and Chris Volinsky. *Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets*. In Proceedings of the 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM ’08, pages 263–272, 2008.

Similarly, if they mention the **MNIST dataset** for experiments related to optimal transport, I will find its citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 2010.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
