To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Equivalence between Loss Functions and Non-Uniform Sampling in Experience Replay" by Scott Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods in several MuJoCo and Atari environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be included.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluations on various MuJoCo environments and a set of Atari games. I will note down the names of these environments as they often serve as datasets for reinforcement learning tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following environments:

1. **MuJoCo environments**: These are physics-based environments used for continuous control tasks. The paper does not specify individual datasets but refers to the suite of MuJoCo environments as a whole.

2. **Atari games**: The authors mention evaluating their methods on a set of Atari games, specifically using the OpenAI Gym interface. Again, individual games are not listed, but the Atari suite is a well-known collection of environments used in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

- For **Atari**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. 

1. **MuJoCo environments**:
   - Citation: Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

2. **Atari games**:
   - Citation: Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
