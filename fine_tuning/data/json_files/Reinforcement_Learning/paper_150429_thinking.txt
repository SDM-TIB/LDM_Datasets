To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RACCER: Towards Reachable and Certain Counterfactual Explanations for Reinforcement Learning" by Jasmina Gajcin and Ivana Dusparic, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the evaluation tasks and the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their approach in two environments: **Stochastic GridWorld** and **Frozen Lake**. I will look for any specific details about these environments that indicate they are datasets or benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the environments in detail. They explain the rules and objectives of both Stochastic GridWorld and Frozen Lake, which suggests that these environments serve as datasets for testing their algorithm. However, I need to confirm if they are referenced as datasets in the context of the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to these environments. If the authors have cited foundational papers or sources that describe these environments, I will include those citations as they are essential for proper attribution.

For **Stochastic GridWorld**, I will look for a citation that describes the environment, which is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning research. Similarly, I will do the same for **Frozen Lake**.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets and their citations. The citations will be formatted according to the conventions used in the paper, ensuring that I provide complete and accurate references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
