To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overview of the TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track" by Nick Craswell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses large training datasets for document and passage retrieval tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Task Description** section, particularly the subsections for **Document Retrieval Task** and **Passage Retrieval Task**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided.

In the **Datasets** section, the authors mention two main datasets:
1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is highlighted as a human-labeled training set for ad hoc ranking in information retrieval, which is crucial for the tasks discussed.
2. **ORCAS Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from the logs of a major search engine and is used for analyzing search performance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations I will extract are:
- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder, Andrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen, et al. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

- For **ORCAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Daniel Campos, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Bodo Billerbeck. *ORCAS: 18 Million Clicked Query-Document Pairs for Analyzing Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.05324, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
