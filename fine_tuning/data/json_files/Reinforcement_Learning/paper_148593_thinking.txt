To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Munchausen Reinforcement Learning" by Nino Vieillard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (likely section 4 in this paper) in detail, as this section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, as they often provide detailed descriptions, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will note down any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors mention using the "Atari Learning Environment" or any specific game datasets, I will record these details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact title as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will ensure that it is organized clearly, making it easy to understand and reference. This will involve creating a structured list of datasets with their corresponding descriptions and citations.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
