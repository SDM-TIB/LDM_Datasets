To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Genetic Algorithm with Tree-structured Mutation for Hyperparameter Optimisation of Graph Neural Networks" by Yingfang Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section IV)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on three molecular property prediction datasets: **ESOL**, **FreeSolv**, and **Lipophilicity**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets within the same section. The authors describe these datasets as being part of **MoleculeNet**, which is a benchmark for molecular machine learning. They also mention that the datasets are publicly available, which is useful information for citation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the MoleculeNet paper, which provides the necessary citation for the datasets used in their experiments.

The citation for the MoleculeNet datasets is:
> Z. Wu, B. Ramsundar, E. N. Feinberg, J. Gomes, C. Geniesse, A. S. Pappu, K. Leswing, and V. Pande. *Moleculenet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 513â€“530, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **ESOL Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting molecular properties, part of the MoleculeNet benchmark.
2. **FreeSolv Dataset**: Another dataset for molecular property prediction, also part of MoleculeNet.
3. **Lipophilicity Dataset**: The third dataset used for molecular property prediction, included in the MoleculeNet benchmark.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited with the full citation provided above. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
