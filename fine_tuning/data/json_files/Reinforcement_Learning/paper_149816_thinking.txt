To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Leveraging Dependency Grammar for Fine-Grained Offensive Language Detection using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Divyam Goel and Raksha Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Offensive Language Identification Dataset**: This dataset was presented for a shared task on offensive language detection in the SemEval Challenge 2019. It consists of 14,000 English tweets annotated for three subtasks: whether a tweet is offensive, whether the offensive tweet is targeted, and the type of target (individual, group, or other).

2. **Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset**: This dataset was curated by Davidson et al. (2017) and contains tweets annotated into three classes: hate speech, offensive language, and none. It includes a total of 25,000 tweets extracted using a hate speech lexicon.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Offensive Language Identification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09666, 2019.

- For the **Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomas Davidson, Dana Warmsley, Michael Macy, and Ingmar Weber. *Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04009, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
