To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Learning versus Proximal Policy Optimization: Performance Comparison in a Material Sorting Task" by Reuf Kozlica et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the comparison of two reinforcement learning algorithms in a simulated production system, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe a **Petri Net (PN)-based simulation environment**. I will look for any specific datasets or simulation environments that are referenced in relation to this PN model.

In the **use case and simulation environment** section, the authors mention that they used a simulation environment based on previous work by Riedmann et al. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with that prior research. I will need to check the references to identify any datasets used in those studies.

I will also look at the **evaluation** section to see if the authors mention any datasets used for training or testing the algorithms. If they refer to any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them clearly, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile all the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing full citations for each dataset.
