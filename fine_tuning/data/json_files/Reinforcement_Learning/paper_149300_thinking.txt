To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapped Meta-Learning" by Sebastian Flennerhag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses achieving state-of-the-art results on the **Atari ALE benchmark**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **Atari Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known dataset for reinforcement learning tasks. I will look for specific details about how the dataset is used, including any variations or specific configurations.

In the **multi-task few-shot learning section** (Section 6), the authors refer to the **MiniImagenet** dataset, which is commonly used for few-shot learning tasks. I will extract details about how this dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Atari ALE**: The citation for the Atari dataset is:
   > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. **MiniImagenet**: The citation for the MiniImagenet dataset is:
   > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as extracted from the references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
