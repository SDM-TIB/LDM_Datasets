To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Strategy-Oriented Bayesian Soft Actor-Critic Model" by Qin Yang and Ramviyas Parasuraman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on standard continuous control benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and evaluation sections**. In the evaluation section, the authors explicitly state that they compare their method against the standard continuous control benchmarks: **Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Humanoid-v2**. This indicates that these environments are likely associated with datasets used for training and testing.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge in the field:

1. **Hopper-v2**: This dataset is part of the MuJoCo physics engine and is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature. The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (pp. 5026â€“5033). IEEE.

2. **Walker2d-v2**: Similar to Hopper-v2, this dataset is also part of the MuJoCo environments. The same citation applies.

3. **Humanoid-v2**: This dataset is again part of the MuJoCo physics engine. The same citation applies.

Since all three datasets are part of the same suite (MuJoCo), I will use the same citation for each of them.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that includes the datasets and their corresponding citations, ready for further processing or review.
