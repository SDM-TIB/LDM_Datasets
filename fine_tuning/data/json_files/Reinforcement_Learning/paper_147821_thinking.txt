To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Managing App Install Ad Campaigns in RTB: A Q-Learning Approach" by Anit Kumar Sahu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments based on data from app install campaigns managed by Yahooâ€™s Gemini advertising platform, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors refer to "data from mobile app install campaigns managed by Yahoo Gemini" in the results section, indicating that this is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites Yahoo Gemini as the source of the data, but it does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I can still document it as follows:

1. **Yahoo Gemini Dataset**: This dataset consists of impression-level data from mobile app install campaigns managed by Yahoo Gemini, covering various publishers and campaigns over a specified time period.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is derived from Yahoo's advertising platform, which is referenced in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the citation format as best as possible given the context.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary information from the paper.
