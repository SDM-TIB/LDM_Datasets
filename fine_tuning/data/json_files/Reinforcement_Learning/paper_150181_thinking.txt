To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wind Power Forecasting Considering Data Privacy Protection: A Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Yang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real-world historical data for simulations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Case Study)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they use real-world datasets consisting of **11 wind farms with a sampling interval of 5 minutes in Washington State, USA**, obtained from the **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)**. This indicates that the dataset is related to wind power forecasting and is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as the source of their data. I will look for the specific report or dataset title from NREL that corresponds to the wind farm data used in their study.

The citation for the dataset is likely to be:
> National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *Wind Power Data*. Available: https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-power-data.html (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
