To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations for Tabular Data" by Klaus Broelemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using two real-world datasets: the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset and the "Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)" dataset. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they utilized these datasets for their experiments. They provide insights into the nature of the data and the tasks performed, which helps in understanding the datasets' relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset, I will note that it is available on Kaggle, and I will include the citation as follows:
> McGrath, R., Costabello, L., Le Van, C., Sweeney, P., Kamiab, F., Shen, Z., & Lecue, F. (2018). Interpretable Credit Application Predictions With Counterfactual Explanations. NeurIPS workshop: Challenges and Opportunities for AI in Financial Services: the Impact of Fairness, Explainability, Accuracy, and Privacy.

For the "Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)" dataset, I will mention that it can be obtained from the FICO community, and I will include the citation:
> FICO. (n.d.). Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dataset. Retrieved from https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
