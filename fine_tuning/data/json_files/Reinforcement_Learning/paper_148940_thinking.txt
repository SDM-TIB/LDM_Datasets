To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Surprising Effectiveness of PPO in Cooperative Multi-Agent Games" by Chao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of PPO on four popular multi-agent testbeds, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Main Results)**, where the authors describe the testbeds used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle World Environments (MPE)**: This dataset consists of various cooperative tasks in a 2D world where agents navigate and interact with each other. The specific tasks mentioned are Spread, Reference, and Comm.

2. **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This dataset involves decentralized agents cooperating to defeat adversarial bots in various scenarios. The paper references multiple maps within this challenge.

3. **Google Research Football (GRF)**: This dataset includes cooperative multi-agent challenges where agents play football against scripted opponents.

4. **Hanabi Challenge**: A turn-based card game where agents must cooperate to stack cards in ascending order.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Multi-Agent Particle World Environments (MPE)**, the citation is:

- For **Google Research Football (GRF)**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
