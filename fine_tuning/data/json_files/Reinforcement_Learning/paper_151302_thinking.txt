To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HRLAIF: Improvements in Helpfulness and Harmlessness in Open-domain Reinforcement Learning From AI Feedback" by Ang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their research objectives or methodology.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. The authors may provide insights into how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **BeaverTails Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of hybrid harmlessness labeling. It is used to sample harmful prompts for the training process. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ji, J., Liu, M., Dai, J., Pan, X., Zhang, C., Bian, C., Sun, R., Wang, Y., & Yang, Y. (2023). *Beavertails: Towards improved safety alignment of LLM via a human-preference dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.04657.

2. **C-Eval Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the helpfulness of the model. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Huang, Y., Bai, Y., Zhu, Z., Zhang, J., Zhang, J., Su, T., Liu, J., Lv, C., Zhang, Y., Lei, J., Fu, Y., Sun, M., & He, J. (2023). *C-eval: A multi-level multi-discipline Chinese evaluation suite for foundation models*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

3. **MMLU Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for measuring massive multitask language understanding. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

4. **ToxiGen Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the harmlessness of the model. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hartvigsen, T., Gabriel, S., Palangi, H., Sap, M., Ray, D., & Kamar, E. (2022). *Toxigen: A large-scale machine-generated dataset for adversarial and implicit hate speech detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.09509.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
