To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning compositional structures for semantic graph parsing" by Jonas Groschwitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of AM dependency parsing and mentions that the method is evaluated across several graphbanks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experiments** section, the authors refer to evaluations on four graphbanks: **DM**, **PAS**, **PSD**, and **AMR**. This indicates that these graphbanks are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the graphbanks are as follows:

1. **DM (Deep Meaning)**:
   > Lindemann, M., Groschwitz, J., & Koller, A. (2019). Compositional semantic parsing across graphbanks. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 4576–4585). Florence, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **PAS (Penn Abstract Syntax)**:

3. **PSD (Prague Semantic Dependency)**:

4. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
