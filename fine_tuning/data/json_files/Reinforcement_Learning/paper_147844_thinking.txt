To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Monte Carlo Tree Search as a Demonstrator within Asynchronous Deep RL" by Bilal Kartal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their methods to a two-player mini version of the Pommerman game, which suggests that there may be a dataset or environment related to this game.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the Pommerman environment in detail. They mention that the experiments use a simulator based on the classic console game Bomberman, which is a significant clue that the dataset or environment is the Pommerman game itself.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a description of the Pommerman environment, detailing the actions available to agents, the structure of the game, and the challenges faced. This indicates that the Pommerman game serves as the dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Pommerman environment. The authors reference the Pommerman environment as follows:

- For the Pommerman environment, the citation is:
  > Resnick, C., Eldridge, W., Ha, D., Britz, D., Foerster, J., Togelius, J., Cho, K., & Bruna, J. (2018). *Pommerman: A multi-agent playground*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.07124.

Since the Pommerman environment is the primary dataset used in their experiments, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
