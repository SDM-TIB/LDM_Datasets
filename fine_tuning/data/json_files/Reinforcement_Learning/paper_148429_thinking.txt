To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proxy Experience Replay: Federated Distillation for Distributed Reinforcement Learning" by Han Cha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for distributed reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **environmental settings section** where the authors describe the experiments conducted. They mention using the **Cartpole environment** from the OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. This indicates that the Cartpole dataset is relevant to their experiments.

In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors compare their proposed methods against baseline algorithms, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they rely on existing environments like Cartpole. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, which includes the Cartpole environment. The citation is as follows:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

Since the paper primarily utilizes the Cartpole environment from OpenAI Gym, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Cartpole environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
