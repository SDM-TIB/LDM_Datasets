To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Digital Cousins for Ensemble Q-Learning in Large-Scale Wireless Networks" by Talha Bozkus and Urbashi Mitra, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation of their methods. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any mentions of datasets related to wireless networks or reinforcement learning, as these are the primary focus of the research. If the authors refer to any established datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "MISO network with interference channels," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, if they refer to a dataset from previous works, I will ensure to cite those original papers.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of the datasets used in this research.
