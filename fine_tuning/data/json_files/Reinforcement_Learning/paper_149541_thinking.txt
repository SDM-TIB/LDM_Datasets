To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Task Specifications with Action-Constraints" by Arun Raman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may contain examples or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and provide an illustrative example in Section IV. I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used for simulations or experiments, particularly in the context of the grid world example described.

In the **illustrative example**, the authors discuss a grid world scenario involving an agent that picks up and delivers items. While they describe the environment and constraints, they do not explicitly mention a dataset. Instead, they focus on the simulation setup and the parameters used for training the reinforcement learning model.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the context of the research. However, the references primarily consist of foundational texts and previous works in reinforcement learning and supervisory control theory, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no explicit datasets provided or referenced in this research. Therefore, I will document this finding, noting that while the paper discusses a simulation environment and constraints, it does not utilize any publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is important to reference the source of the information I have analyzed.

The citation for the paper is:

In summary, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will provide the citation for the paper itself as the primary reference.
