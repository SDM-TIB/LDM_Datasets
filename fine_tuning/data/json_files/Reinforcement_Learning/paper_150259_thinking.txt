To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Policy Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Md Masudur Rahman and Yexiang Xue, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on various continuous control tasks from four reinforcement learning benchmarks: **DeepMind Control, OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, and Nvidia IsaacGym**. 

I will look for specific datasets or environments within these benchmarks. For instance, the authors refer to specific tasks such as "Hopper," "BipedalWalker," and "CartPole" from OpenAI Gym, and "Ant" and "Minitaur" from PyBullet. Each of these tasks represents a dataset in the context of reinforcement learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

Here are the citations I will include for the datasets:

1. **DeepMind Control**:

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

3. **PyBullet**:
   > Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2016â€“2021). Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning. http://pybullet.org.

4. **Nvidia IsaacGym**:
   > Makoviychuk, V., Wawrzyniak, L., Guo, Y., Lu, M., Storey, K., Macklin, M., Hoeller, D., Rudin, N., Allshire, A., Handa, A., & State, G. (2021). Isaac gym: High performance gpu-based physics simulation for robot learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.10470*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
