To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic MPC with Multi-modal Predictions for Traffic Intersections" by Siddharth H. Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithm using a subset of the **Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look for more detailed information in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of autonomous driving at intersections and mention the use of multi-modal predictions, which suggests that they rely on specific datasets for their simulations.

In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly state that they use a subset of the **Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset** for their simulations. They describe how this dataset is utilized to train their multi-modal predictions. This confirms that the **Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset** is a key dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

> J. Houston, G. Zuidhof, L. Bergamini, Y. Ye, A. Jain, S. Omari, V. Iglovikov, and P. Ondruska. *One thousand and one hours: Self-driving motion prediction dataset*. 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Lyft Level 5 prediction dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset used for training multi-modal predictions in autonomous driving scenarios, specifically for predicting the behavior of surrounding vehicles at traffic intersections.
   - **Full Citation**: J. Houston, G. Zuidhof, L. Bergamini, Y. Ye, A. Jain, S. Omari, V. Iglovikov, and P. Ondruska. *One thousand and one hours: Self-driving motion prediction dataset*. 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
