To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end grasping policies for human-in-the-loop robots via deep reinforcement learning" by Mohammadreza Sharif et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a method for training a policy based on real reaching trajectories, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **DEXTRON instantiation**. Here, the authors describe how they collected real human hand trajectory data. They mention that they recorded trajectory data from 9 male subjects, resulting in a total of 576 individual trajectories. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from these trajectories.

In the **Data Collection and Processing subsection**, the authors provide details about the experimental setup and the data collection process. They mention using a top-mount Primesense Carmine RGB-D camera and an HTC Vive Tracker to capture the hand trajectories. This section confirms the existence of a dataset, specifically the one containing the recorded trajectories.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes important time instances during the reaching actions, which were manually annotated. This further emphasizes the dataset's significance in their research.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific reference for the dataset itself, but they do mention that the data collection was conducted as part of their research. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the dataset of real human hand trajectories, the citation is:
  > Mohammadreza Sharif, Deniz Erdogmus, Christopher Amato, and Taskin Padir. *End-to-end grasping policies for human-in-the-loop robots via deep reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Real Human Hand Trajectories
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 576 individual trajectories recorded from 9 male subjects using an RGB-D camera and an HTC Vive Tracker. The trajectories were annotated for key time instances during reaching actions.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
