To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Uncertainty-based Bias Mitigation in Ranking" by Maria Heuss et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experimental setup**. In this paper, the relevant section is **4.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval collection** and the **MS MARCOFair** subset, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In section 4.3, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
- **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval collection**: This dataset is used for training the retrieval models.
- **MS MARCOFair**: This is a subset of the MS MARCO dataset, consisting of 215 non-gendered queries used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval collection**, the citation is:
> Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Computation: Integrating Neural and Symbolic Approaches 2016.

For the **MS MARCOFair** subset, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the original MS MARCO dataset, as it is a specific subset created for the purpose of this research.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
