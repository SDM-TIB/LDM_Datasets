To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Step Towards Efficient Evaluation of Complex Perception Tasks in Simulation" by Jonathan Sadeghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Carla simulator**, which suggests that there may be datasets generated or utilized within this context.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors describe their methodology and the tasks they evaluated. Here, they mention using the Carla simulator for two driving tasks: **adaptive cruise control (ACC)** and the **Carla leaderboard**. I will look for any specific datasets or scenario descriptions that indicate the data used for training and testing.

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **ACC task** and mention that the dataset consists of driving scenarios approximately 10 minutes long, featuring various vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians in urban and highway scenes. They specify that scenarios 0-9 are used for training and scenario 10 for testing, but they do not provide a formal dataset name.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **Carla leaderboard** evaluation, indicating that scenarios 0-58 are used for training and scenarios 59-62 for testing. Again, they do not provide a formal dataset name, but they reference the Carla simulator, which is a well-known dataset in the autonomous driving community.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the Carla simulator or datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For the **Carla simulator**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

This citation provides the necessary reference for the dataset generated by the Carla simulator.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Carla Simulator Dataset**: This dataset consists of driving scenarios generated by the Carla simulator, which includes various vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians in urban and highway environments. The specific scenarios used for training and testing are:
   - Training: Scenarios 0-9 for the ACC task; Scenarios 0-58 for the Carla leaderboard.
   - Testing: Scenario 10 for the ACC task; Scenarios 59-62 for the Carla leaderboard.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

- **Carla Simulator Dataset**:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
