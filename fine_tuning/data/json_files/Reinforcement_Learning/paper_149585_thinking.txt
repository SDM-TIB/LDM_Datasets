To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PICKNET: REAL-TIME CHANNEL SELECTION FOR AD HOC MICROPHONE ARRAYS" by Takuya Yoshioka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations using real conversational recordings obtained with various smartphones, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention collecting **12 recordings of real conversations** for evaluation, which is a clear indication of a dataset. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the context in which it was collected (e.g., conversations held in various places with different phone models).

In Section 4.2, the authors provide more specifics about the dataset, including the number of recordings, the nature of the conversations (two-speaker, three-speaker, and four-speaker), and the environments in which the recordings took place. This information is crucial for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors do not provide a formal citation for the conversational recordings dataset since it appears to be original data collected for the study. However, they reference other datasets used for training data, such as **WSJ1** and **LibriSpeech**.

The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **WSJ1**, the citation is:
  > P. Godfrey, D. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. *SWITCHBOARD: Telephone Speech Corpus for Research and Development*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1992.

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

Since the conversational recordings dataset is original and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for WSJ1 and LibriSpeech, while also noting the original dataset created for the study. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
