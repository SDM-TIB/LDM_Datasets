To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning" by Cyprien de Masson dâ€™Autume et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on text classification and question answering, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Text Classification Datasets**: The authors refer to a collection of datasets from Zhang et al. (2015), which includes:
   - **AGNews**: A dataset for news classification with 4 classes.
   - **Yelp**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes.
   - **DBPedia**: A Wikipedia article classification dataset with 14 classes.
   - **Amazon**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes.
   - **Yahoo**: A dataset for questions and answers categorization with 10 classes.

   They also mention that they merged the classes for the Yelp and Amazon datasets due to similar semantics, resulting in a total of 33 classes across the datasets.

2. **Question Answering Datasets**: The authors list three datasets:
   - **SQuAD 1.1**: A reading comprehension dataset constructed from Wikipedia articles, containing almost 90,000 training examples and 10,000 validation examples.
   - **TriviaQA**: A dataset with question-answer pairs written by trivia enthusiasts, which includes two sections (Web and Wikipedia) treated as separate datasets.
   - **QuAC**: An information-seeking dialog-style dataset with 80,000 training examples and approximately 7,000 validation examples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Proceedings of the NIPS.

- For **SQuAD 1.1**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

- For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:
  > Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension. In Proceedings of ACL.

- For **QuAC**, the citation is:
  > Choi, E., He, H., Iyyer, M., Yatskar, M., tau Yih, W., Choi, Y., Liang, P., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2018). QuAC: Question answering in context. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
