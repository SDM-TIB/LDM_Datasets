To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration Based Language Learning for Text-Based Games" by Andrea Madotto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss their methodology and mention the use of text-based games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be included.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly mention two environments: **CoinCollector** and **CookingWorld**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

1. **CoinCollector**: This dataset consists of a class of text-based games where the objective is to find and collect a coin from a specific location in a set of connected rooms. The authors mention that the agent wins the game after collecting the coin, receiving a reward of +1. This dataset is used to benchmark the exploration capabilities of their proposed method.

2. **CookingWorld**: This dataset includes 4,440 games with varying levels of difficulty, where the goal is to cook and eat food based on given recipes. The authors provide details about the complexity of the games, the number of ingredients, and the types of actions required. This dataset is used to evaluate the generalization ability of their proposed methodology.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original works related to these datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution.

- For **CoinCollector**, the citation is:
  > Yuan, X., Cˆot´e, M.-A., Sordoni, A., Laroche, R., Tachet des Combes, R., Hausknecht, M., & Trischler, A. (2018). Counting to explore and generalize in text-based games. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.11525*.

- For **CookingWorld**, the citation is:
  > Cˆot´e, M.-A. (2018). First textworld problems: A reinforcement and language learning challenge. In *NeurIPS Workshop*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
