To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resolving Implicit Coordination in Multi-Agent Deep RL with Deep Q-Networks & Game Theory" by Griffin Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed methods on **three custom environments**. This indicates that there are datasets or environments that need to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They specifically mention three custom environments:

1. **Predator Prey Environment**: A multi-player game where predators chase prey on a 2-D grid. The dataset consists of the state representations and actions taken by the agents during gameplay.

2. **Warehouse Environment**: A simulated warehouse scenario where agents must deliver boxes to a central location. The dataset includes the state representations of the agents and the actions taken to complete the tasks.

3. **Synchronization Environment**: A toy synchronization game where two agents must reach opposite corners of a grid simultaneously. The dataset here consists of the state representations and actions taken by the agents to achieve synchronization.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these environments, confirming that they are indeed the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these environments. However, since these are custom environments created by the authors, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the environments are based on the OpenAI Gym framework, which is referenced in the paper.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as it is the basis for the custom environments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Predator Prey Environment**: Custom dataset based on a multi-player game of tag.
2. **Warehouse Environment**: Custom dataset based on a simulated warehouse scenario.
3. **Synchronization Environment**: Custom dataset based on a synchronization game.

The full citation for the OpenAI Gym, which is relevant to these datasets, is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or review.
