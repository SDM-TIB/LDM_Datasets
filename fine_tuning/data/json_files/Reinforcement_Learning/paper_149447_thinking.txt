To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Cooperate with Unseen Agents via Meta-Reinforcement Learning" by Rujikorn Charakorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper for specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the ad hoc teamwork problem and mention the use of cooperative environments, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe the cooperative environments used for experiments.

In **section 4 (Cooperative Environments)**, the authors detail two specific environments used for their experiments:

1. **Lever Coordination Game (LC Game)**: This environment is designed to test cooperative skills by having two agents select from five levers. The dataset here consists of the behaviors of pre-programmed agents that repeat a fixed pattern of actions.

2. **Discrete Speaker-Listener Game (DSL Game)**: This game involves a speaker and a listener interacting with landmarks. The dataset includes the mappings of messages to landmarks for the pre-programmed agents.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the datasets described are based on the authors' own experimental setups rather than publicly available datasets, I will note that the environments are adaptations of existing games rather than traditional datasets.

The relevant citations for the foundational works that describe these environments are:

- For the **Lever Coordination Game**, the reference is:
  > Hu, H., Lerer, A., Peysakhovich, A., and Foerster, J. "Other-Play" for zero-shot coordination. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.02979, 2020.

- For the **Discrete Speaker-Listener Game**, the reference is:
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y. I., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, O. P., and Mordatch, I. Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 6379â€“6390, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
