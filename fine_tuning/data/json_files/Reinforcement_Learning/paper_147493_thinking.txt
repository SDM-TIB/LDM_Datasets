To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilising Experience Replay for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jakob Foerster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on a "decentralised variant of StarCraft unit micromanagement," which suggests that the StarCraft environment is used as a dataset for experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more details about the dataset. In section 5.1, the authors describe the "Decentralised StarCraft Micromanagement" task, indicating that the experiments are conducted in the StarCraft environment. They mention that the agents control Terran Marines and that the dynamics of the environment are complex and stochastic, which implies that the data generated during these experiments serves as the dataset.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets or benchmarks in the **related work section** or **acknowledgements**. However, it appears that the primary dataset used for evaluation is the StarCraft environment itself, as no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the StarCraft dataset based on the context provided in the paper. The relevant citation for the StarCraft environment is:

> Blizzard Entertainment. *StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War*. [Video Game]. Blizzard Entertainment, 1998.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset for this research is the StarCraft environment.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for the identified dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper referencing.
