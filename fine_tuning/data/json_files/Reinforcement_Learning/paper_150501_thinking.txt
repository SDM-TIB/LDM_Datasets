To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning with biased policy rules" by Olivier Compte, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used for analysis or experimentation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology**, **experiments**, or **results**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss empirical results or simulations, as these often involve datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific conditions under which the data was collected.

If the paper references other works or datasets, I will ensure to check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Prisoner's Dilemma Dataset" or any other specific dataset, I will look for the following information:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. The full citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will review the gathered information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
