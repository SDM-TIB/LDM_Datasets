To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Economic span selection of bridge based on deep reinforcement learning" by Leye Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a deep Q-network algorithm for selecting the economic span of a bridge, but it does not mention any specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction primarily discusses the theoretical background and the significance of the study without mentioning specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the bridge simulation environment and the data used for training the deep reinforcement learning model. The paper mentions that the environment is a two-dimensional grid representing different materials and spans, but it does not specify any external datasets used for training or validation.

In the **results section**, I will check if there are any datasets used for testing the model's performance. However, the results primarily focus on the agent's ability to learn and select the economic span based on the simulation environment created by the authors, without referencing any external datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any specific datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. 

Finally, I will ensure that I have thoroughly checked the **references section** for any potential datasets that might have been cited indirectly. However, the references primarily consist of literature related to reinforcement learning and bridge engineering, rather than specific datasets.

In summary, after reviewing the entire paper, I will note that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or cited in this research paper. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries or citations as there are none to report.
