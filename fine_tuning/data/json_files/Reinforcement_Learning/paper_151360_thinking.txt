To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning with Weight Interpolation" by JÄ™drzej Kozal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they utilize **Cifar10**, **Cifar100**, and **Tiny ImageNet** datasets, which are standard benchmarks in continual learning. This section will provide details about how these datasets are split into tasks.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **Cifar10** and **Cifar100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jiayu Wu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
