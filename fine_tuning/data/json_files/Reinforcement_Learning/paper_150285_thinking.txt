To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Generic Value-Selection Heuristic Inside a Constraint Programming Solver" by Tom Marty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three combinatorial optimization problems: **graph coloring, maximum independent set, and maximum cut**. However, they do not specify any external datasets but rather indicate that they used randomly generated instances based on the **Barabási-Albert graph** model. This is a crucial point, as it implies that the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather synthetic instances generated for the purpose of the study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the Barabási-Albert model or any other relevant datasets that might have been used in previous works. However, since the paper primarily focuses on the methodology and results derived from generated instances, there may not be formal citations for datasets in the traditional sense.

After gathering this information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the Barabási-Albert model or any other referenced works that provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section for details on the datasets used.
3. Check the references for any relevant citations related to the datasets or models.
4. Document the findings, ensuring to include full citations where applicable.

Since the paper primarily uses generated instances rather than established datasets, I will note this in the final documentation.
