To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal feature rescaling in machine learning based on neural networks" by Federico Maria Vitrò et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the training of Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and hints at the use of datasets for modeling outcomes, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Case Study)**, where the authors describe the application of their method to a real industrial scenario involving centerless grinding. Here, they mention the generation of a dataset for the regression problem, defined as \( D := \{y_i, x_i\} \), where \( y_i \) is the continuous value of roundness and \( x_i \) is the vector of process parameters. This indicates that a dataset has been created for their experiments.

In **subsection A (Dataset generation)**, the authors specify that the dataset consists of 4069 samples, with 12 parameters defining each operation. They also mention that the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets using a hold-out procedure. This section provides crucial details about the dataset structure and its purpose.

To ensure I have the full citation for the dataset, I will look for any references that describe the high-fidelity model used to generate the dataset. The authors reference a comprehensive description of this model in [15], which is:
> Cui, Q., Ding, H., and Cheng, K. (2021). An analytical investigation on the workpiece roundness generation and its perfection strategies in centreless grinding. *Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture*, 229(3), 409–420.

Additionally, they reference a low-fidelity model in [16]:
> Bianchi, G., Leonesio, M., and Safarzadeh, H. (2020). A double input describing function approach for stability analysis in centerless grinding under interrupted cut. *International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology*, 108(1–2), 439–453.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Centerless Grinding Dataset
   - **Description**: A virtual dataset generated for the regression problem involving roundness prediction in centerless grinding, consisting of 4069 samples with 12 parameters defining each operation.
   - **Full Citation**: 
     - High-fidelity model: Cui, Q., Ding, H., and Cheng, K. (2021). An analytical investigation on the workpiece roundness generation and its perfection strategies in centreless grinding. *Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture*, 229(3), 409–420.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
