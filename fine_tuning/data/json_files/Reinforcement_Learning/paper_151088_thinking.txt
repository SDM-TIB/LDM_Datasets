To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DriveLM: Driving with Graph Visual Question Answering" by Chonghao Sima et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset called **DriveLM-Data**, which is built upon existing datasets like **nuScenes** and **CARLA**. This suggests that I should look for more details about these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors mention the instantiation of datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon **nuScenes** and **CARLA**. This confirms that these datasets are relevant to the research and should be included in my extraction.

In the **Datasets** section, the authors provide specific details about the two datasets:

1. **DriveLM-nuScenes**: This dataset consists of annotated question-answer pairs arranged in a graph structure, linking images with driving behavior through logical reasoning. It includes a total of 34,149 frames and is designed to cover various aspects of autonomous driving, including perception, prediction, and planning.

2. **DriveLM-CARLA**: This dataset is generated using the CARLA simulator and contains 3.7 million question-answer pairs. It is noted for its scalability and the variety of sensor outputs it supports, making it a comprehensive resource for training models in autonomous driving scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yuxin Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.
