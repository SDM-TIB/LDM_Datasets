To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Solve Routing Problems via Distributionally Robust Optimization" by Yuan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on two benchmark datasets: **TSPLib** and **CVRPLib**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention the use of **TSPLib** and **CVRPLib** in the **experiments and analysis** section. They describe how these datasets are utilized to evaluate the performance of their proposed methods.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **TSPLib**: This is a well-known library of instances for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The authors mention that they trained their models on 150,000 instances, including 100,000 instances from a uniform distribution and 50,000 instances from other distributions.

2. **CVRPLib**: This library contains instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Similar to TSPLib, the authors used a mix of instances from various distributions for training their models.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TSPLib**, the citation is:
  > Reinelt, G. (1991). TSPLIB—A traveling salesman problem library. *ORSA Journal on Computing*, 3(4), 376–384.

- For **CVRPLib**, the citation is:
  > Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., & Subramanian, A. (2017). New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 257(3), 845–858.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
