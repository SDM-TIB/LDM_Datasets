To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Batch-level Experience Replay with Review for Continual Learning" by Zheda Mai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the CVPR 2020 CLVision Continual Learning challenge using the **CORe50 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Challenge Framework)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **CORe50 dataset**. They explain that it consists of 50 domestic objects across 10 categories, acquired in 11 distinct sessions, totaling 164,866 RGB-D images. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details for further citation.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CORe50 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni. *Core50: A New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition*. In CoRL, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **CORe50 dataset** in the context of the challenge, I will ensure that I capture all relevant details about this dataset, including its purpose, structure, and any specific characteristics mentioned by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **CORe50 dataset** using the information gathered, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.

After completing this process, I will have a structured dataset entry ready for review or further processing.
