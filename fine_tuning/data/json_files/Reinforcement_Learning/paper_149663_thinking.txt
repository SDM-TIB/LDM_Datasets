To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-based Reinforcement Learning meets Mixed Integer Programs: An application to 3D robot assembly discovery" by Niklas Funk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method's performance on a set of competitive simulated RAD environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In the experimental results section, the authors state that they created a dataset containing **50,000 different scenes** to train their agents. This dataset is crucial for understanding the environments in which their robotic assembly discovery (RAD) method operates.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

The dataset I identified is:

1. **RAD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 different scenes that describe the initial state of the environment for training the agents. It is specifically designed for the experiments conducted in this paper.

Since this dataset is created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation in the references section. However, I will document it as follows:

- For the **RAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Niklas Funk, Svenja Menzenbach, Georgia Chalvatzaki, and Jan Peters. *Graph-based Reinforcement Learning meets Mixed Integer Programs: An application to 3D robot assembly discovery*. Preprint.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing.
