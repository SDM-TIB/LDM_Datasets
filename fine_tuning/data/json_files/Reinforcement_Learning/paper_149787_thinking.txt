To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Emotional Volatility Using 41,000 Participants in the United Kingdom" by George MacKerron and Nattavudh Powdthavee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from over **41,000 UK individuals**, which suggests a large dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention using the **Mappiness app**, which is a significant dataset for this study. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, the nature of the data collected, and the time frame of the data collection.

In the methods section, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Mappiness dataset**, stating that it includes over **three million responses** from **41,023 participants**. This dataset is collected through an experience sampling method (ESM), which allows for high-frequency data collection on participants' moment-to-moment happiness.

I will also check the **data availability statement** to confirm how the dataset can be accessed or referenced. The authors note that the individual-level data are not publicly available but can be requested for academic research purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

1. **Mappiness Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > MacKerron, G., & Mourato, S. (2013). Happiness is greater in natural environments. *Global Environmental Change*, 23, 992â€“1000. 

This citation is important as it provides the source of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the correct citation format for future reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
