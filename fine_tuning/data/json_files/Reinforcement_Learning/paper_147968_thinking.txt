To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Robotics and Control with Active Uncertainty Reduction" by Narendra Patwardhan and Zequn Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning methods and mentions validation on "several classic reinforcement learning problems in OpenAI gym," which suggests that datasets from OpenAI Gym may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe two specific case studies: the **Inverted Pendulum** and **Cart Pole Balance** environments. These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

In the **Inverted Pendulum** section, the authors describe the problem setup, including the state and action spaces, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation since it is a simulation environment. However, I will note that the environment is part of OpenAI Gym.

Similarly, in the **Cart Pole Balance** section, the authors describe the environment and its parameters, again indicating that it is part of OpenAI Gym without a specific dataset citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for OpenAI Gym, which is the source of the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since both the Inverted Pendulum and Cart Pole Balance environments are part of OpenAI Gym, I will use this citation for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for OpenAI Gym for both environments used in the experiments. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Inverted Pendulum**: Part of OpenAI Gym.
2. **Cart Pole Balance**: Part of OpenAI Gym.

Both datasets will reference the same citation for OpenAI Gym. 

Now, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and included.
