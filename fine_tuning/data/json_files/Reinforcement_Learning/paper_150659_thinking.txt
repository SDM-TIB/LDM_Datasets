To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety-Aware Task Composition for Discrete and Continuous Reinforcement Learning" by Kevin Leahy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, which typically includes the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the environments used for testing their methods. They mention three environments:
1. A 2D static grid world with row and column observation spaces.
2. A 2D item collection grid world with image observations.
3. A 3D physics simulation, Bullet-Safety-Gym.

I will note that while these environments are described, they may not be traditional datasets in the sense of labeled data collections. However, they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the environments or datasets. The authors may cite foundational works or datasets that are integral to their experiments. 

For the environments mentioned:
- The **Bullet-Safety-Gym** is referenced, and I will look for its citation in the references section to provide a complete citation for it.

After gathering this information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets or environments referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each entry is well-documented and ready for further use or analysis.
