To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Design Choices in Proximal Policy Optimization" by Chloe Ching-Yun Hsu, Celestine Mendler-Dünner, and Moritz Hardt, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments"** or **"Datasets"**. In this paper, I will focus on the sections where the authors discuss their experimental setup and the environments they used for testing their proposed methods.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using various environments from the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. Specifically, they refer to several **MuJoCo tasks** and provide a table listing the environments along with their observation and action dimensions.

The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **OpenAI Gym MuJoCo Environments**: The authors conducted experiments on eight MuJoCo tasks available in the OpenAI Gym. The environments include:
   - Walker2d
   - Humanoid
   - Swimmer
   - Hopper
   - HalfCheetah
   - InvertedPendulum
   - Reacher
   - InvertedDoublePendulum

   The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **MuJoCo**: The environments are based on the MuJoCo physics engine, which is commonly used for simulating robotic tasks. The citation for MuJoCo is:
   > Emo Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026–5033, 2012.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will extract the datasets from the paper by focusing on the relevant sections, identifying the datasets mentioned, and ensuring to include full citations for each dataset used in the research.
