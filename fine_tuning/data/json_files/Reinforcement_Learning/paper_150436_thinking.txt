To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Multiple Algorithm Configurations" by Leonid Keselman and Martial Hebert, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not list datasets directly, it can hint at their presence.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section IV)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention several application domains and the datasets associated with them:

1. **Synthetic Function**: The authors describe a synthetic function used for characterizing their methods. However, this does not refer to a publicly available dataset, so I will not include it.

2. **Dense Stereo Matching**: The authors mention using the **Middlebury Stereo datasets** (2014 and 2021) for their experiments. This is a clear dataset reference.

3. **Differentiable Rendering**: The dataset includes sequences from the **KITTI odometry dataset**. This is another important dataset that needs to be documented.

4. **Visual Odometry**: The authors refer to the **TUM VI Visual-Inertial Dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is also significant and should be included.

5. **Commercial Depth Sensor**: The authors mention evaluating configurations on scenes collected using an Intel RealSense D435, but they do not specify a formal dataset name for this part.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets identified:

- For the **Middlebury Stereo datasets**, the citation is:
  > D. Scharstein, H. Hirschmüller, Y. Kitajima, G. Krathwohl, N. Nešić, X. Wang, and P. Westling. *High-resolution stereo datasets with subpixel-accurate ground truth*. In Pattern Recognition, X. Jiang, J. Hornegger, and R. Koch, Eds. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2014, pp. 31–42.

- For the **KITTI odometry dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For the **TUM VI Visual-Inertial Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Schubert, T. Goll, N. Demmel, V. Usenko, J. Stueckler, and D. Cremers. *The TUM VI benchmark for evaluating visual-inertial odometry*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), October 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset identified in the paper. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
