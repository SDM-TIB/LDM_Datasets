To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoders and Decoders for Quantum Expander Codes" by Sathwik Chadaga, Mridul Agarwal, and Vaneet Aggarwal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper references existing datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe those datasets to ensure I have the correct citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
