To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Action Maps for Mobile Manipulation" by Jimmy Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods and experiments sections typically detail the datasets employed in the research.

In the **abstract**, the authors discuss their approach to learning robotic navigation and mention using a simulation environment. This suggests that there may be datasets related to the simulation or specific environments used for training.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors describe their method and the context of mobile manipulation, but I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or datasets. The authors mention using a PyBullet simulation for training, which indicates that the dataset may be synthetic and generated within this simulation environment. I will note this as a dataset but will need to confirm if there are any specific dataset names or references.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the environments used for testing their approach. They mention four types of environments: SmallEmpty, SmallColumns, LargeColumns, and LargeDivider. These environments are crucial as they represent the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **PyBullet Simulation Dataset**: This dataset is generated within the PyBullet simulation environment, which is used for training the robotic agent. While it may not have a formal citation, it is essential to note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research.

2. **Environments**: The authors describe four specific environments used for testing:
   - **SmallEmpty**: A small rectangular environment with randomly placed objects.
   - **SmallColumns**: An environment with fixed obstacles (columns) added.
   - **LargeColumns**: A larger environment with more columns and objects.
   - **LargeDivider**: An environment with a single large divider that presents a navigation challenge.

While these environments are not traditional datasets with formal citations, they are integral to the research and should be documented.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the simulation environment or the specific environments mentioned. If there are no formal citations for the environments, I will note that they are part of the experimental setup without specific references.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their descriptions, ensuring to include any relevant citations or notes about the nature of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
