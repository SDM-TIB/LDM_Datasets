To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bounding Probabilities of Causation through the Causal Marginal Problem" by Numair Sani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analysis. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to clinical trials or public policy evaluations, as these are the contexts discussed in the abstract and introduction. I will also check for any references to datasets that might be used for bounding probabilities of causation.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find a dataset mentioned in the paper, I will note its name, a brief description, and then locate its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from a specific study or paper, I will ensure to cite that original source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
