To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Target-Based Temporal-Difference Learning" by Donghwan Lee and Niao He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often mentions datasets used for experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This structured summary will include the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations as found in the references section of the paper.
