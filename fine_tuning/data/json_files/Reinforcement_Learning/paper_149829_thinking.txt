To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-Agnostic Continual Reinforcement Learning: Gaining Insights and Overcoming Challenges" by Massimo Caccia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a synthetic task and the Meta-World benchmark, which suggests that these could be the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **methods** section, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using two benchmarks: 

1. **Synthetic Task Benchmark**: This benchmark involves maximizing a multidimensional quadratic function, which is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

2. **Meta-World Benchmark**: This benchmark includes 50 unique robotic manipulation tasks, which are explicitly stated to be used for evaluating their method.

I will then check the **experiments** section to confirm that these datasets are indeed utilized in their evaluations. The authors provide details about how they assess their hypotheses using these benchmarks, which reinforces their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Meta-World benchmark is cited as follows:

- For **Meta-World**, the citation is:
  > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement Learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019.

The synthetic task is a custom dataset created by the authors, so it does not have a formal citation but will be noted as such.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Meta-World benchmark and a description for the synthetic task. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
