To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithms For Extractive Summarization" by William Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 4.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they used the **CNN / Daily Mail dataset** for both training and testing. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

To gather more details about the dataset, I will look for any additional descriptions or specifications provided in the methodology or results sections. However, since the dataset is mentioned directly in section 4.3, I will note the key details provided: it contains over 90,000 article and summary pairs, which is significant for understanding the scale of the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN / Daily Mail dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. 2017.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Dataset Name**: CNN / Daily Mail dataset
   - **Description**: Contains over 90,000 article and summary pairs, used for training and testing in extractive summarization tasks.
   - **Full Citation**: Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the dataset details are clear and accessible for anyone reviewing the research.
