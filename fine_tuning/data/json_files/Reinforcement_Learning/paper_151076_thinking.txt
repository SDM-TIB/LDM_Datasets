To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Colored Noise in PPO: Improved Exploration and Performance Through Correlated Action Sampling" by Jakob Hollenstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a colored noise-based stochastic policy variant of PPO but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mention of specific environments or benchmarks used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on various benchmarks, including:

1. **4 Rooms Ant**
2. **4 Rooms Point**
3. **4 Rooms Swimmer**
4. **Ball in Cup (Catch)**
5. **Cartpole Balance**
6. **Cartpole Swingup**
7. **Cheetah Run**
8. **Door**
9. **Hopper Hop**
10. **Mountain Car**
11. **Pendulum Swingup**
12. **Reacher Hard**
13. **UMaze Ant**
14. **UMaze Point**
15. **UMaze Swimmer**
16. **Walker Run**

These environments are part of the DeepMind Control Suite and other reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., and Riedmiller, M. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv:1801.00690 [cs].

- For the **Atari Games benchmark**, which is referenced in the context of reinforcement learning, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., Graves, A., Riedmiller, M., Fidjeland, A. K., Ostrovski, G., Petersen, S., Beattie, C., Sadik, A., Antonoglou, I., King, H., Kumaran, D., Wierstra, D., Legg, S., and Hassabis, D. (2015). *Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning*. Nature, 518(7540): 529â€“533.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the experiments of the paper.
