To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SQIL: Imitation Learning via Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards" by Siddharth Reddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they run experiments in four image-based environments: **Car Racing**, **Pong**, **Breakout**, and **Space Invaders**, as well as three low-dimensional environments: **Humanoid**, **HalfCheetah**, and **Lunar Lander**. Each of these environments is likely associated with specific datasets or benchmarks.

I will also check the **appendix** and **references** sections for any additional details or citations related to the datasets used. The references may provide full citations for the datasets or the environments mentioned.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Car Racing**: This environment is part of the OpenAI Gym and is used for evaluating the SQIL method. The reference for the environment is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

2. **Pong**: Another environment from OpenAI Gym, used for testing SQIL. The same reference applies as for Car Racing.

3. **Breakout**: Also part of OpenAI Gym, with the same reference.

4. **Space Invaders**: This environment is similarly referenced from OpenAI Gym.

5. **Humanoid**: A low-dimensional environment from MuJoCo, which is referenced as:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

6. **HalfCheetah**: Another environment from MuJoCo, with the same reference as Humanoid.

7. **Lunar Lander**: This environment is also from OpenAI Gym, and the reference is the same as for the other Gym environments.

Now, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments, as this is crucial for proper documentation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference or analysis.
