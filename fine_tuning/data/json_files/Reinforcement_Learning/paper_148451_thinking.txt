To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Causal Reasoning in Language: Detecting Counterfactuals" by Nwaike Kelechi and Licheng Jiao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe their experimental design and the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention two tasks related to counterfactual detection, and I will check if they provide any dataset names or descriptions in this section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to a dataset used for training and testing their models. They mention:

1. **Task 1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of sentences labeled as Counterfactual (CF) or Non-Counterfactual (Non-CF). The training set has 13,000 samples, with 1,454 labeled as CF and 11,546 as Non-CF.

2. **Task 2 Dataset**: This dataset is structured for token classification, where antecedents and consequents are tagged within sentences. The training set for this task includes 3,551 CF examples and 1,950 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference a previous work by Son et al. (2017) that discusses a dataset built for counterfactual detection in social media texts. I will ensure to include this citation as it provides context for the datasets used.

The full citation for the dataset referenced is:
- Son, Y., Buffone, A., Raso, J., Larche, A., Janocko, A., Zembroski, K., ... & Ungar, L. (2017). *Recognizing counterfactual thinking in social media texts*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers) (pp. 654-658).

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **Task 1 Dataset**: A dataset for binary classification of sentences as Counterfactual or Non-Counterfactual.
2. **Task 2 Dataset**: A dataset for token classification, tagging antecedents and consequents in sentences.

I will ensure to include the citation for the dataset referenced from Son et al. (2017) to provide proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the experiments.
