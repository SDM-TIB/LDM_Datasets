To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Decision Rules Under Partial Identification" by Kohei Yata, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a summary of the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research.

2. **Identify Sections on Data and Methodology**: Next, I will look for sections that discuss the methodology or data used in the research. This could include sections explicitly titled "Data," "Datasets," or "Methodology." In these sections, the author may provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

3. **Look for Empirical Applications**: I will also check any empirical application sections, as these often describe the datasets used for analysis. For example, in this paper, the author discusses an empirical application to a school construction program in Burkina Faso, which likely involves specific datasets.

4. **Extract Dataset Information**: For each identified dataset, I will extract the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name or title of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., survey data, administrative data) and the context in which it was collected.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

5. **Consult the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking for specific papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each one.
