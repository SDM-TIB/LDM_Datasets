To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic formation of the structure of abstract machines in hierarchical reinforcement learning with state clustering" by Aleksandr I. Panov and Aleksey Skrynnik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may discuss the context and relevance of datasets in the study, while the experimental evaluation section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They mention two training environments and one test environment:

1. **Training Environment 1**: 
   - Height: 4
   - Width: 3
   - Number of cubes: 3
   - Episode length: 200
   - Tower target size: 3

2. **Training Environment 2**: 
   - Height: 5
   - Width: 4
   - Number of cubes: 4
   - Episode length: 500
   - Tower target size: 4

3. **Test Environment**: 
   - Height: 6
   - Width: 4
   - Number of cubes: 5
   - Episode length: 800
   - Tower target size: 5

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these environments. However, it appears that the environments are described in detail but not formally cited as datasets from other sources. Therefore, I will treat these environments as custom datasets created for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will compile the information about these environments into a structured format, ensuring to include the details of each environment as datasets. Since these environments are not derived from external datasets, I will note that they are custom experimental setups.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries with the necessary details, including the environment specifications, and ensure that I document the citation for the paper itself as the source of this information.

The full citation for the paper is:

With this information, I will create the dataset entries accordingly.
