To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal-Aware Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of Connected Autonomous Vehicles in Challenging Scenarios" by Zhili Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that the experiments are based on a specific dataset or simulation environment.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator, which is a well-known open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. I will check if they refer to any specific datasets or configurations used within the CARLA environment.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail various scenarios (Intersection, Highway, and Highway-Hard) but do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they describe the simulation setup and the behavior of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and hazard vehicles (HAZVs) within the CARLA simulator. This indicates that the data generated during these simulations is likely used for training and evaluation, but it does not reference any pre-existing datasets.

I will also review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references include various papers related to V2X communication, vehicle trajectory prediction, and safety-critical systems, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were used in this research.

Since the CARLA simulator is a key component of the experiments, I will provide its citation as it serves as the primary source of data for the experiments conducted in this paper. The citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used in the research. 

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Investigate the experiments section for specific datasets or simulation environments.
3. Review the references for any indirect mentions of datasets.
4. Document the CARLA simulator as the primary source of data for the experiments.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CARLA simulator based on the findings.
