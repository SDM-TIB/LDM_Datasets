To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilience of Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks" by Naoya Tezuka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Non-IID MNIST dataset** for their evaluations. This is a crucial dataset for understanding the resilience of the proposed method against model poisoning attacks.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a detailed configuration of the Non-IID MNIST dataset, which includes the distribution of samples across different nodes. This table is essential for understanding how the dataset is structured and utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically found in the literature. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Non-IID MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
