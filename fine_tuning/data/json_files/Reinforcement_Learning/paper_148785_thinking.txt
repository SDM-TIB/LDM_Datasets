To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Obtain Employee Turnover Rate and Optimal Reduction Strategy Based On Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning" by Xiaohan Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions using a predictive model based on employee data, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of predicting employee turnover and mentions the use of employee data for analysis. However, I need to look for specific datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **method section**, particularly where the author describes the data matrix and the sample data shared by the IBM Watson Analytics analysis platform. The paper states that the sample data contains **1101 employees**, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In the **experiment section**, the author confirms that the sample data from IBM Watson Analytics is utilized for training and testing the model. This reinforces the idea that this dataset is central to the research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper specifically refers to the sample data shared by IBM Watson Analytics, but it does not provide a formal citation. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is:

- **IBM Watson Analytics Employee Data**: This dataset contains 1101 employees with various features and labels, used for training and testing the predictive model.

Since there is no formal citation provided in the paper for this dataset, I will acknowledge that it is a proprietary dataset from IBM Watson Analytics, and I will note that in my final output.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, ensuring that I highlight the source of the dataset as IBM Watson Analytics.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, method, and experiment sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the IBM Watson Analytics dataset for employee data.
3. Note the lack of a formal citation but acknowledge the source as IBM Watson Analytics.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
