To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant MuZero" by Andreea Deac et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating the proposed method on two environments: **MiniPacman** and **Chaser**. This indicates that these environments may serve as datasets for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results** section, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they consider two 2D grid-world environments: **MiniPacman** and **Chaser**. They describe the characteristics of these environments, such as their symmetry and the nature of the tasks involved.

I will also check the **background** section for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks that may have been used in conjunction with MiniPacman and Chaser. However, it appears that these environments are procedural and specifically designed for the experiments in this paper, rather than being standard datasets from previous works.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. In this case, since MiniPacman and Chaser are procedural environments created for this study, I will provide citations for the papers that introduced these environments:

1. **MiniPacman**: The citation is:
   > Guez, A., Mirza, M., Gregor, K., Kabra, R., Racaniere, S., Weber, T., Raposo, D., Santoro, A., Orseau, L., Eccles, T., Wayne, G., Silver, D., & Lillicrap, T. (2019). An investigation of model-free planning. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 2464–2473. PMLR.

2. **Chaser**: The citation is:
   > Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2020). Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 2048–2056. PMLR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
