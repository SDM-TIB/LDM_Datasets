To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Generate Better Than Your LLM" by Jonathan D. Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented on the **IMDB positive sentiment**, **CommonGen**, and **TL;DR summarization tasks**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments** section. Here, the authors describe the tasks and provide context for each dataset:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating positive movie reviews. The authors mention that it consists of 25,000 training samples, 5,000 validation samples, and 5,000 test samples, specifically focusing on positive sentiment labels.

2. **CommonGen Dataset**: This dataset is described as a common sense text generation task where the model generates sentences based on a set of concepts. The authors refer to the original dataset creators for more detailed statistics.

3. **TL;DR Summarization Dataset**: The authors mention using a filtered dataset from Reddit for summarization tasks, specifically referencing the work by Völske et al. (2017) for the TL;DR task.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2011.

- For the **CommonGen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bill Yuchen Lin, Wangchunshu Zhou, Ming Shen, Pei Zhou, Chandra Bhagavatula, Yejin Choi, and Xiang Ren. *CommonGen: A Constrained Text Generation Challenge for Generative Commonsense Reasoning*. In Findings of Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP, 2020.

- For the **TL;DR Summarization Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael Völske, Martin Potthast, Shahbaz Syed, and Benno Stein. *TL;DR: Mining Reddit to Learn Automatic Summarization*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
