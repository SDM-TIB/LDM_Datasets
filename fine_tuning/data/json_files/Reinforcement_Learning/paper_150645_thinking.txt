To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action Q-Transformer: Visual Explanation in Deep Reinforcement Learning with Encoder-Decoder Model using Action Query" by Hidenori Itaya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their method in the context of deep reinforcement learning, particularly mentioning the use of **Atari 2600 games** for evaluation. This indicates that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **17 Atari 2600 games** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that the datasets consist of game environments and their respective data.

To ensure I have the correct names and details of the datasets, I will look for any specific references to the datasets used in the experiments. The authors do not provide individual dataset names but refer to the **Atari 2600 games** collectively. Therefore, I will treat the dataset as a single entity encompassing all the games mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the Atari 2600 games. While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I can reference the original source of the Atari 2600 games, which is commonly known in the field of reinforcement learning.

The citation for the Atari 2600 games is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Atari 2600 Games**: A collection of 17 games used for evaluating the proposed method.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry as needed.
