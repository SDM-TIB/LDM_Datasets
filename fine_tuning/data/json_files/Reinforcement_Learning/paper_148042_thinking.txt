To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Causal State Representations of Partially Observable Environments" by Amy Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on multiple partially observable tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **GridWorld Environments**: The authors created partially observable gridworld environments for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific citation for these environments as they are custom-built for the study.

2. **VizDoom**: The paper references a modified version of the VizDoom environment, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. The original citation for VizDoom is:
   > Michał Kempka, Marek Wydmuch, Grzegorz Runc, Jakub Toczek, and Wojciech Jaśkowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, pages 341–348, Santorini, Greece, Sep 2016.

3. **Atari Games**: The authors also evaluate their method on a suite of tasks from the Atari environment, which is widely used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for the Atari environment is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations. 

1. **GridWorld Environments**: Custom-built environments for the study (no citation).
2. **VizDoom**: 
   > Michał Kempka, Marek Wydmuch, Grzegorz Runc, Jakub Toczek, and Wojciech Jaśkowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, pages 341–348, Santorini, Greece, Sep 2016.
3. **Atari Games**: 
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented for future reference or processing.
