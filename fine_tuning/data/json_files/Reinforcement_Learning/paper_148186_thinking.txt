To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimalistic Attacks: How Little it Takes to Fool Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies" by Xinghua Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of adversarial attacks on six Atari games, which suggests that these games may be the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluate their methods on six representative Atari games: **Pong, Breakout, SpaceInvaders, Seaquest, Qbert, and BeamRider**. This confirms that these games are indeed the datasets utilized for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The Atari games are well-known datasets in the reinforcement learning community, and their original source is the OpenAI Gym. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not provide individual citations for each game, the OpenAI Gym citation serves as the authoritative source for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the Atari games.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
