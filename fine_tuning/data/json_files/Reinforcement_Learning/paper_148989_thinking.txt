To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-adaptive Torque Vectoring Controller Using Reinforcement Learning" by Shayan Taherian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a torque-vectoring controller and reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section II (Vehicle Model)** and **section IV (Reinforcement Learning Algorithm)** for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments. In these sections, the authors describe the vehicle model and the reinforcement learning framework but do not specify any datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** (which is not explicitly labeled but can be inferred from the context) to see if there are any datasets used for validation or testing. The authors mention simulations conducted under different conditions (e.g., varying velocities and friction surfaces), but again, they do not refer to any specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to external datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will still check the **References section** to see if any cited works might contain datasets relevant to the study.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several papers that may have datasets related to vehicle dynamics and control systems, but none are directly linked to the experiments conducted in this paper. 

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations as there are none to report.

If I were to find datasets in a similar paper, I would ensure to follow the same steps: read through the relevant sections, identify any datasets mentioned, and retrieve full citations from the references. This methodical approach helps ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately.
