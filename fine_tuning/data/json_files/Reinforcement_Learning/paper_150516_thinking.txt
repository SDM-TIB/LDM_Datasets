To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed-Integer Optimal Control via Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study on Hybrid Vehicle Energy Management" by Jinming Xu and Yuan Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed TD3AQ algorithm on a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) energy management problem, which suggests that there may be datasets related to vehicle dynamics or energy management.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction provides context about mixed-integer optimal control problems and mentions various approaches, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will then examine the **experiments section** closely. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that the TD3AQ algorithm is evaluated on the China heavy-duty transient cycle for light trucks (CHTC-LT). This is a specific dataset used for training and testing the algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CHTC-LT dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is a commonly used benchmark in the field of vehicle energy management. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is widely recognized but lacks a formal citation in this paper.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference various reinforcement learning algorithms and benchmarks, but they do not specify additional datasets beyond the CHTC-LT.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset:

1. **China Heavy-Duty Transient Cycle for Light Trucks (CHTC-LT)**: This dataset is used for training the TD3AQ algorithm in the context of PHEV energy management.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the CHTC-LT dataset, I will note that it is a standard dataset in the field, but I will not be able to provide a full citation as it is not included in the references.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing.
