To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced Deep Q-Learning for 2D Self-Driving Cars: Implementation and Evaluation on a Custom Track Environment" by Bidhya Shrestha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions the use of sensors, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the context of self-driving cars and reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the environment or data used for training the DQN model. The paper mentions using a custom driving environment developed with Pygame, which simulates a 2D track around the University of Memphis. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the performance of the DQN and modified DQN models but again do not mention any specific datasets. They refer to the use of sensor data collected from the car, but this is not a formal dataset.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. The authors cite several studies that utilize DQN and reinforcement learning in various environments, but they do not provide specific datasets used in those studies.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and frameworks rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets mentioned that can be extracted with full citations. The research primarily focuses on the implementation of a DQN model in a custom environment rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of sensor data and a custom simulation environment, it does not provide any specific datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries as there are none explicitly mentioned in the paper.
