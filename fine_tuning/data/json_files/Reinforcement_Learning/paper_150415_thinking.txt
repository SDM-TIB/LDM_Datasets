To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eventual Discounting Temporal Logic Counterfactual Experience Replay" by Cameron Voloshin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions of the paper, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets, as well as any descriptions that detail their characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors may describe the environments used for their experiments, which often include datasets or simulation environments. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I have the correct citation format.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Minecraft" or "Pacman," I will search for the original sources or papers that introduced these datasets. I will ensure to include all necessary citation details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for presentation or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and well-organized for any potential downstream applications.
