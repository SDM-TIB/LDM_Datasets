To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path Planning of Cleaning Robot with Reinforcement Learning" by Woohyeon Moon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental environments. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning for path planning in cleaning robots, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the **Cleaning Simulation Environment** subsection, where the authors describe the custom cleaning simulation environment they created. This section is crucial as it may contain details about the datasets or environments used for training and testing the cleaning robot.

In the **Proposed Method** section, the authors detail their approach, including techniques like transfer learning and reward shaping. However, they do not reference any external datasets; instead, they describe their own simulation environments (5x5 and 20x20 grids) used for experiments.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets relevant to the research. The references include various studies on reinforcement learning and robotics, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were used in this research.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors created their own simulation environments rather than using established datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not publicly available and are instead custom environments designed for this study.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Custom Cleaning Simulation Environment**: The authors created a 5x5 and a 20x20 cleaning simulation environment for their experiments. These environments are not publicly available datasets but are integral to the research.

2. **No External Datasets Cited**: The paper does not reference any external datasets or benchmarks, focusing instead on their own simulation environments.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will document this finding clearly, ensuring that the information is accurate and reflects the content of the paper.
