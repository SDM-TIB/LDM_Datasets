To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Groups of Instances Counterfactually for XAI: A Use Case, Algorithm and User Study for Group-Counterfactuals" by Greta Warren et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a user study and refers to a dataset used for building a classifier, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the use of the **Adult (Census) dataset** for predicting income levels. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the **Adult dataset**, describing it as containing census information with a mixture of continuous and categorical variables. This section confirms the dataset's relevance to their study.

I will also check the **references section** for the full citation of the dataset. The citation for the **Adult dataset** is provided as follows:
> Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Additionally, the authors mention that the **New Adult Datasets** could be used for examining group counterfactual explanations through the lens of fairness in XAI, which suggests another dataset but does not provide a specific citation in this paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Adult dataset** as it is the primary dataset used in their study.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **Adult (Census) dataset**, and its citation is noted for reference. I will ensure that this information is clearly presented for any further processing or review.
