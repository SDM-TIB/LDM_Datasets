To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble Bootstrapping for Q-Learning" by Oren Peer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new algorithm, Ensemble Bootstrapped Q-Learning (EBQL), but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the impact of reinforcement learning algorithms but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate EBQL on a suite of ATARI games. This indicates that there are datasets related to the ATARI environments used for their experiments.

I will look for any specific references to datasets in the **experiments** subsection. The authors mention that they tested their methods on 11 randomly chosen ATARI environments, which suggests that the ATARI Learning Environment (ALE) is the dataset they are using.

To confirm this, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the ATARI dataset. The ATARI Learning Environment is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I expect to find a citation for it.

The citation for the ATARI Learning Environment is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the dataset used in the experiments, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **ATARI Learning Environment**: A suite of games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing.
