To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XCS Classifier System with Experience Replay" by Anthony Stein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the experiments conducted. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention three well-known single-step problems:
1. **Real-Multiplexer Problem (RMP)**: A challenging binary classification problem with real-valued inputs.
2. **Mario Classification Problem**: A two-dimensional real-valued multi-class classification problem based on a pixel-art representation of Mario.
3. **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) Dataset**: A well-known dataset for classification tasks in medical data mining.

The authors also mention that they conducted experiments on three multi-step problems from the OpenAI Gym:
1. **nChain Problem**: A sequential decision-making problem.
2. **CartPole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
3. **MountainCar**: A problem where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**:
  > M. Lichman. 2013. UCI Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences.

- For the **Real-Multiplexer Problem** and **Mario Classification Problem**, I will refer to the original papers cited in the text:
  > Christopher Stone and Larry Bull. 2003. For Real! XCS with Continuous-Valued Inputs. *Evolutionary Computation*, 11(3), 298â€“336. https://doi.org/10.1162/106365603322365289.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
