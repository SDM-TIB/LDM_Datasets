To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action and Trajectory Planning for Urban Autonomous Driving with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Xinyang Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulator** for experiments, which suggests that this simulator may be a key dataset or environment used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any specific datasets or environments used for training and testing their models. In this case, the authors mention using **three maps from the CARLA simulator** for their experiments. I will need to note the names of these maps as they are part of the dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the environments used, specifically stating that they selected three maps: **Town02, Town03, and Town04**. This confirms that these maps are indeed the datasets utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is the primary dataset used in the experiments. The relevant citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A. M., & Koltun, V. (2017). Carla: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1-16).

Next, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The datasets I have identified are:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: This is the primary dataset used for the experiments, which includes various urban driving scenarios.
   - Full citation: 
     > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A. M., & Koltun, V. (2017). Carla: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1-16).

2. **Maps Used**: The specific maps from the CARLA simulator used in the experiments are:
   - **Town02**
   - **Town03**
   - **Town04**

While the maps themselves may not have separate citations, they are part of the CARLA simulator dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the full citations for the datasets and prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
