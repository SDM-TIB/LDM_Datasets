To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Robust Classification" by Xuwang Yin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, classes).

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their generative classifier on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. I will note that CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
