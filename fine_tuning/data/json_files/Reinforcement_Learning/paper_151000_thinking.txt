To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Sampling of Categorical Distributions Using the CatLog-Derivative Trick" by Lennert De Smet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for empirical validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets in the context of evaluating their proposed gradient estimator, IndeCateR. I will specifically look for sections that detail the datasets used in their experiments, such as any synthetic datasets or standard benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

If they refer to the **F-MNIST dataset**, I would find the citation:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are complete and formatted correctly, ready for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
