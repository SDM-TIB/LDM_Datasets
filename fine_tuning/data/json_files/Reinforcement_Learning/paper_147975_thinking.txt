To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Variance Reduction for Deep Q-learning" by Wei-Ye Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Atari domain**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to this domain.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their proposed algorithm on a collection of **20 games from the Arcade Learning Environment**. This is a significant clue that I need to investigate further.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsection within the experiments that explicitly lists the datasets. In this case, the authors refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment** as the dataset used for their experiments. I will need to gather more information about this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is as follows:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This dataset consists of a collection of 20 games that serve as a benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. It is known for its high-dimensional state representation and is widely used in the field.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations as required.
