To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Reinforcement Learning with Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem" by Jiongzhi Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **111 TSP benchmarks from the TSPLIB**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup and results sections**. In the experimental results section, the authors explicitly mention using **111 symmetric TSP instances from the TSPLIB**, which is a well-known dataset for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TSPLIB dataset. The TSPLIB is a standard dataset used in TSP research, and its citation is typically included in the references.

The citation for the TSPLIB is:
> G. Reinelt. *TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library*. ORSA Journal on Computing, 3(4):376-384, 1991.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format. The dataset I have identified is:

1. **TSPLIB**: A library of instances for the Traveling Salesman Problem, containing 111 benchmark instances with varying numbers of cities.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
