To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Unification and Robustness of Perturbation and Gradient Based Explanations" by Sushant Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their theory using "extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a **synthetic dataset** and two real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created for classification tasks with a two-dimensional feature space.
2. **Bankruptcy Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting bankruptcy of Polish companies and consists of features like net profit, sales, and inventory.
3. **Online Shopping Dataset**: This dataset contains instances of online shopping interactions, with features such as the number of pages visited and time spent on a page.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the real-world datasets mentioned:

- For the **Bankruptcy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zikeba, M., Tomczak, S., & Tomczak, J. (2016). Ensemble boosted trees with synthetic features generation in application to bankruptcy prediction. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 55, 1-10.

- For the **Online Shopping Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saka, O., Polat, O., Katircioglu, M., & Kastro, Y. (2019). Real-time prediction of online shoppersâ€™ purchasing intention using multilayer perceptron and LSTM recurrent neural networks. *Neural Computing and Applications*, 31, 6893-6908.

The synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation since it was generated for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and full citations for the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
