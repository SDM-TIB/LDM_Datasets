To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Checkmating One, by Using Many: Combining Mixture of Experts with MCTS to Improve in Chess" by Felix Helfenstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Kingbase Lite 2019 dataset**, which contains over one million chess games played by individuals rated at least 2200 Elo. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, so I will note its details.

I will also check the **data availability statement** and **appendices** for any additional datasets or specific configurations related to the datasets used. The paper mentions that they filtered out games shorter than five moves to ensure data reliability, which is an important detail for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kingbase Lite dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kingbase Lite 2019 dataset. Available at: https://archive.org/details/KingBaseLite2019.

Additionally, I will note that the authors refer to the Lichess game phase definitions, which they use to categorize the dataset into different phases (opening, middlegame, endgame). However, since the Lichess definitions are not a dataset in themselves, I will not include them in the dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the Kingbase Lite dataset, as it is essential for proper attribution and reproducibility.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Kingbase Lite 2019 Dataset**: A comprehensive collection of chess games used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
