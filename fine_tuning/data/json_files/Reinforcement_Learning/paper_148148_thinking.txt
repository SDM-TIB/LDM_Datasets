To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigation on the generalization of the Sampled Policy Gradient algorithm" by Stolt AnsÃ³, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methods to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the comparison of the Sampled Policy Gradient (SPG) algorithm with other algorithms in different environments. This suggests that datasets may be used in these environments, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will focus on the **section 2 (Environments and Tasks)**, where the author describes the environments used for the experiments. Here, I find two specific environments mentioned:

1. **Agar.io**: The paper describes a simplified version of the game Agar.io, where the player controls a cell to collect pellets. The dataset for this environment is derived from the game itself, but the author does not provide a formal citation for it.

2. **HalfCheetah-v2**: This environment is part of OpenAI's gym toolkit and is used for robotics tasks. The dataset for this environment is also not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is a well-known benchmark in the reinforcement learning community.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I find the following relevant citations:

- For **Agar.io**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, I can reference the original source of the game:
  > Agar.io. (2015). *Agar.io*. [Online Game]. Available at: https://agar.io

- For **HalfCheetah-v2**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Agar.io**: An online game dataset used for the pellet collection task.
   - Citation: Agar.io. (2015). *Agar.io*. [Online Game]. Available at: https://agar.io

2. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A robotics task dataset from OpenAI's gym toolkit.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. arXiv:1606.01540.

With this information, I am ready to create the final structured output for the datasets.
