To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Portfolio Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ashish Anil Pawar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it sets the context for what the paper addresses.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors discuss the data used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they extracted data for **28 assets** from **Yahoo Finance**, starting from **January 1, 2010** for stocks and **January 1, 2016** for cryptocurrencies. This indicates that the datasets are related to financial time series data.

I will also check the **results and analysis sections** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as their structure or specific attributes. The paper mentions that the time-series data includes parameters like **closed price, open price, highest price, lowest price, volume, and adjusted close price**. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' content.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations like traditional datasets (e.g., Penn Action Dataset), but it does reference the source of the financial data:

- For the **Yahoo Finance dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. "Historical Data." [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) (Accessed: 2023).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or provide additional citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Yahoo Finance Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical financial data for 28 assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, with various attributes such as price and volume.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing.
