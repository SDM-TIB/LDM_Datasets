To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data" by Michael Laskin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention using the **DeepMind Control Suite** and **OpenAI Gym** benchmarks. I will need to identify if these benchmarks refer to specific datasets or collections of environments.

In the **5.1 Setup** subsection, the authors specify that they evaluate their method on the **DeepMind Control Suite (DMControl)**, which is a collection of environments for reinforcement learning. They also mention the **OpenAI ProcGen benchmarks** for generalization capabilities. I will need to confirm if these are considered datasets in the context of the paper.

In the **5.2 Improving data-efficiency on DeepMind Control Suite** subsection, the authors list specific environments used for evaluation, such as **Cheetah, Walker, Hopper, Ant, Pendulum, and Cartpole**. These environments are part of the DMControl suite and are relevant for my dataset extraction.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. The paper cites the following:

- For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

- For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: A collection of environments for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Citation: Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Citation: Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
