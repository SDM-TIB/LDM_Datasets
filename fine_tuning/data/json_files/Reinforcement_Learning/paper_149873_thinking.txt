To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Platoon Control with Integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Programming" by Tong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors performed simulations using real driving data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors specify that they used data extracted from the **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors describe how they used the NGSIM dataset, which was retrieved from the eastbound I-80 in the San Francisco Bay area on April 13, 2005. They also mention that the data was collected at a sampling rate of 10 Hz, with 45 minutes of precise location data, and that they used 1000 car-following events extracted from this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The citation for the NGSIM dataset is typically as follows:
> "U.S. Department of Transportation. NGSIM â€“ Next Generation Simulation, 2009."

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **NGSIM Dataset**: This dataset was used for simulation in the experiments. It contains precise location data collected from vehicles on the eastbound I-80 in the San Francisco Bay area, with a sampling rate of 10 Hz over a duration of 45 minutes. The authors utilized 1000 car-following events extracted from this dataset.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
