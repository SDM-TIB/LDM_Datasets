To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Reinforcement Learning for Turn-based Zero-sum Markov Games" by Devavrat Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **related work and references sections**. Authors often cite previous works that introduced the datasets they are using, which can provide additional context and the full citation needed for each dataset.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for the full citation, which might be:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549, 2016.

After compiling this information, I will format it according to the requirements specified in the task, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the entire extraction process to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all relevant information is accurately captured.
