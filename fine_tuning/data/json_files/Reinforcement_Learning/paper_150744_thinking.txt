To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Deep Learning-based Solar Flare Prediction with post hoc Attention for Operational Forecasting" by Chetraj Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used "hourly full-disk line-of-sight magnetogram images," which suggests that this is a primary dataset used for their model.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Model)**, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe the dataset as "full-disk LoS solar magnetograms obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)." They mention that these images are available as compressed JP2 images and provide a link to Helioviewer for access.

The authors also specify the time frame of the data collection, stating that they sampled hourly instances from December 2010 to December 2018, resulting in a total of 63,649 images. They categorize these images based on the maximum peak X-ray flux into two classes: "No Flare" (NF: <M1.0) and "Flare" (FL: ≥M1.0), with specific counts for each class.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **HMI magnetograms**, the citation is:
  > Pesnell, W., Thompson, B.J., & Chamberlin, P.C. (2011). The solar dynamics observatory (SDO). *Solar Physics*, 275(1-2), 3–15. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-011-9841-3

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
