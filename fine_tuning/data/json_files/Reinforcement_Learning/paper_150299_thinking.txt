To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized model-free reinforcement learning in stochastic games with average-reward objective" by Romain Cravic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract primarily discusses the proposed algorithm and its performance, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of reinforcement learning and its applications in competitive multi-agent settings. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here either. I will continue to the **experiments section** to check for any datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This is typically where datasets are described. If the authors conducted experiments, they would likely mention the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, they will typically provide citations that can be used to locate the datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or common name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Game Dataset" used in their experiments, I would document it as follows:
- **Name**: Game Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing various game scenarios used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Citation**: Author(s). *Title of the dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are accurate and formatted correctly according to the relevant citation style used in the paper.
