To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HackAtari: Atari Learning Environments for Robust and Continual Reinforcement Learning" by Quentin Delfosse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the HackAtari framework and its modifications to the Atari Learning Environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets that the authors have utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention **HackAtari** as a framework that introduces variations to the Atari Learning Environment, but they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they describe modifications to existing Atari games, which are part of the Atari Learning Environment itself.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets outside of the Atari Learning Environment, I will note that the primary dataset referenced is the **Atari Learning Environment** itself, which is a widely recognized benchmark in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the Atari Learning Environment in the references section to ensure I have the correct citation for this dataset. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:

- **Atari Learning Environment**:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 2013.

Since the paper primarily discusses modifications to the Atari games rather than introducing new datasets, I will summarize my findings accordingly.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari Learning Environment as the primary dataset referenced in the paper.
