To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taking Snapshots from a Stream" by Dominik Bojko and Jacek CichoÅ„, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract discusses probabilistic snapshots and applications, but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction also focuses on the methodology without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **applications section (Section 4)**, as this is likely where datasets might be referenced. In **Section 4.2**, the authors mention using "bitcoin cap data from [quandl(2017)]" to test their probabilistic snapshots. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically related to Bitcoin capitalization.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The reference for the Bitcoin data is:

> quandl. Bitcoin mining statistics. https://www.quandl.com/data/BITCOINWATCH/MINING, 2017.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including the source and the year of publication.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the methodology and the application of the proposed techniques rather than on multiple datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Bitcoin dataset.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Bitcoin Cap Data**: Used for testing probabilistic snapshots, sourced from Quandl.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> quandl. Bitcoin mining statistics. https://www.quandl.com/data/BITCOINWATCH/MINING, 2017.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
