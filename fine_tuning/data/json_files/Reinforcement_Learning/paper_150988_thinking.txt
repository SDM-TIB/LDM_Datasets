To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Driving using Spiking Neural Networks on Dynamic Vision Sensor Data: A Case Study of Traffic Light Change Detection" by Xuelei Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it does not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the author discusses the use of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and dynamic vision sensors (DVSs). Here, the author mentions that the project uses data collected from the CARLA simulator, which indicates that there may be specific datasets associated with this simulator.

In the **related work section**, the author lists several real DVS datasets, including **DVS128 Gesture**, **ASL-DVS**, **DSEC**, and **GEN1**. This is a crucial point as it identifies datasets that have been used in previous research and may be relevant to the current study.

Moving to the **methodology section**, the author describes the data collection process, specifically mentioning that DVS data and RGB data are collected from the CARLA simulator. The author notes that the training data covers four different weather conditions and includes a total of sixty double-frame sequences. This indicates that the CARLA simulator data is a significant dataset for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the author discusses the different combinations of sensors and networks used, confirming the use of the CARLA simulator data for training and testing the SNN model.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is essential for proper attribution in research contexts.
