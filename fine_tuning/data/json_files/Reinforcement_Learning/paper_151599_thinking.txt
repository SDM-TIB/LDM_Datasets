To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancements for Real-Time Monte-Carlo Tree Search in General Video Game Playing" by Dennis J. N. J. Soemers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses enhancements to Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and mentions evaluating these enhancements across various games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluated their enhancements using six sets of games, each containing ten different games, totaling sixty games. This indicates that the datasets are likely the collections of games used in the experiments.

I will then look for a **table or list** that details the names of the games included in these sets. In the paper, there is a section titled **Table VI**, which lists the names of the games in every set. This is crucial information for identifying the datasets.

The games listed in **Table VI** are as follows:
1. **Set 1**: Aliens, Boulderdash, Butterflies, Chase, Frogs, Missile Command, Portals, Sokoban, Survive Zombies, Zelda
2. **Set 2**: Camel Race, Digdug, Firestorms, Infection, Firecaster, Overload, Pacman, Seaquest, Whackamole, Eggomania
3. **Set 3**: Bait, BoloAdventures, BrainMan, ChipsChallenge, Modality, Painter, RealPortals, RealSokoban, TheCitadel, ZenPuzzle
4. **Set 4**: Roguelike, Surround, Catapults, Plants, Plaque-Attack, Jaws, Labyrinth, Boulderchase, Escape, Lemmings
5. **Set 5**: Solarfox, Defender, Enemy Citadel, Crossfire, Lasers, Sheriff, Chopper, Superman, WaitForBreakfast, CakyBaky
6. **Set 6**: Lasers 2, Hungry Birds, Cook me Pasta, Factory Manager, Race Bet 2, Intersection, Black Smoke, Ice and Fire, Gymkhana, Tercio

Next, I will check the **References section** to find citations for any datasets or frameworks mentioned. The paper references the GVG-AI framework, which is essential for understanding the context of the datasets used. The relevant citation for the GVG-AI framework is:
> D. Perez, S. Samothrakis, J. Togelius, S. M. Lucas, and T. Schaul. "General Video Game AI: Competition, Challenges and Opportunities." In Proc. of the Thirtieth AAAI Conf. on Artif. Intell. AAAI Press, 2016, pp. 4335â€“4337.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the citation.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
