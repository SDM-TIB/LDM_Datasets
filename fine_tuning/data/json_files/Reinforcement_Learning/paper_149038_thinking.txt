To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TREC Deep Learning Track: Reusable Test Collections in the Large Data Regime" by Nick Craswell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the reuse of TREC DL test collections, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or test collections**. In this paper, the relevant section is **Section 3 (Test Collection Data)**, where the authors describe various datasets in detail. I will carefully read through this section to identify all datasets mentioned.

From my reading, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is referenced as the source of large training sets based on human relevance assessments. It is crucial for both document and passage retrieval tasks.

2. **TREC 2019 Test Set**: This test set is used for evaluating document retrieval and passage retrieval tasks, containing 200 queries.

3. **TREC 2020 Test Set**: Similar to the 2019 set, this also contains queries for evaluation, with 200 queries for document retrieval and passage retrieval tasks.

4. **ORCAS**: A large-scale click dataset constructed from search engine logs, mentioned as being useful for additional training data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder, Andrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen, et al. 2016. MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268.

- For **TREC 2019 Test Set**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. 2020. Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track. In Proc. TREC.

- For **TREC 2020 Test Set**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. 2021. Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track. In Proc. TREC.

- For **ORCAS**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Daniel Campos, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Bodo Billerbeck. 2020. ORCAS: 18 Million Clicked Query-Document Pairs for Analyzing Search. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.05324.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
