To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte-Carlo tree search with uncertainty propagation via optimal transport" by Tuan Dam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of environments or benchmarks used for empirical evaluations. For example, the authors may refer to specific environments like "FrozenLake," "NChain," "RiverSwim," "SixArms," "Taxi," and "Rocksample." Each of these environments is likely to be associated with a dataset or a simulation setup.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions the "FrozenLake" environment, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known benchmark, I might also cross-reference it with existing literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will review my entries to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction process. This systematic approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
