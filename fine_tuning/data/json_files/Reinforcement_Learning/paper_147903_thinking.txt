To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning in policy evaluation: new tools for causal inference" by NoÃ©mi Kreif and Karla DiazOrdaz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on machine learning methods for causal inference, but it may not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the application of machine learning in causal inference but does not seem to mention datasets at this point.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their analysis. In the text, they mention an illustrative example involving an impact evaluation of a social health insurance program in Indonesia, which suggests that there is a dataset related to this evaluation.

Upon further reading, I find that the authors refer to the **Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS)**, which is the dataset used for their analysis. They describe it as containing births between 2002 and 2014, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Indonesian Family Life Survey. The citation is not provided directly in the text, so I will need to look for it in the references. After reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the IFLS:

- **Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS)**: 
  > Strauss, J., Witoelar, F., & Sikoki, B. (2016). *The Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS): Overview and Data Collection*. RAND Corporation.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS)**: This dataset includes information on births from 2002 to 2014, used to evaluate the impact of a health insurance program on assisted births.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
