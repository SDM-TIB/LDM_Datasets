To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Random Weight Change Algorithm for the Learning of Multilayer Neural Networks" by Sarker Mohammad Ibrahim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various neural network implementations and reference some previous works, but they do not specify any datasets used in their experiments. I will continue to the **results section** to see if any datasets are mentioned there.

In the **results section**, the authors state that they trained their Genetic Random Weight Change (GRWC) algorithm with "100 images of the MNIST dataset." This is a clear indication that the MNIST dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically available in the literature. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will create an entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry for this paper.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for review or further processing.
