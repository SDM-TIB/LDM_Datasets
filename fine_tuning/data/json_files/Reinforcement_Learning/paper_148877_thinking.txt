To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Urban Change Detection by Fully Convolutional Siamese Concatenate Network with Attention" by Farnoosh Heidarya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of change detection in remote sensing and mention the use of deep learning methods. However, they do not specify any datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Dataset**: This dataset contains Sentinel 2 multidimensional images acquired between 2015 and 2018 from various locations around the world. It includes 14 image pairs with pixel-level change ground truth provided, focusing on urban changes.

2. **LIVER-CD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 637 high-resolution images that include various types of buildings. It focuses on building-related changes and provides binary labels for changed and unchanged pixels.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caye Daudt, R., Le Saux, B., and Boulch, A. (2018). *Fully convolutional siamese networks for change detection*. Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, pp. 4063â€“4067. doi: 10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451652.

- For the **LIVER-CD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H. and Shi, Z. (2020). *A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection*. Remote Sensing, 12(10). doi: 10.3390/rs12101662.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
