To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Data Expansion for Customer-Care Spoken Language Understanding" by Shahab Jalalvand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the challenges of training language models (LM) and natural language understanding (NLU) models due to limited in-domain data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors outline the issues with traditional SLU systems and mention the need for sufficient data to train models. They refer to using an out-of-domain (OOD) corpus, which indicates that there is a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Data Expansion Approaches)**, the authors describe the resources they used, including the **out-of-domain (OOD) corpus** that contains 58 million utterances from 29 customer care applications. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and context.

I will also look at **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the in-domain data for their experiments. They mention that for application A, there are 780 <audio, intent> samples, and for application B, there are 910 <audio, intent> samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to various techniques and models, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. However, I can summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

1. **Out-of-Domain (OOD) Corpus**: This dataset consists of 58 million utterances from 29 customer care applications. It is used to train the language model and NLU model.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **In-Domain Data for Application A**: This dataset contains 780 <audio, intent> samples, with 10 audio samples per intent across 78 different intents.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

3. **In-Domain Data for Application B**: This dataset consists of 910 <audio, intent> samples, with 10 audio samples per intent across 91 different intents.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations, even if they are not explicitly stated in the paper. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
