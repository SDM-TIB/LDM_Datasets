To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dimensionality Reduction for Improving Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Image Segmentation" by McKell Woodland et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in medical imaging, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generalizing deep learning models in the medical field, which hints at the use of specific datasets for training and testing. However, I need to look further into the methods section for explicit mentions of datasets.

In **section 2.1 (Data)**, the authors detail the datasets used for training and testing their segmentation model. They mention:

1. **Duke Liver MRI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and is referenced as coming from a specific source.
2. **AMOS Dataset**: Another dataset used for training, which is also referenced.
3. **CHAOS Dataset**: This dataset is included in the training data as well.
4. **Testing Data**: The authors mention that they used 27 T1-weighted liver MRIs from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for testing, along with an additional 23 T1-weighted liver MRIs flagged for poor image quality.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Duke Liver MRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Macdonald, J.A., Zhu, Z., Konkel, B., Mazurowski, M., Wiggins, W., Bashir, M. (2020). *Duke Liver Dataset (MRI) v2 (2.0.0)* [Data set]. Zenodo.

- For the **AMOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, Y., et al. (2022). *AMOS: A large-scale abdominal multi-organ benchmark for versatile medical image segmentation*. In: Koyejo, S., Mohamed, S., Agarwal, A., Belgrave, D., Cho, K., Oh, A. (eds) NeurIPS 2022, Adv. neural inf. process. syst., vol. 35, pp. 36722-36732. Curran Associates, Inc.

- For the **CHAOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kavur, A.E., Selver, M.A., Dicle, O., Barus, M., Gezer, N.S. (2019). *CHAOS - Combined (CT-MR) healthy abdominal organ segmentation challenge data v1.03* [Data set]. Zenodo.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
