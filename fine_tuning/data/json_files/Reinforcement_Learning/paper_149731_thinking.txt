To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization Learning based Control of Congested Freeway Traffic" by Shurong Mo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may discuss the context of the research and any datasets used for comparison or validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used for simulations or comparisons, particularly in the **simulation results section**. The authors may describe the parameters and conditions under which the simulations were conducted, which can provide insights into the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "ARZ Traffic Model," I will look for its original source in the references. If the dataset is derived from a previous study, I will cite that original study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and complete for any future use.
