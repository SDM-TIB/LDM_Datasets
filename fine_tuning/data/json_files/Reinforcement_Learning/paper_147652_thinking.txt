To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Control for Air Hockey Striking using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ayal Taitler and Nahum Shimkin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation environment and the parameters used, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets or benchmarks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe a custom-built simulation environment modeled after an air hockey robotic system, which suggests that the data used for training and evaluation is generated from this simulation rather than sourced from an external dataset.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will note that the authors utilized a simulation environment based on OpenAI Gym for their experiments. This is important to mention as it provides context for the data used in their research.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Simulation Environment**: The authors used a custom-built simulation based on OpenAI Gym, which serves as the environment for training their reinforcement learning algorithm.

2. **Citation for OpenAI Gym**: 
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540 (2016).

Since there are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude my extraction process here. I will summarize the findings and prepare to present them in the required format.
