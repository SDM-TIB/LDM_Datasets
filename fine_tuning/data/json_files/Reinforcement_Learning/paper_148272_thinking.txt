To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Polygames: Improved Zero Learning" by Tristan Cazenave et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the release of "Polygames" along with its library of games and checkpoints, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games. However, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** and **success stories** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for evaluation. In section 3 (Success stories), the authors discuss their achievements in games like Hex and Havannah, but they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also look for a dedicated **datasets** section, but it appears that this paper does not have one. Instead, the authors mention various games and their performance, which implies that the datasets may be the game states or configurations used during training and evaluation.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will refer to the **References section** to identify any datasets that might be associated with the games mentioned. However, the references primarily cite other works and do not provide specific datasets.

Given that the paper emphasizes the framework and its capabilities rather than specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no formally named datasets provided in this paper. Instead, the authors focus on the framework's performance across various games, which may imply the use of game states as datasets.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the framework and its applications, it does not explicitly list any datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will not be able to provide dataset entries as there are no specific datasets mentioned in the text.
