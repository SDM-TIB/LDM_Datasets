To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M2DQN: A Robust Method for Accelerating Deep Q-learning Network" by Zhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on several gym environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section IV)**, where the authors describe the environments used for testing their method. They specifically mention four gym environments:

1. **CartPole-v1**: This environment is a classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
2. **LunarLander-v2**: This environment simulates a lunar lander that must be landed safely on the moon's surface.
3. **MountainCar-v0**: In this environment, the goal is to drive a car up a hill, which requires building momentum.
4. **Acrobot-v1**: This is a more complex environment where the objective is to swing a two-link robot to reach a certain height.

The authors provide performance metrics for these environments, indicating that they are indeed the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the gym environments mentioned. The paper cites the OpenAI Gym, which is the source for these environments:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will use this citation for all four environments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source for the environments used in the experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
