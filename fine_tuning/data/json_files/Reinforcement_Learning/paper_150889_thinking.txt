To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepQTest: Testing Autonomous Driving Systems with Reinforcement Learning and Real-World Weather Data" by Chengjie Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world weather data" and "industrial-scale ADS," which suggests that datasets related to weather conditions and autonomous driving scenarios may be included.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. In this case, the **methodology section** discusses the introduction of real-world weather data into the simulated environment, which indicates that there is a dataset associated with weather conditions. I will also check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenWeather Dataset**: This dataset is used to introduce real-world weather conditions into the simulation. The paper describes how it maps real-world weather data to the simulated environment, which is crucial for ensuring the realism of the test scenarios.

2. **Apollo Dataset**: The paper mentions using Baidu's Apollo platform as the subject system under test. While it does not provide a specific dataset name, it implies that the Apollo platform has associated datasets for testing autonomous driving systems.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **OpenWeather Dataset**, the citation is:
  > OpenWeather. OpenWeather API. Available at: https://openweathermap.org/api.

- For the **Apollo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Baidu Apollo team. Apollo: Open source autonomous driving, 2017. Available at: https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for further use or analysis.
