To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EASpace: Enhanced Action Space for Policy Transfer" by Zheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation or experiments. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted. This section may detail the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits (e.g., training, validation, test) that were employed.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their method on the datasets, which can provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized. If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references. If the dataset is a well-known benchmark, I may also cross-reference it with existing literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
