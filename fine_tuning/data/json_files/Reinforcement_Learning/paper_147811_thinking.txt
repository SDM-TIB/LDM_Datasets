To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconciling Î»-Returns with Experience Replay" by Brett Daley and Christopher Amato, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets, such as "Atari 2600 games" mentioned in the context of experiments. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using the "OpenAI Gym" for Atari games, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

If the paper discusses specific Atari games, I will ensure to note that these games are part of the dataset provided by the OpenAI Gym.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
