To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularly Updated Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm" by Shuai Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments in **Mujoco environments**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they used continuous control tasks provided by **Mujoco** based on **OpenAI Gym** to evaluate the performance of their algorithms. This indicates that the Mujoco environments are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the Mujoco environments and OpenAI Gym. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations for Mujoco or OpenAI Gym, as these are widely recognized resources in the reinforcement learning community. However, I can provide general citations for these resources based on common knowledge:

1. **Mujoco**:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026â€“5033).

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its corresponding citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Mujoco environments** (general reference)
- **OpenAI Gym** (general reference)

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
