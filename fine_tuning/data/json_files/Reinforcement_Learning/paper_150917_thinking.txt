To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sim-to-Real Transfer of Adaptive Control Parameters for AUV Stabilization under Current Disturbance" by Thomas Chaffre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for training adaptive control methods for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenges faced in underwater robotics but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the methodology, the authors describe the experimental setup involving a modified Blue Robotics BlueROV 2 Heavy configuration, but they do not mention specific datasets.

I will then check the **results** and **discussion** sections. Here, the authors present experimental results comparing the learning-based adaptive controller to a model-based counterpart. They discuss the performance metrics but do not reference any datasets directly.

Finally, I will examine the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the paper primarily focuses on the methodology and results of their own experiments without referencing external datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or cited within the text. The authors focus on the experimental setup and results derived from their own simulations and real-world evaluations rather than utilizing publicly available datasets.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets in this research.

In conclusion, while the paper presents a comprehensive study on adaptive control for AUVs, it does not reference any external datasets, focusing instead on the experimental results obtained from their own developed systems and simulations.
