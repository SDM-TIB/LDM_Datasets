To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Coordination among Multiple Traffic Intersections Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Ujwal Padam Tewari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Setting)**, which describes the simulation environment and the data used for training the reinforcement learning agents. Here, the authors mention using **Aimsun Next** for simulating realistic traffic conditions, but I need to confirm if they provide any specific datasets or data sources.

In **section 3.1 (Environment)**, the authors refer to using real traffic measurements, specifically mentioning that the collected data follows a Weibull distribution. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will also check the **results and conclusions sections** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used in their experiments or any additional datasets that may have been referenced throughout the paper.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the information regarding any datasets mentioned. If specific datasets are not explicitly named, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or data sources that are mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include the full citation for each.

In this case, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention any named datasets with full citations. Instead, it focuses on the simulation environment and the use of real traffic data without specifying a particular dataset. Therefore, I will summarize my findings accordingly, noting the lack of specific dataset citations.

Now, I will prepare to document my findings in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate any datasets identified, along with their citations if available.
