To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analytically Tractable Bayesian Deep Q-Learning" by Luong Ha Nguyen and James-A. Goulet, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using several environments from the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, specifically referring to the **Lunar Lander** and **Cart Pole** environments. These are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. Since the environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the appropriate citation for the OpenAI Gym itself.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments.

1. **Lunar Lander**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where the agent must land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. It is part of the OpenAI Gym.

2. **Cart Pole**: Another standard reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart. This environment is also part of the OpenAI Gym.

Both of these environments are widely used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research, and their citation is included in the OpenAI Gym reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and complete.
