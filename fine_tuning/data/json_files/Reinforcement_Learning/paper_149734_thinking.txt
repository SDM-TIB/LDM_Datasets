To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-CoSeg: A Novel Image Co-Segmentation Algorithm with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Xin Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset includes 11,540 images, with 2,913 images having segmentation masks. The authors note that they used a subset of 1,743 images for training.
2. **MSRC**: Comprising 591 images across 21 object groups, this dataset is noted for its rough ground-truth labeling.
3. **iCoseg**: This dataset contains 643 images divided into 38 object groups, with pixel-wise hand-annotated ground truth.
4. **Internet Dataset**: This dataset consists of thousands of downloaded images across three classes (airplane, car, and house), with each class having 100 images used for evaluation.
5. **MLMR-COS**: This dataset includes 16,002 images across five categories, specifically designed for co-segmentation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **MSRC**:
  > Shotton, J., Blake, A., & Rother, C. (2006). Semantic segmentation using random fields. *In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2006.

- For **iCoseg**:
  > Batra, D., & Ponce, J. (2010). iCoseg: Interactive co-segmentation of image collections. *In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2010.

- For **Internet Dataset**:
  > The dataset is typically referenced in the context of specific works that utilize it, so I will note that it is derived from various online sources without a formal citation.

- For **MLMR-COS**:
  > The dataset is mentioned in the context of specific research but does not have a formal citation in the references provided.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for any further processing or analysis.
