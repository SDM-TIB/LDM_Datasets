To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assured RL: Reinforcement Learning with Almost Sure Constraints" by Agustin Castellano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a Barrier-learning algorithm and mentions numerical experiments, which may imply the use of datasets, but does not specify any.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 5)**, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. In this section, the authors mention testing their algorithm on a **grid-world** environment, which is a common setup in reinforcement learning research. However, I need to confirm if this grid-world is a publicly available dataset or if it is a custom environment created for the experiments.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **conclusion** or **references section**. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not mention specific datasets. The references section lists various papers, but I need to check if any of these papers describe datasets that were used in the experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe a custom grid-world environment for their experiments. Since this environment is not a standard dataset, I will not include it in my dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered. Since there are no datasets to cite, I will note that the paper primarily utilizes a custom experimental setup rather than established datasets.

In summary, I will conclude that there are no datasets extracted from this paper, as the authors did not reference any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them. Instead, they focused on a custom grid-world environment for their experiments.
