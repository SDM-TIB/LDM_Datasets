To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture of Step Returns in Bootstrapped DQN" by Po-Han Chiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used in prior work or their own experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup. This section often details the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

The **experimental results section** is crucial as it typically summarizes the findings based on the datasets used. I will check for any tables or figures that might list the datasets along with their performance metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the Atari 2600 benchmark environments, as mentioned in the experiments. I will ensure to note down the full citations for any datasets referenced, such as:

- **Atari 2600 environments**: The citation for the Atari 2600 benchmark is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. In Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 4148â€“4152, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
