To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplifying Deep Temporal Difference Learning" by Matteo Gallici et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets used for empirical evaluations or comparisons.

As I read through the paper, I will note down any datasets mentioned along with their descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for training or testing their proposed algorithm, I will extract the name, purpose, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions using the **Atari Learning Environment** for experiments, I will look for the citation that corresponds to this dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the extracted information is accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
