To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Trajectory Prediction via Topological Invariance for Navigation at Uncontrolled Intersections" by Junha Roh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any initial mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors generated simulated datasets for their experiments, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. Here, they mention that existing open datasets do not contain sufficient interactions at uncontrolled intersections, leading them to generate their own datasets. They describe three datasets based on the number of agents involved:

1. **Dataset D2**: Contains 116,000 multiagent trajectories involving 2 agents.
2. **Dataset D3**: Contains 1,180,000 multiagent trajectories involving 3 agents.
3. **Dataset D4**: Contains 466,000 multiagent trajectories involving 4 agents.

The authors provide details about how these datasets were generated, including the parameters varied during the simulation, such as agents' destinations, target speeds, and acceleration/deceleration.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves and not from external sources, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note that these datasets are part of the authors' contributions and are described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context of their generation and the specific characteristics as outlined in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

- **Dataset D2**: 116,000 multiagent trajectories involving 2 agents.
- **Dataset D3**: 1,180,000 multiagent trajectories involving 3 agents.
- **Dataset D4**: 466,000 multiagent trajectories involving 4 agents.

Since these datasets are generated by the authors, I will note that they are described in the paper and do not have external citations. This will ensure that the information is clear and properly attributed to the authors' work.
