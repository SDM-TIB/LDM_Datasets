To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Data Augmentation for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather" by Junsung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **SemanticKITTI** and **SemanticSTF** datasets, which indicates that these are likely the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of LiDAR semantic segmentation under adverse weather conditions and reference the **SemanticKITTI** dataset as a source for training and validation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they trained their model on the **SemanticKITTI** dataset and validated it on the **SemanticSTF** dataset. They provide details about the performance metrics achieved on these datasets, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **SemanticKITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Behley, J., Garbade, M., Milioto, A., Quenzel, J., Behnke, S., Stachniss, C., & Gall, J. (2019). *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of LiDAR sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 9297–9307.

2. **SemanticSTF Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kong, L., Liu, Y., Li, X., Chen, R., Zhang, W., Ren, J., Pan, L., Chen, K., & Liu, Z. (2023). *Robo3D: Towards robust and reliable 3D perception against corruptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 19994–20006.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **SemanticKITTI**: A dataset for semantic segmentation of LiDAR sequences, used for training the model.
- **SemanticSTF**: A dataset collected under real-world adverse conditions, used for validating the model's performance.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
