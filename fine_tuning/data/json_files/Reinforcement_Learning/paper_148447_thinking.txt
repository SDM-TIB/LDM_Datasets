To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Measure Reinforcement Learning for Observation Cost Minimization" by Colin Bellinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets or environments that were utilized in the study.

In **Section 5.1 (RL Environments)**, the authors describe four environments used for evaluation:

1. **Chain Environment**: A chain of 11 states where the agent learns to navigate from the start state to the goal state. The environment is defined by specific rewards and costs associated with measuring the state.

2. **Frozen Lake 8 × 8 Environment**: A grid-based environment where the agent must navigate to a goal while avoiding holes. The authors specify the rewards and costs for measuring the state.

3. **Taxi Environment**: A city grid world where the agent picks up and drops off passengers. The environment includes defined rewards and costs for measuring the state.

4. **Junior Scientist Environment**: A novel environment designed to emulate a student learning to manipulate an energy source. The authors describe the rewards and costs associated with measuring the state.

After identifying these environments, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments that are based on existing works. However, in this case, the environments appear to be original implementations or adaptations rather than datasets that are cited from other sources.

Now, I will compile the information about each environment into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of the datasets:

- For the **Chain Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellinger, C., Coles, R., Crowley, M., & Tamblyn, I. (2023). *Active Measure Reinforcement Learning for Observation Cost Minimization*. Preprint. Under review.

- For the **Frozen Lake 8 × 8 Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellinger, C., Coles, R., Crowley, M., & Tamblyn, I. (2023). *Active Measure Reinforcement Learning for Observation Cost Minimization*. Preprint. Under review.

- For the **Taxi Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellinger, C., Coles, R., Crowley, M., & Tamblyn, I. (2023). *Active Measure Reinforcement Learning for Observation Cost Minimization*. Preprint. Under review.

- For the **Junior Scientist Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellinger, C., Coles, R., Crowley, M., & Tamblyn, I. (2023). *Active Measure Reinforcement Learning for Observation Cost Minimization*. Preprint. Under review.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each environment and its associated citation, ready for further processing or review.
