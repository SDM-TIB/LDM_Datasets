To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Optimal Portfolio Management Using Hierarchical Clustering" by Kapil Panda, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses portfolio optimization and mentions using a hierarchical clustering approach, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **Methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data Used**. Here, the author states that they used the monthly returns of common stocks listed on the three major U.S. stock exchanges: NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ, sourced from the Center of Research in Security Prices (CRSP) from 1965-2022. This indicates a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the author mentions obtaining monthly risk-free data from Ken Frenchâ€™s data library, which includes various market factors. This is another dataset that should be noted.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CRSP Data**: The citation for the CRSP data is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is a well-known dataset in financial research. I will note it as:
   > Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). *Monthly stock returns data from 1965-2022*. Available at: [CRSP website link].

2. **Ken French Data Library**: Similarly, the citation for the Ken French data library is also not explicitly mentioned, but it is a widely recognized source for financial data. I will note it as:
   > Ken French. *Data Library*. Available at: [Ken French Data Library link].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I have captured the essence of each dataset along with their respective citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
