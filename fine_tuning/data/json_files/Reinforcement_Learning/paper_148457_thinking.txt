To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Should artificial agents ask for help in human-robot collaborative problem-solving?" by Adrien Bennetot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets utilized. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Tower of Hanoi game** as a task for their learning agent. I will need to determine if this game is associated with a specific dataset or if it is a standard task in the field.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to data collection or specific datasets that were analyzed during the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets used for training or testing their algorithms, I will take note of them.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset. If the Tower of Hanoi game is a well-known task, I may not find a specific dataset citation, but I will still document it as part of the experimental setup.

If the paper references any other datasets or studies that provide data for the experiments, I will ensure to extract those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections for dataset mentions.
2. Focusing on the methodology for specific tasks and datasets used.
3. Checking the results for any data analysis references.
4. Consulting the references section for full citations of any identified datasets.
5. Compiling the information into a clear format for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
