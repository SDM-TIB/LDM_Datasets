To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Properties of Neural Network Representations in Reinforcement Learning" by Han Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and experimental setup in detail, which is likely to include specific datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any section that describes the experimental design, as it often contains crucial information about the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. For instance, if the authors refer to specific environments or tasks, I will note these as they may correspond to datasets or benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari 2600 games** as a benchmark, I will look for the original source or dataset citation related to these games. Similarly, if they refer to any specific datasets used for training reinforcement learning agents, I will ensure to document those citations accurately.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
