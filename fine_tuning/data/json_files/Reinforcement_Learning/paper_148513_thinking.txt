To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NROWAN-DQN: A Stable Noisy Network with Noise Reduction and Online Weight Adjustment for Exploration" by Shuai Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the experimental setup, including the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluated their algorithm in four standard domains: **Cartpole, Pong, MountainCar, and Acrobot**. These are environments from the OpenAI Gym, which suggests that they are using these environments as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific references to datasets or environments in the **experiments section**. The authors describe each environment in detail, including the observations and rewards associated with them. However, they do not provide formal dataset citations since these environments are widely recognized and part of the OpenAI Gym framework.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the OpenAI Gym in reference [24], which provides the necessary citation for the datasets used in their experiments. The citation is as follows:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets (environments) used in the experiments and their citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Cartpole**: An environment where the agent must balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Pong**: A classic arcade game where the agent controls a paddle to hit a ball.
3. **MountainCar**: An environment where the agent must build momentum to reach the top of a hill.
4. **Acrobot**: A two-link robot that must swing up to a certain height.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
