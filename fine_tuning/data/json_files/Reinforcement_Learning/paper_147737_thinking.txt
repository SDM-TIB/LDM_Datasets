To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Many-Goals Reinforcement Learning" by Vivek Veeriah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments with various Atari games, which suggests that they are using datasets related to these games. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **experiments** section, the authors detail their methodology and results. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note them down carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment** as a dataset, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the **abstract** and **introduction** for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Search for a **Datasets** section or relevant mentions in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections.
3. Document the datasets, including their names and descriptions.
4. Check the **References section** for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information for clarity and accessibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
