To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Free Neural Architecture Search via Recursive Label Calibration" by Zechun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses synthesizing data for neural architecture search (NAS) without original training data, which suggests that synthesized datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I will look for any specific datasets that were synthesized or referenced during the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors synthesized datasets for two main tasks: **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. They mention generating synthetic images for these datasets using a pre-trained model, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the synthesized datasets since they are generated by the authors' methods. However, I will include citations for the original datasets used for training the pre-trained models:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211â€“252.

Since the synthesized datasets are not traditional datasets with established citations, I will note that they are derived from the methods described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for the original datasets used in the synthesis process. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
