To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Service Selection Using Predictive Models and Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Cliff Laschet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS)** dataset, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used in the research. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly in subsection 2.1 (Data). Here, the authors provide detailed information about the NHHCS dataset, including its purpose, the number of patients involved (4683 home care patients), and the types of features included (demographics, financial information, diagnoses, and care services). This section confirms that the NHHCS dataset is the main dataset utilized for the predictive modeling and service selection process.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NHHCS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *NHHCS - National Home and Hospice Care Survey Homepage*, 2007. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhhcs/index.htm (accessed January 25, 2018).

Since the NHHCS dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
