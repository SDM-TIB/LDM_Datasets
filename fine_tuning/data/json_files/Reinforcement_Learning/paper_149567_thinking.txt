To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Criticality-Based Varying Step-Number Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning" by Yitzhak Spielberg and Amos Azaria, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for testing their algorithms. In this paper, the authors mention testing their algorithm in three different domains: **Atari Pong**, **Road-Tree**, and **Shooter environments**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments to determine if they are associated with any publicly available datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **Atari Pong environment** and the **Road-Tree environment** in detail. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets that are publicly available for these environments. Instead, they describe the environments as constructed for the purpose of their experiments. Therefore, I will note that these environments are custom-built for the study rather than derived from existing datasets.

For the **Shooter environment**, the authors also describe it in detail, but again, it appears to be a custom environment created for their experiments. 

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no publicly available datasets to cite from this paper. Instead, I will document the environments used in the experiments as they are integral to the research.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the environments used in the experiments:

1. **Atari Pong Environment**: A custom environment based on the classic game of Pong, used to evaluate the CVS algorithm.
2. **Road-Tree Environment**: A custom environment designed to test the CVS algorithm, featuring a tree-like structure with junctions and terminal states.
3. **Shooter Environment**: Another custom environment where an agent controls a gun to shoot at a moving target.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will note that the environments are proprietary to the research conducted by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize my findings without any JSON structure, focusing on the environments and their significance in the context of the research.
