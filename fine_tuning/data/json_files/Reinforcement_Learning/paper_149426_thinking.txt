To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite Horizon Q-Learning: Stability, Convergence, Simulations and an Application on Smart Grids" by Vivek VP and Dr. Shalabh Bhatnagar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and application sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions demonstrating the performance of the algorithm on a setting of random MDPs, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments on random MDPs with various combinations of parameters (N, |S|, |A|), but they do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they do provide performance metrics and comparisons against baseline algorithms, which may imply the use of synthetic datasets generated for the experiments.

In the **application section on Smart Grids**, the authors discuss the formulation of the problem as a finite horizon MDP and describe the parameters involved (demand, battery units, price, and renewable energy). While this section provides context for the application, it does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that the authors likely used synthetic data generated based on the described parameters for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format. Since there are no specific datasets to cite, I will note that the experiments were conducted using synthetic datasets based on the parameters outlined in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, emphasizing the lack of explicit dataset citations while noting the use of synthetic data for the experiments.
