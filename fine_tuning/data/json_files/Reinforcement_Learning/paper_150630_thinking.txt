To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe, Efficient, Comfort, and Energy-saving Automated Driving through Roundabout Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Henan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for automated driving, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various driving scenarios and the challenges faced in automated driving, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **methodology section**.

In the **methodology**, particularly in section II.A (System Architecture), the authors mention using the **highway-env** simulation platform. This indicates that the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment rather than on real-world datasets. I will need to note this as it is relevant to the dataset extraction.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any datasets or environments are referenced. The authors discuss the performance of different DRL algorithms but do not provide specific datasets used for training or testing. Instead, they focus on the simulation environment and the performance metrics derived from it.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather relies on a simulation environment (highway-env), I will need to provide the citation for this environment as it serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citation for the **highway-env** simulation platform. The citation is as follows:
> E. Leurent, “An Environment for Autonomous Driving Decision Making,” 2018. Available: https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env

In summary, the only dataset-like resource mentioned in this paper is the **highway-env** simulation platform, which is used for training and testing the DRL algorithms. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After this analysis, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **highway-env** simulation environment, ensuring to include the full citation for proper referencing.
