To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experience Replay with Likelihood-free Importance Weights" by Samarth Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on a suite of OpenAI gym tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on various Mujoco continuous control tasks, specifically naming the environments used: **HalfCheetah-v2, Walker2d-v2, Ant-v2, Hopper-v2, and Humanoid-v2**. 

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The Mujoco environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, and I will look for the appropriate citation for the OpenAI Gym itself, as it encompasses these tasks.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **HalfCheetah-v2**: A continuous control task in the Mujoco simulator.
2. **Walker2d-v2**: Another continuous control task in the Mujoco simulator.
3. **Ant-v2**: A continuous control task in the Mujoco simulator.
4. **Hopper-v2**: A continuous control task in the Mujoco simulator.
5. **Humanoid-v2**: A continuous control task in the Mujoco simulator.

Since all these tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will use the same citation for each of them.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately noted down the datasets and their citations, ready to format them according to the required structure for further processing or review.
