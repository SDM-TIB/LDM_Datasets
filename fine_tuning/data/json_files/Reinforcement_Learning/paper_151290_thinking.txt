To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Large Language Models Play Games? A Case Study of A Self-Play Approach" by Hongyi Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for games, but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments in three scenarios: chess puzzles, MiniGo, and full chess games. I will look for any specific datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 6.1 (Chess Puzzle), the authors mention that they collected chess puzzles from lichess.org, specifically puzzles with themes related to checkmate sequences. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from lichess.

In Section 6.2 (MiniGo), the authors do not specify a dataset but mention using a 5x5 Go board for their experiments. This suggests that the dataset is likely generated from the game itself rather than a pre-existing dataset.

In Section 6.3 (Chess: Full Game), the authors mention evaluating their method against the Stockfish engine but do not specify a dataset for the chess games played. However, they do reference the use of a hybrid value function proxy that combines rule-based evaluations with LLM evaluations.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets identified:

1. **Chess Puzzles Dataset**: This dataset is derived from lichess.org, specifically focusing on chess puzzles with various themes related to checkmate sequences. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but it can be referenced as follows:
   > Lichess.org. *Lichess Chess Puzzles*. Available at: https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles.

2. **MiniGo Dataset**: The authors do not specify a formal dataset for the MiniGo experiments, as they are likely using a generated dataset based on the game rules and scenarios. Therefore, no citation is available.

3. **Chess Games Dataset**: Similar to the MiniGo dataset, the authors do not provide a specific dataset for the chess games played against the Stockfish engine. The games are likely generated during the experiments without a formal dataset citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have the correct citations for the datasets that were explicitly mentioned. The only formal dataset citation I can provide is for the chess puzzles from lichess.org.

In conclusion, I will document the datasets as follows:
- Chess Puzzles Dataset: Lichess.org. *Lichess Chess Puzzles*. Available at: https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles.
- MiniGo Dataset: No formal citation available.
- Chess Games Dataset: No formal citation available.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for any datasets and documented them appropriately.
