To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kalman meets Bellman: Improving Policy Evaluation through Value Tracking" by Shirli Di-Castro Shashua and Shie Mannor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Kalman-based frameworks for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if any datasets are described in the context of the experiments conducted. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. 

In the experiments section, I will look for any references to specific datasets, such as benchmarks or environments used for testing the proposed method. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets like "Mujoco" or "OpenAI Gym," I will ensure to find the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets. For example, Mujoco is often referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I will look for its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
