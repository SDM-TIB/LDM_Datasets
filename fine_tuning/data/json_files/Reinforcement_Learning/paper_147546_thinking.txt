To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Reinforcement Learningâ€™s Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear" by Zachary C. Lipton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of intrinsic fear in reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects and applications of deep reinforcement learning without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. Here, they mention several environments, which may include datasets or benchmarks:

1. **Adventure Seeker**: A toy pathological environment designed to demonstrate catastrophic forgetting.
2. **Cart-Pole**: A classic reinforcement learning environment.
3. **Atari games**: Specifically, they mention **Seaquest**, **Asteroids**, and **Freeway**.

In this section, the authors do not provide specific dataset names but refer to environments that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. I will need to look for full citations for these environments in the references section.

In the **references section**, I will check for any papers that describe these environments in detail. For example, the Atari games are often associated with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The reference for this is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 2013.

For **Cart-Pole**, it is a standard environment in the OpenAI Gym, which is also referenced in the paper:

- **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI gym*. arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540, 2016.

The **Adventure Seeker** environment appears to be a custom environment created by the authors, and it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note it as a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets and environments mentioned in the paper. 

The final entries will include:
1. Adventure Seeker (custom environment, no citation).
2. Cart-Pole (OpenAI Gym).
3. Atari games (Arcade Learning Environment).

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and cited the datasets used in the research paper, adhering to the importance of full citations for each dataset.
