To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kalman Filtering with Adversarial Corruptions" by Sitan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. This can provide additional context about the datasets and their significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research or verification.

For each dataset, I will document the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Citation**: The full citation as provided in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its details and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be useful for future research or inquiries into the study.
