To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaDDA: Strategies for Adjusting the Playing Strength of a Fully Trained AlphaZero System to a Suitable Human Training Partner" by Kazuhisa Fujita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experimental settings section** (section 4) closely, as this section typically details the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the author mentions that AlphaDDA plays three games: **Connect4, 6x6 Othello, and Othello**. However, I need to determine if there are specific datasets associated with these games.

In the **games subsection (4.1)**, the author describes the games but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will also check the **opponents subsection (4.2)** to see if any datasets are referenced in relation to the AI opponents used for evaluation.

Since the paper does not seem to provide specific datasets or their citations, I will look for any references in the **References section** that might indicate where the datasets or game implementations can be found. The references may include papers or resources that describe the datasets used for training or evaluation in the context of the games mentioned.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their names and full citations. If the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for any datasets or resources mentioned in the paper, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experimental settings section for details on datasets used in the experiments.
3. Check the references for any citations related to datasets or game implementations.
4. Compile the dataset information and ensure proper citations are included.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper accurately.
