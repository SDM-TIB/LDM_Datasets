To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coordinated Proximal Policy Optimization" by Zifan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4 in this paper) in detail. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, as they may provide detailed descriptions, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** as a benchmark for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. For example, the SMAC dataset is referenced in the context of previous works, and I will ensure to capture the correct citation format.

For the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, the citation is:
> Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems, pages 2186â€“2188, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
