To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Two-Dimensional to Three-Dimensional Environment with Q-Learning: Modeling Autonomous Navigation with Reinforcement Learning and no Libraries" by Ergon Cugler de Moraes Silva, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the performance of reinforcement learning agents in 2D and 3D environments. While this section outlines the research focus, it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods section**. Here, the author describes the implementation of the Q-learning agent and the environment classes for both 2D and 3D scenarios. The parameters for these environments are detailed, but again, there is no mention of external datasets being used. Instead, the environments are defined by the author, indicating that the study is based on simulations rather than pre-existing datasets.

In the **results section**, the author presents findings from the experiments conducted in both environments. The performance metrics and learning trajectories are discussed, but there is still no reference to any external datasets. The author emphasizes the design of the environments and the training of the agents without relying on pre-made libraries or datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research. The environments and parameters described are original contributions of the author rather than data derived from existing datasets.

Finally, I will ensure to check the **references section** for any citations that might relate to datasets, but given the context of the paper, it appears to focus on the author's own experimental setups rather than established datasets.

In summary, this paper does not provide any datasets that can be cited, as it primarily discusses the author's own simulations and methodologies for reinforcement learning in 2D and 3D environments. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper.
