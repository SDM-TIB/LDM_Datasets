To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Driving Style Alignment for LLM-powered Driver Agent" by Ruoxuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors through experiments and interviews, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their data collection process in **Section III (Driving Style Data Collection)**. Here, they detail how they conducted a natural driving experiment with 24 drivers and followed it up with post-driving interviews to gather decision-making data. This section confirms the existence of a dataset based on human driving behaviors.

I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Driving Thinking Dataset**: This dataset consists of structured human drivers' decision-making data collected from a natural driving experiment and subsequent interviews. It captures various driving styles and articulates the decision-making process in a natural language format.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset can be found at a specific link, which is:
- Driving Thinking Dataset: [https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Driving-Thinking-Dataset](https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Driving-Thinking-Dataset)

Since the dataset is hosted on a GitHub repository, I will treat this as the citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation and any relevant details about the dataset's content and purpose. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
