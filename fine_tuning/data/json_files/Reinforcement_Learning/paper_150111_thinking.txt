To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Outlier-Insensitive Kalman Filtering Using NUV Priors" by Shunit Truzman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention testing their algorithms on a standard localization task and specifically refer to the **Michigan NCLT dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being used for evaluation.

In this section, the authors describe the NCLT dataset as containing noisy GPS readings and the corresponding ground truth location of a moving Segway robot. This provides enough detail to understand the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Michigan NCLT dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **Michigan NCLT dataset**:
  > N. Carlevaris-Bianco, A. K. Ushani, and R. M. Eustice. *University of Michigan North Campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 35, no. 9, 2016.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Michigan NCLT dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
