To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CORE: A Retrieve-then-Edit Framework for Counterfactual Data Generation" by Tanay Dixit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses counterfactual data augmentation and mentions experiments on natural language inference and sentiment analysis benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail.

In **section 4.1 (Sentiment Classification)**, the authors mention the **IMDb movie review dataset**. They provide context about its use in generating counterfactuals and reference a prior work that augmented this dataset with human-edited counterfactuals. The citation for the IMDb dataset is:
> Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, 2011.

In the same section, they also mention using the **Amazon Movie reviews dataset** and the **Yelp reviews dataset**. The citations for these datasets are:
> Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: Understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys ’13, pages 165–172, 2013.
> Nabiha Asghar. *Yelp dataset challenge: Review rating prediction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.05362, 2016.

Moving on to **section 4.2 (Natural Language Inference)**, the authors discuss the **MNLI dataset**. They provide details about how they used it for their experiments. The citation for the MNLI dataset is:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper.
