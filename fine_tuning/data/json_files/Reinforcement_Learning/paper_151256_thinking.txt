To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Radiance Fields for Edge Video Compression and Metaverse Integration in Autonomous Driving" by Eugen Å lapak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on a dataset of camera images from the CARLA simulator, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that a training dataset for the RFs was compiled by rendering a specified urban 3D scene using the CARLA simulation software. They detail that 18 cameras were attached to a car driving in both directions of the street, capturing images for the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the CARLA simulator in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset. The CARLA simulator is a well-known open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, and its citation is typically included in related works.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Dataset Name**: CARLA Simulator Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of camera images rendered from a 3D urban environment using the CARLA simulator, captured by 18 cameras attached to a car driving in both directions of the street.
   - **Full Citation**: Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or structuring as needed.
