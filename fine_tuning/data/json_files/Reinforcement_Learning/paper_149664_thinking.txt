To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Reinforcement Learning for Radio" by Jianyu Zhao and Chenyang Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks they are used for.

If the datasets are not mentioned in the experiments section, I will check the **related works section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in previous studies that are relevant to their work. This could provide context or lead to datasets that are indirectly related to the current research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" for their experiments, I will document it as follows:

1. **XYZ Dataset**: A dataset containing [description of the dataset, e.g., number of samples, types of data, etc.]. This dataset is used for [specific tasks or evaluations].

Then, I will find the citation for the XYZ Dataset in the References section, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. [Link or DOI if available].

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, making it easier for others to understand and access the data.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
