To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Which Style Makes Me Attractive? Interpretable Control Exploration and Counterfactual Explanation by StyleGAN" by Bo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup and the datasets used. This section typically contains the most explicit references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for training a face attribute classifier. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific attributes it contains.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation is crucial for proper documentation and should include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the CelebA dataset is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
