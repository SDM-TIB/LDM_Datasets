To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning by Planning" by Qihan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup and the datasets used for benchmarking their proposed MAZero algorithm. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the experiments section, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** environments. This indicates that SMAC is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SMAC dataset. The citation for the SMAC benchmark is typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

The full citation for the SMAC benchmark is:
> Ryan Lowe, Yi I Wu, Aviv Tamar, Jean Harb, OpenAI Pieter Abbeel, and Igor Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, 2017.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics based on the information provided in the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is clear and concise for future reference.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed information about datasets used.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references section.
4. Summarize the dataset's characteristics and compile the information for documentation.
