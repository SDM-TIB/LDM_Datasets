To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DynamicLight: Two-Stage Dynamic Traffic Signal Timing" by Liang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using both real-world and synthetic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they explicitly mention that they utilized both real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the effectiveness of the DynamicLight framework.

1. **Real-world datasets**: The authors specify that they used seven traffic flow datasets from different locations:
   - **Jinan (JN)**: Three datasets labeled as JN1, JN2, and JN3.
   - **Hangzhou (HZ)**: Two datasets labeled as HZ1 and HZ2.
   - **New York (NY)**: Two datasets labeled as NY1 and NY2.

2. **Synthetic datasets**: The authors also mention six synthetic traffic flow datasets for three distinct intersection topologies, labeled as SYN1-1, SYN1-2, SYN2-1, SYN2-2, SYN3-1, and SYN3-2.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are described as being collected from specific locations (Jinan, Hangzhou, New York) and are not attributed to specific papers, I will note that the citations for these datasets may not be available in the traditional sense. Instead, I will document the datasets as described in the paper.

Hereâ€™s how I will summarize the datasets:

- **Real-world Datasets**:
  - **Jinan Datasets**: JN1, JN2, JN3 (specific citations not provided).
  - **Hangzhou Datasets**: HZ1, HZ2 (specific citations not provided).
  - **New York Datasets**: NY1, NY2 (specific citations not provided).

- **Synthetic Datasets**:
  - **SYN1-1, SYN1-2, SYN2-1, SYN2-2, SYN3-1, SYN3-2** (specific citations not provided).

Since the paper does not provide detailed citations for these datasets, I will note that they are derived from the authors' experiments and are not attributed to external sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the datasets as they are described in the context of the paper.
