To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Aware High-level Decisions for Automated Driving at Occluded Intersections with Reinforcement Learning" by Danial Kamran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a risk-aware DQN approach for automated driving, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **Carla simulator** for training their reinforcement learning model. This indicates that the dataset is generated from a simulation environment rather than a traditional dataset.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. The authors cite several works, but they do not specify datasets that they used in their own experiments.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather relies on a simulation environment, I will note that the Carla simulator is the primary source of data for their experiments. 

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find any relevant citations related to the Carla simulator. The citation for the Carla simulator is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the Carla simulator is the only dataset relevant to the experiments conducted in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Carla simulator as the dataset used in the study.
