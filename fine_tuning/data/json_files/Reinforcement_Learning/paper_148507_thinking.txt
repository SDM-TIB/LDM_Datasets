To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Tactical Decision-Making in Intersections" by Carl-Johan Hoel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a Bayesian reinforcement learning method for tactical decision-making in intersections, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section III (Implementation)**, which describes the simulation setup. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and testing the reinforcement learning agent. I will look for any references to specific datasets or simulation environments that were utilized in the experiments.

In **section III-A (Simulation setup)**, the authors mention that the simulated environment is based on a previous study. This indicates that there may be a dataset or simulation framework referenced in the cited work. I will need to check the references to identify the original source of the simulation data.

I will also check **section IV (Results)** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for evaluation or testing the performance of their method. If they mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will take note of them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or simulation environments mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for the datasets used in the research.

If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets as well. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
