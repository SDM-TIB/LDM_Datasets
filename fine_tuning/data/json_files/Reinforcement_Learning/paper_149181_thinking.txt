To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Coordination Offsets for Signalized Arterial Intersections using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Keith Anshilo Diaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a validated and calibrated traffic model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to traffic measurements or simulations. The introduction discusses the need for traffic management systems and mentions the use of a traffic model, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **methodology** where the authors might describe the data used for their experiments. In this paper, the methodology section discusses the traffic model and the parameters used for the simulations, which may include datasets related to traffic flow and occupancy measurements.

In the **Methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets or sources of data. The authors mention using a traffic model developed in the Connected Corridors I-210 Pilot, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this model, including its calibration and validation against field data.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide insights into the data collection process. They mention using sensor measurements collected over a 4-hour simulation period, which indicates that there are specific datasets related to traffic conditions during different times of the day.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. I will look for any papers or reports that describe the traffic model or datasets used in their study. 

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Connected Corridors I-210 Pilot Traffic Model**: This dataset includes traffic measurements validated and calibrated with field detectors and signal phasing data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Q. Gan and A. Skabardonis. *Arterial Traffic Estimation Using Field Detector and Signal Phasing Data*. University of California Institute of Transportation Studies, 2019.

2. **Field Sensor Measurements**: The authors mention using sensor measurements collected during the simulation. While they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is likely derived from the same traffic model mentioned above.

After gathering all relevant information and citations, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for inclusion in the structured output format.
