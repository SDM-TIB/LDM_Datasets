To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IPPO: Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Manipulators in Joint Space via Improved Proximal Policy Optimization" by Yongliang Wang and Hamidreza Kasaei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any mentions of simulation environments or datasets that were utilized in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **Gazebo** and **Pybullet** as simulation environments for training and testing their model. However, I need to determine if they refer to any specific datasets or configurations within these environments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the training process and the environments used, but they do not explicitly mention any named datasets. Instead, they discuss the setup of the environments and the parameters used for training. This indicates that the datasets may be implicit within the simulation environments rather than being standalone datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the context of the experiments. However, the paper primarily discusses the simulation environments and does not reference any specific datasets from external sources.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the environments used for training and testing:

1. **Gazebo**: A simulation environment used for training the model and evaluating its performance in a real-robot setup.
2. **Pybullet**: Another simulation environment used for initial training before transferring the model to Gazebo.

While these environments are crucial for the experiments, they do not correspond to traditional datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will note that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets in their experiments, but rather relied on simulation environments for their training and evaluation.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting the absence of specific datasets while highlighting the simulation environments used in the research.
