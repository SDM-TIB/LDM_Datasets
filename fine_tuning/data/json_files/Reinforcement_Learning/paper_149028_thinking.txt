To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Anti-jamming Power Allocation in a Two-cell NOMA Network" by Sina Yousefzadeh Marandy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of NOMA systems under jamming conditions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In this section, they might provide details about the data they used to validate their proposed methods.

I will also review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if the authors refer to existing datasets used in their experiments. This could provide valuable information about the datasets they relied on.

After thoroughly examining these sections, I will compile a list of datasets, if any are identified. If the authors used specific datasets for their simulations, I will note their names and any relevant details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If I find datasets, I will document them along with their full citations, ensuring that I follow the proper format for each citation as presented in the references section of the paper. If no datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets referenced in the paper.
