To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Based Local Path Planning for Mobile Robot" by Mehmet GÃ¶k et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses various path planning methods but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. In this section, the authors may describe the environments or datasets used for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or related works that include datasets. This could provide additional context or direct citations for datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **TurtleBot3** platform for their experiments, which implies that they may have used simulation environments or datasets associated with this platform. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset names or detailed descriptions.

Since the paper lacks explicit dataset citations, I will look for any references to external datasets or simulation environments in the references section. I will note any relevant citations that could be associated with datasets used in the context of mobile robot path planning.

After gathering all the information, I will compile the findings and ensure that I provide full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. If no specific datasets are identified, I will document that as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation, even if it is indirectly referenced through related works or simulation environments.
