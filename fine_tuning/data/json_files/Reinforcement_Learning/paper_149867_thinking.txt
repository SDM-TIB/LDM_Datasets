To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Exact Combinatorial Optimization: Learning to Branch" by Tianyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of the proposed method on "four different categories of combinatorial optimization problems," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for testing their framework. They specifically mention four types of NP-hard problems, which are likely associated with datasets:

1. **Set Covering Problem**: The authors state that their instances contain 1,000 columns and 500 rows per instance. This indicates a specific dataset structure for this problem.

2. **Combinatorial Auction Problem**: They mention generating instances with 100 items for 500 bids, which also suggests a defined dataset.

3. **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**: Although the authors do not provide specific details about the dataset in this section, it is implied that there is a dataset associated with this problem.

4. **Maximum Independent Set Problem**: The authors refer to a dataset proposed in a previous work, indicating that it has specific parameters (affinity set to 4, graph size set to 500).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For the **Set Covering Problem**, the citation is:
  > Egon Balas and Andrew Ho. *Set covering algorithms using cutting planes, heuristics, and subgradient optimization: a computational study*. In Combinatorial Optimization, pages 37–60. Springer, 1980.

- For the **Combinatorial Auction Problem**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Leyton-Brown, Mark Pearson, and Yoav Shoham. *Towards a universal test suite for combinatorial auction algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 2nd ACM conference on Electronic commerce, pages 66–76, 2000.

- For the **Capacitated Facility Location Problem**, the citation is:

- For the **Maximum Independent Set Problem**, the citation is:
  > David Bergman, Andre A Cire, Willem-Jan Van Hoeve, and John Hooker. *Decision diagrams for optimization, volume 1*. Springer, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
