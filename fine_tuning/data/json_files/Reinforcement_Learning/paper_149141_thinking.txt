To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GDI: Rethinking What Makes Reinforcement Learning Different from Supervised Learning" by Jiajun Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical experiments on the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their evaluations.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** for any specific datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe their experiments in detail, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks. In this section, they refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as the primary dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results based on their evaluations on ALE. They mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on various Atari games, which are part of the ALE dataset. This confirms that ALE is indeed the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment dataset. The citation for ALE is as follows:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset entry for the Arcade Learning Environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
