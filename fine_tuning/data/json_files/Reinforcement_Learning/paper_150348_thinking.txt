To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dropout Injection at Test Time for Post Hoc Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Networks" by Emanuele Ledda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions "experimental results on UCI datasets and crowd counting benchmarks," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention two groups of experiments: one on UCI datasets and another on crowd counting datasets. 

1. **UCI Datasets**: The authors specify that they used eight datasets related to multivariate regression problems, which include:
   - **Protein-Tertiary-Structure**
   - **Boston-Housing**
   - **Concrete**
   - **Energy**
   - **Kin8nm**
   - **Power-Plant**
   - **Wine-Quality-Red**
   - **Yacht**

2. **Crowd Counting Datasets**: The authors also mention three benchmark datasets for crowd counting:
   - **UCSD**
   - **Mall**
   - **PETS** (with three different partitions: PETSview1, PETSview2, and PETSview3)

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The UCI datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for their standard citations. The crowd counting datasets also have established references.

For the UCI datasets, the citations are generally as follows:
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: 
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml)

For the crowd counting datasets, the citations are:
- **UCSD Dataset**:
  > Chan, A. B., Liang, Z. J., & Vasconcelos, N. (2008). Privacy preserving crowd monitoring: Counting people without people models or tracking. In 2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 24-26 June 2008, Anchorage, Alaska, USA. doi:10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587569.

- **Mall Dataset**:
  > Chen, K., Loy, C. C., Gong, S., & Xiang, T. (2012). Feature mining for localized crowd counting. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2012. doi:10.5244/C.26.21.

- **PETS Dataset**:
  > Ferryman, J. M., & Shahrokni, A. (2009). PETS2009: Dataset and challenge. In 2009 Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance (2009), 1-6.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
