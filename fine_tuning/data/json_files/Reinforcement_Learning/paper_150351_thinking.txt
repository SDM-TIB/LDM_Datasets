To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Control in Intelligent Transportation Systems" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for traffic light control, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the algorithms. In this paper, the authors mention using numerical experiments to validate their methods, but I need to find explicit dataset names.

I will also check the **related works section** for any references to datasets that might have been used in previous studies, as this could provide context or lead to datasets that the authors might have used indirectly.

After thoroughly reviewing these sections, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results section**. If the authors have conducted experiments, they might have referenced specific datasets used for those experiments.

Once I identify any datasets, I will then consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the data sources used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset like the "Open Traffic Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Smith, J., & Doe, A. (2020). *Open Traffic Dataset: A Comprehensive Resource for Traffic Analysis*. Journal of Transportation Research, 45(3), 123-145.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that I have accurately represented the sources as per the requirements.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper and provide complete citations for each one.
