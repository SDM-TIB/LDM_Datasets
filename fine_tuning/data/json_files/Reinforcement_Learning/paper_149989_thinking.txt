To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ad Hoc Teamwork in the Presence of Adversaries" by Ted Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the potential of ad hoc teamwork in real-world applications but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about ad hoc teamwork but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **evaluation** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors discuss various methods and challenges related to ad hoc teamwork but do not specify any datasets directly.

I will then look at the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The paper cites several studies related to adversarial reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems, but it does not appear to provide specific datasets used in their research.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. However, I will ensure to document the references that may contain relevant datasets for future research.

Finally, I will compile the citations of the referenced works that might be useful for understanding the context of ad hoc teamwork and adversarial machine learning:

1. **Adversarial RL Research**:
   - Huang, S., Papernot, N., Goodfellow, I., Duan, Y., and Abbeel, P. "Adversarial attacks on neural network policies." arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.02284, 2017.

2. **Cooperative AI**:
   - Dafoe, A., Hughes, E., Bachrach, Y., Collins, T., McKee, K. R., Leibo, J. Z., Larson, K., and Graepel, T. "Open problems in cooperative AI." arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.08630, 2020.

3. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Lowe, R., Wu, Y. I., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Pieter Abbeel, O., and Mordatch, I. "Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments." Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, 2017.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that the extraction process yielded no dataset entries. However, I will keep the references noted for potential future exploration of datasets related to the topics discussed in the paper.
