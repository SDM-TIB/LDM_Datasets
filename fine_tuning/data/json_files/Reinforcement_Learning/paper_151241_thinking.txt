To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Critical Evaluation of AI Feedback for Aligning Large Language Models" by Archit Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and mentions datasets like ShareGPT, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors reference the ShareGPT dataset constructed using GPT-3.5 completions. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors detail their experimental setup and mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically state that they use the ShareGPT dataset for their experiments. I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in this section or in the related work.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets:

1. **ShareGPT Dataset**: This dataset is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and is constructed using completions from the GPT-3.5 model. It consists of single-turn conversations and is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShareGPT dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For **ShareGPT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chiang, W.-L., Li, Z., Lin, Z., Sheng, Y., Wu, Z., Zhang, H., Zheng, L., Zhuang, S., Zhuang, Y., Gonzalez, J. E., et al. *Vicuna: An open-source chatbot impressing GPT-4 with 90%* ChatGPT quality. See https://vicuna.lmsys.org (accessed 14 April 2023), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
