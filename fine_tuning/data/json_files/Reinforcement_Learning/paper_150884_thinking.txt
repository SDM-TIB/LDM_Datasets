To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activate and Reject: Towards Safe Domain Generalization under Category Shift" by Chaoqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of domain generalization under category shifts, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on four standard domain generalization benchmarks:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,991 images across seven object classes from four domains: Photo, Art Painting, Cartoon, and Sketch. The authors specify that four classes (dog, elephant, giraffe, and guitar) are used as known classes, while the remaining three classes are treated as unknown.

2. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15,500 images across 65 classes from four domains: Artistic, Clipart, Product, and Real World. The first 15 classes are selected as known classes, and the remaining 50 classes are treated as unknown.

3. **Office-31 Dataset**: This dataset includes 31 classes collected from three domains: Amazon, DSLR, and Webcam. The authors mention that the 10 classes shared with Caltech-256 are used as known classes, while the last 11 classes are treated as unknown.

4. **Digits Dataset**: This dataset comprises four handwritten digit domains, including MNIST, MNIST-M, SVHN, and USPS. MNIST is used as the source domain, and the other datasets are treated as target domains. The known classes include numbers from 0 to 4.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

  > LeCun, Yann, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
