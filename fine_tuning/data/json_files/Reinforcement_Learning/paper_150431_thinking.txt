To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Strategic Value and Cooperation in Multi-Player Stochastic Games through Side Payments" by Alan Kuhnle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "empirical validation is performed on stochastic grid-games," which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical evaluation section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using "a standard test suite of grid games generalized to more than two players." This indicates that there are specific datasets or game environments used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or game environments. The authors reference various works, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the empirical evaluation section, I find that the authors describe several grid games, including "Prisoners," "Friend-or-Foe," "Coordination," and "Turkey." However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these games. Instead, they refer to these games as standard test cases in the literature.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, I will note that the datasets are derived from established game environments in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning. I will compile the following entries based on the games mentioned:

1. **Grid Games Test Suite**: A collection of grid-based games used for empirical validation in multi-agent settings. The specific games include:
   - Prisoners
   - Friend-or-Foe
   - Coordination
   - Turkey

For the citation, I will reference the paper itself as it serves as the source for the datasets used in the experiments:

Now, I will prepare to format these findings into the required structured output, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the full citation as specified.
