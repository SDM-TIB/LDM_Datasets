To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PPO-UE: Proximal Policy Optimization via Uncertainty-Aware Exploration" by Qisheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed PPO-UE algorithm on Roboschool continuous control tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in these experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find specific details about the datasets used. The paper mentions that the experiments were conducted in the **RoboschoolWalker2d** environment, which is part of the OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the dataset or environment used for training and testing is the Roboschool environment.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Roboschool environment. The relevant citation for the Roboschool environment is:

- For **Roboschool**:
  > Brockman, G.; Cheung, V.; Pettersson, L.; Schneider, J.; Schulman, J.; Tang, J.; and Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets beyond the Roboschool environment, I will conclude my extraction here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Roboschool environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
