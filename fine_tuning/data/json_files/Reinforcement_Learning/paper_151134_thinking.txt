To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAPO: Advancing Multilingual Reasoning through Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization" by Shuaijie She et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on three benchmarks: **MSVAMP, MGSM, and MNumGLUESub**. This indicates that these are likely the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a table that summarizes the statistics of the three benchmarks, including the number of samples and whether they are in-domain or out-of-domain datasets. The details are as follows:

1. **MSVAMP**: Out-of-domain dataset with 10,000 samples.
2. **MGSM**: In-domain dataset with 2,500 samples.
3. **MNumGLUESub**: In-domain dataset with 5,530 samples.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MSVAMP**, the citation is:
  > Nuo Chen, Zinan Zheng, Ning Wu, Linjun Shou, Ming Gong, Yangqiu Song, Dongmei Zhang, and Jia Li. *Breaking language barriers in multilingual mathematical reasoning: Insights and observations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.20246, 2023.

- For **MGSM**, the citation is:
  > Freda Shi, Mirac Suzgun, Markus Freitag, Xuezhi Wang, Suraj Srivats, Soroush Vosoughi, Hyung Won Chung, Yi Tay, Sebastian Ruder, Denny Zhou, Dipanjan Das, and Jason Wei. *Language models are multilingual chain-of-thought reasoners*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.11171, 2022.

- For **MNumGLUESub**, the citation is:
  > Ashwin Kalyan. *Numglue: A suite of fundamental yet challenging mathematical reasoning tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.05660, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
