To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P-TA: Using Proximal Policy Optimization to Enhance Tabular Data Augmentation via Large Language Models" by Shuo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Travel Customers Dataset**: This dataset is aimed at predicting customer churn for a travel company.
2. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset consists of records from the 1994 Census database, used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K.
3. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains information about home equity line of credit applications, used to assess risk performance.

In this section, the authors provide links to where these datasets can be accessed, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Travel Customers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tejashvi, A. (2023). *Travel Customers Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/tour-travels-customer-churn-prediction

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru, D. & Karra Taniskidou. (2017). *UCI Adult Income Dataset*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

- For the **HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Averkiy, O. (2023). *Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Dataset*. Retrieved from https://kaggle.com/datasets/averkiyoliabev/home-equity-line-of-creditheloc

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
