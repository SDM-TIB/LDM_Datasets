To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Opponent Policy Detection in Multi-Agent MDPs: Real-Time Strategy Switch Identification Using Running Error Estimation" by Mohidul Haque Mridul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **Section 4 (Empirical Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in a **Predator-Prey grid-world environment**. They mention using a **10 × 10 grid-world** created using the OpenAI Gym library, which serves as the environment for their experiments. This indicates that the grid-world setup itself is a dataset of sorts, but I need to confirm if there are any other datasets mentioned.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or libraries mentioned. In this case, the OpenAI Gym library is referenced, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym library is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." CoRR abs/1606.01540 (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540

Additionally, I will note that the paper does not mention any other specific datasets beyond the grid-world environment, which is a common setup in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets identified.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Predator-Prey Grid-World Environment**: A 10 × 10 grid-world created using the OpenAI Gym library for testing the proposed algorithm.

The full citation for the OpenAI Gym library is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. "OpenAI Gym." CoRR abs/1606.01540 (2016). https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries according to the specified requirements.
