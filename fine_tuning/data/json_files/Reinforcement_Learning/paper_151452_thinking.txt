To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Ground Delay Program Revision and Corresponding Flight Delay Assignments" by Ke Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on optimizing Ground Delay Programs (GDP) using Reinforcement Learning, but it does not specify datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section II (Experiment Setup)**, particularly the **Data Sources and Feature Extraction subsection**. Here, the authors list three datasets used in their study:

1. **ASPM Flight Level Data**: This dataset includes records from various types of flights at 77 major U.S. airports, detailing scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, as well as delays.

2. **ASPM Airport Quarter Hour Data**: This dataset provides operational and meteorological data recorded every 15 minutes at the top 77 commercial airports, including metrics like acceptance rates and weather conditions.

3. **ATCSCC GDP Advisory Database**: This dataset captures all Ground Delay Programs issued within the National Airspace System in 2019, detailing essential information such as the targeted airport, time of issuance, duration, reasons for the GDP, program rates, and affected scopes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, it is important to note that the datasets may not have formal citations like traditional research articles. Instead, I will summarize the information provided in the paper regarding each dataset.

For the **ASPM Flight Level Data**, the citation is typically attributed to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as it is a government dataset. I will note that it is publicly available through the FAA's ASPM database.

For the **ASPM Airport Quarter Hour Data**, similar to the Flight Level Data, this dataset is also maintained by the FAA and can be referenced as such.

For the **ATCSCC GDP Advisory Database**, this dataset is also managed by the FAA and can be cited accordingly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations as described above.

1. **ASPM Flight Level Data**: 
   - Description: Records from commercial, general aviation, air taxi, and military flights at 77 major U.S. airports, including scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, as well as delays.
   - Citation: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). *ASPM Flight Level Data*. Available at: [FAA ASPM Database](https://aspm.faa.gov).

2. **ASPM Airport Quarter Hour Data**: 
   - Description: Operational and meteorological data recorded every 15 minutes at the top 77 commercial airports, including metrics such as acceptance rates and weather conditions.
   - Citation: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). *ASPM Airport Quarter Hour Data*. Available at: [FAA ASPM Database](https://aspm.faa.gov).

3. **ATCSCC GDP Advisory Database**: 
   - Description: Captures all Ground Delay Programs issued within the National Airspace System in 2019, detailing essential information such as the targeted airport, time of issuance, duration, reasons for the GDP, program rates, and affected scopes.
   - Citation: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). *ATCSCC GDP Advisory Database*. Available at: [FAA ATCSCC Database](https://aspm.faa.gov).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
