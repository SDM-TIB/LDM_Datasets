To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CREATED: Generating Viable Counterfactual Sequences for Predictive Process Analytics" by Olusanmi Hundogan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of event logs from real-life processes for their experiments. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their evaluation. They mention ten event logs from three real-life processes and provide a table (Table 2) with detailed statistics about each dataset. The datasets listed include:

1. **DiCE4EL**: This dataset consists of 3,051 cases and is used for qualitative evaluation.
2. **BPIC12-25**: Contains 4,587 cases, with a minimum length of 12 and a maximum length of 25.
3. **BPIC12-50**: Contains 4,677 cases, with a minimum length of 12 and a maximum length of 50.
4. **BPIC12-75**: Contains 4,685 cases, with a minimum length of 12 and a maximum length of 75.
5. **BPIC12-100**: Contains 4,707 cases, with a minimum length of 12 and a maximum length of 100.
6. **Sepsis-25**: Contains 707 cases, with a minimum length of 5 and a maximum length of 25.
7. **Sepsis-50**: Contains 770 cases, with a minimum length of 5 and a maximum length of 50.
8. **Sepsis-75**: Contains 777 cases, with a minimum length of 5 and a maximum length of 75.
9. **Sepsis-100**: Contains 779 cases, with a minimum length of 5 and a maximum length of 100.
10. **TrafficFines**: Contains 129 cases, with a minimum length of 2 and a maximum length of 12.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer that the datasets are likely referenced in the context of previous works or benchmarks.

For example, the **DiCE4EL** dataset is likely referenced in the context of the work by Hsieh et al. (2021), which is mentioned in the paper. Similarly, the **BPIC datasets** are often used in process mining literature, and their original sources can be traced back to the BPM conference proceedings.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset based on the context provided in the paper and relevant literature.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections to identify datasets.
2. Listing the datasets mentioned in the evaluation section.
3. Searching for full citations in the references or related works.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations for further processing.
