To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased Methods for Multi-Goal RL" by LÃ©onard Blier and Yann Ollivier, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to experiments that involve datasets.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." In this paper, I will specifically check for a section that discusses the datasets used for training or evaluation.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract detailed information about each dataset mentioned. This includes:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics (e.g., types of data, annotations).
   - Any specific metrics or benchmarks associated with the dataset.

4. **Check for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will look for citations in the text that provide the source of each dataset. This may include references to previous works or datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will ensure to note the full citation for each dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

5. **Compile Full Citations**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the full citation. This includes the authors, title of the work, publication venue, and year. If the dataset is from a paper, I will format the citation according to standard academic conventions.

6. **Review and Confirm**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness. I will cross-check the dataset names and citations against the references section of the paper to confirm that I have captured all necessary details.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract the datasets from the paper and provide accurate citations for each one.
