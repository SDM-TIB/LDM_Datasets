To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-based Adversarial Meta-Reinforcement Learning" by Zichuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "several continuous control benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using "a variety of continuous control tasks based on OpenAI gym," which indicates that the datasets are likely related to these tasks.

In the **experiments subsection 5.1**, the authors specifically mention using three popular MuJoCo environments: **Hopper**, **Walker**, and **Ant**. They describe the task parameters and the reward functions associated with these environments, which confirms that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following relevant works:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which includes various environments like Hopper, Walker, and Ant. The citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **MuJoCo**: This is a physics engine for model-based control, which is used in the environments mentioned. The citation is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, M. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Hopper** (part of OpenAI Gym)
- **Walker** (part of OpenAI Gym)
- **Ant** (part of OpenAI Gym)

With the following citations:
- OpenAI Gym: Brockman et al. (2016)
- MuJoCo: Todorov et al. (2012)

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding citations from the research paper.
