To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense" by Artur dâ€™Avila Garcez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the experiments conducted to evaluate their method. In this section, they mention using a specific game environment for their experiments, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used.

In **Experiment 1**, the authors describe training agents in grids of increasing sizes, but they do not specify a dataset name. Instead, they refer to the game environment they created for their experiments. I will note that this game environment is a custom setup rather than a publicly available dataset.

In **Experiment 2**, the authors mention a deterministic configuration and a random configuration for the objects in the grid. Again, they do not reference any external datasets but rather describe the experimental setup they designed.

In **Experiment 3**, they continue to discuss the same game environment, indicating that the experiments are based on their own constructed scenarios rather than established datasets.

Throughout the paper, the authors do not cite any external datasets or benchmarks commonly used in reinforcement learning research. Instead, they focus on their own experimental setups and results.

Since there are no external datasets mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will summarize the experimental setups used in the paper, noting that they are custom environments created by the authors.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, emphasizing that the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a custom game environment used for their experiments. This will be important for anyone looking to understand the context of the experiments conducted in this research.
