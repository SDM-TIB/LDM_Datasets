To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeDUCE: Generating Counterfactual Explanations Efficiently" by Benedikt Höltgen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **MNIST dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as the only widely used image dataset in the literature on counterfactual explanations, which confirms its significance in the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the MNIST dataset, which is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
