To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Continuous-Time Q-Learning for Mean-Field Game and Mean-Field Control Problems" by Xiaoli Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to gather detailed information about each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and their relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly presented with its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly according to the style used in the paper, whether it be APA, MLA, or another format, to maintain consistency and professionalism in the documentation of the datasets.
