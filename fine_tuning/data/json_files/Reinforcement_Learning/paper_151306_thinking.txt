To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SKoPe3D: A Synthetic Dataset for Vehicle Keypoint Perception in 3D from Traffic Monitoring Cameras" by Himanshu Pahadia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the SKoPe3D dataset, indicating that it is a synthetic dataset generated using the CARLA simulator, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the dataset. In this case, the paper describes the SKoPe3D dataset in detail, including its size, structure, and the types of annotations it contains. I will note the key features mentioned, such as the number of images, the number of vehicle instances, and the keypoints annotated.

In the **experiments section**, I will confirm that the SKoPe3D dataset was used for training and evaluation purposes. This will help solidify my understanding that this dataset is central to the research findings presented in the paper.

After gathering the necessary information about the dataset, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the SKoPe3D dataset. Since this dataset is introduced in this paper, I will use the citation of the paper itself as the authoritative source.

The full citation for the SKoPe3D dataset is:
> Himanshu Pahadia, Duo Lu, Bharatesh Chakravarthi, Yezhou Yang. *SKoPe3D: A Synthetic Dataset for Vehicle Keypoint Perception in 3D from Traffic Monitoring Cameras*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly describes the SKoPe3D dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset for future reference or analysis.
