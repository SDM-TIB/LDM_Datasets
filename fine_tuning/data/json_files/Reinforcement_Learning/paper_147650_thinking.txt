To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inferring and Executing Programs for Visual Reasoning" by Justin Johnson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model using the **CLEVR benchmark for visual reasoning**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial to their work.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of visual reasoning and mention the **CLEVR dataset** as a benchmark that contains ground-truth programs for answering questions. This reinforces the importance of the CLEVR dataset in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **CLEVR dataset**. They also mention collecting a new dataset of human-posed free-form natural language questions about CLEVR images, referred to as the **CLEVR-Humans dataset**. This indicates that there are two datasets of interest.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **CLEVR Dataset**: This dataset is designed for visual question answering and contains algorithmically generated questions about images. Each question is associated with a ground-truth program that describes the reasoning required to answer it.

2. **CLEVR-Humans Dataset**: This dataset consists of natural language questions posed by human workers about CLEVR images. It includes 17,817 training questions, 7,202 validation questions, and 7,145 test questions. The questions are designed to be challenging and require reasoning skills.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CLEVR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., & Girshick, R. (2017). CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **CLEVR-Humans dataset**, since it is a new dataset collected by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Johnson, J., Hoffman, J., Hariharan, B., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., & Girshick, R. (2017). CLEVR-Humans: A dataset of human-posed questions about CLEVR images. Available from the first author's website.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
