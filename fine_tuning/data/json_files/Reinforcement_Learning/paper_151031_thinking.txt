To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Conservative Q Learning for Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" by Jianzhun Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four environments including both discrete and continuous action settings on both existing and our man-made datasets." This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) to find specific mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on various environments, including:

1. **Equal Line**: A man-made environment designed for their experiments.
2. **Multi-agent Particle Environment**: The authors mention using datasets and adversary agents provided by Pan et al. (2022).
3. **Multi-agent MuJoCo**: Again, they refer to datasets provided by Pan et al. (2022).
4. **StarCraft II**: The authors state that they generated their own datasets for this environment.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Multi-agent Particle Environment** and **Multi-agent MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Pan, L., Rashid, T., Peng, B., Huang, L., and Whiteson, S. "Plan better amid conservatism: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning with actor rectification." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 17221â€“17237, 2022.

- For the **StarCraft II** datasets, the authors mention that they generated their own datasets, so there is no external citation for this.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Equal Line**: A man-made environment created for the experiments.
2. **Multi-agent Particle Environment**: Datasets and adversary agents provided by Pan et al. (2022).
3. **Multi-agent MuJoCo**: Datasets provided by Pan et al. (2022).
4. **StarCraft II**: Custom datasets generated by the authors.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets used in the experiments, particularly for the datasets referenced from Pan et al. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
