To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Know your Enemy: Investigating Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Opponent Models in Pommerman" by Jannis Weil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including how they were generated or sourced. In this paper, the authors mention generating a dataset with one million samples from SimpleCpp agents playing FFA games, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **training setup** subsection, as it often details the data used for training models. Here, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of samples and the conditions under which they were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Pommerman Environment Dataset**: This dataset consists of one million samples generated from SimpleCpp agents playing FFA games. The citation for the Pommerman environment is:
   > Cinjon Resnick, Wes Eldridge, David Ha, Denny Britz, Jakob N. Foerster, Julian Togelius, Kyunghyun Cho, and Joan Bruna. *Pommerman: A Multi-Agent Playground*. In Joint Proceedings of the Workshops co-located with the 14th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment, 2018.

2. **RawNet Dataset**: This dataset is used as an opponent model in the experiments. The citation for the RawNet model is:
   > Johannes Czech, Moritz Willig, Alena Beyer, Kristian Kersting, and Johannes FÃ¼rnkranz. *Learning to Play the Chess Variant Crazyhouse Above World Champion Level With Deep Neural Networks and Human Data*. Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
