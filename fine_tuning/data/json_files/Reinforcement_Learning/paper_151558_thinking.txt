To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MDPO: Conditional Preference Optimization for Multimodal Large Language Models" by Fei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on "three widely used benchmarks," which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names of these benchmarks or datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the models and datasets used. Here, they mention using "10K preference data from Silkie" and reference "LLaVA-Instruct-150K." This indicates that these are datasets relevant to their experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Main Results)**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on three benchmarks: **MMHalBench**, **Object HalBench**, and **AMBER**. I will note these benchmarks as they are likely datasets used for evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **Silkie Dataset**: The authors refer to this dataset as containing preference data for training. The citation is:
   > Li, H., Xie, Z., Li, M., Chen, S., Wang, P., Chen, L., Yang, Y., Wang, B., & Kong, L. (2023). Silkie: Preference distillation for large visual language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.10665.

2. **LLaVA-Instruct-150K**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of instructions for training. The citation is:
   > Liu, H., Li, C., Li, Y., & Lee, Y. J. (2024). Visual instruction tuning. Advances in neural information processing systems, 36.

3. **MMHalBench**: This benchmark is used to evaluate the model's performance. The citation is:
   > Sun, Z., Shen, S., Cao, S., Liu, H., Li, C., Shen, Y., Gan, C., Wang, Y.-X., Yang, Y., et al. (2023). Aligning large multimodal models with factually augmented RLHF. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.14525.

4. **Object HalBench**: Another benchmark mentioned for evaluation. The citation is:
   > Rohrbach, A., Hendricks, L. A., Burns, K., Darrell, T., & Saenko, K. (2018). Object hallucination in image captioning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.02156.

5. **AMBER**: This benchmark is also used for evaluation. The citation is:
   > Wang, J., Wang, Y., Xu, G., Zhang, J., Gu, Y., Jia, H., Yan, M., Zhang, J., & Sang, J. (2023). An LLM-free multi-dimensional benchmark for MLLMs hallucination evaluation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.07397.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
