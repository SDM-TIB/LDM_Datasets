To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Average-Reward Criterion" by Yiming Zhang and Keith W. Ross, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the environments or benchmarks used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may reference specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets, benchmarks, or environments, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. 

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments. I will note that MuJoCo is a physics engine widely used for simulating robotic tasks, and it serves as a benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or benchmarks mentioned. For the MuJoCo environments, I will look for the original paper or documentation that describes these environments.

The citation for the MuJoCo environments is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset used in the research.

In summary, I will ensure that I have:
1. Identified the dataset(s) mentioned in the paper.
2. Retrieved the full citation for each dataset from the references.
3. Compiled the information in a clear and organized manner for further use or processing.
