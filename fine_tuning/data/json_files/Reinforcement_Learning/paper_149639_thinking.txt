To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Query Answering under Uncertainty to Neuroscientific Ontological Knowledge: The NeuroLang Approach" by Gaston E. Zanitti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the availability of numerous datasets in neuroscience, which suggests that specific datasets might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the use of the **Neurosynth database**, which is a significant dataset in the context of neuroimaging. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the types of data it contains.

Additionally, the paper references the **CogAt ontology** and the **IOBC ontology**, which are also important datasets in the context of the research. I will extract relevant information about these ontologies, including their purposes and how they are utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The datasets I will extract and document are:

1. **Neurosynth Database**: This dataset is mentioned as containing a vast number of studies and terms related to neuroimaging. I will look for specific details such as the number of studies and the types of data it includes.

2. **CogAt Ontology**: This ontology is referenced as a structured knowledge base that aids in the analysis of cognitive processes. I will extract details about its structure and how it relates to the research.

3. **IOBC Ontology**: Similar to the CogAt ontology, this dataset is used for enriching the analysis. I will gather information about its contents and relevance to the study.

Once I have compiled the necessary information about each dataset, I will ensure to write down the full citations as follows:

- For the **Neurosynth Database**, the citation is:
  > Yarkoni, T., Poldrack, R. A., Nichols, T. E., et al. (2011). Large-scale automated synthesis of human functional neuroimaging data. *Nature Methods*, 8(8), 665–670. https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1635

- For the **CogAt Ontology**, the citation is:
  > Poldrack, R. A., Kittur, A., Kalar, D., et al. (2011). The Cognitive Atlas: Toward a Knowledge Foundation for Cognitive Neuroscience. *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 5. https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2011.00017

- For the **IOBC Ontology**, the citation is:
  > Nieuwenhuys, R. (2012). The insular cortex: A review. *Progress in Brain Research*, 195, 123–163. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53860-4.00007-6

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
