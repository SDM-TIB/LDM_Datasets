To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variance Reduction Based Partial Trajectory Reuse to Accelerate Policy Gradient Optimization" by Hua Zheng and Wei Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for empirical validation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **yeast cell fermentation simulator** and refer to a dataset from their previous work. I will note this as it indicates the presence of a dataset, but I need to find the exact citation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference their previous work, which is crucial for providing the correct citation for the yeast cell fermentation dataset.

The relevant citations I find are:

1. For the yeast cell fermentation simulator, the citation is:
   > Hua Zheng, Wei Xie, Ilya O Ryzhov, and Dongming Xie. *Policy optimization in bayesian network hybrid models of biomanufacturing processes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.06543, 2021b.

2. The paper also references the original work on the green simulation approach:
   > Hua Zheng, Wei Xie, and M Ben Feng. *Green simulation assisted policy gradient to accelerate stochastic process control*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.08902, 2021a.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
