To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Go-Blend Behavior and Affect" by Matthew Barthet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new paradigm for affective computing and references the use of a dataset of human play sessions. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **background** and **case study** sections. In the case study section, the authors describe the "Endless Runner" game and mention that it features an accompanying dataset of 112 annotated human play sessions, which is referred to as the **AGAIN dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experimental protocol** and **results** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are further details about the AGAIN dataset that could be relevant.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the AGAIN dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> David Melhart, Antonios Liapis, and Georgios N. Yannakakis. *The Affect Game AnnotatIoN (AGAIN) dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.02643, 2021.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **AGAIN Dataset**: This dataset consists of 112 annotated human play sessions from the "Endless Runner" game, which can be used for modeling arousal in gameplay.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its full citation as required.
