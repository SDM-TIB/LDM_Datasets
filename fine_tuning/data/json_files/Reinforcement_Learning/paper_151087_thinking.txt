To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Navigating the Structured What-If Spaces: Counterfactual Generation via Structured Diffusion" by Nishtha Madaan and Srikanta Bedathur, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of counterfactual explanations and mention that their experiments evaluate the quality of generated counterfactuals on three datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains educational, demographic, and occupancy information of individuals. The authors specify the features used, which include hours per week, education level, occupation, work class, race, age, marital status, and sex.

2. **UCI Bank Dataset**: This dataset pertains to the marketing campaigns of a banking institution, providing insights into customer interactions and responses.

3. **Housing Price Dataset**: This dataset includes information about housing prices in California, detailing various attributes such as income, population, house occupancy, latitude, longitude, and general information regarding the houses in different districts.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**:
  > A. Frank, “UCI Machine Learning Repository,” http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml, 2010.

- For the **UCI Bank Dataset**:
  > M. S., R. P., and C. P., “Bank Marketing,” UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2012, DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5K306.

- For the **Housing Price Dataset**:
  > R. K. Pace and R. Barry, “Sparse spatial autoregressions,” Statistics & Probability Letters, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 291–297, 1997.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
