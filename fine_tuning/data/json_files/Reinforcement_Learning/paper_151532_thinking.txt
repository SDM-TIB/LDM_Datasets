To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Frequency Scheduling by Learning Parallel Actions" by Anastasios Giovanidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of frequency scheduling in multi-user MIMO systems but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more specific information.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach and any experimental setups. Here, they mention using a simulation environment to evaluate their proposed architectures, but they do not specify any datasets used for training or testing.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation. The authors describe their experimental setup, including parameters and configurations, but again, there is no mention of specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the research. I will look for papers that might have provided datasets for similar studies.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to reinforcement learning and resource management, but none of these references explicitly mention datasets. 

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will document the references that could potentially lead to datasets in future research.

Now, I will compile the relevant citations from the references section:

1. **M. Rasti et al.** (2022). "Evolution toward 6G multi-band wireless networks: A resource management perspective." IEEE Wireless Communications, 29(4), 118â€“125.
2. **K. Boutiba et al.** (2022). "Radio resource management in multi-numerology 5G new radio featuring network slicing." In ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications.
3. **P. Kela and T. Veijalainen** (2023). "Cooperative action branching deep reinforcement learning for uplink power control." In 2023 Joint European Conference on Networks and Communications & 6G Summit.

Since no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that the search for datasets was unsuccessful, but I have documented the relevant citations for future reference.
