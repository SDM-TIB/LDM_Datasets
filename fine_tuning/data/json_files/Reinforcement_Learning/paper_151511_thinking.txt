To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Rewards in Restless Multi-Armed Bandits" by Naveen Raman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will closely examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **synthetic data** and **real-world data from food rescue**. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their evaluation on synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset from a food rescue organization. They describe the food rescue dataset as containing data on volunteer participation and engagement, which is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper may not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, especially if they are proprietary or unpublished datasets. However, I will look for any references to prior works that describe the datasets or methodologies used to collect them.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors created synthetic datasets to evaluate their proposed methods. These datasets are not formally cited as they are generated for the purpose of this research.

2. **Food Rescue Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a partnering multi-city food rescue organization. The authors describe it as containing data on volunteer engagement and trip completion rates. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, as it is likely proprietary.

Since the food rescue dataset is the only real-world dataset mentioned, I will note that it is essential to provide context about its origin and usage in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include any relevant details about the datasets, their purposes, and any citations if available. If no formal citations are provided, I will note that the datasets are proprietary or unpublished.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- **Synthetic Datasets**: No formal citation, generated for research purposes.
- **Food Rescue Dataset**: No formal citation, derived from a partnering organization.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of citation.
