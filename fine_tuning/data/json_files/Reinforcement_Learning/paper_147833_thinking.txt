To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling the Dynamic Joint Policy of Teammates with Attention Multi-agent DDPG" by Hangyu Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on benchmark tasks and real-world packet routing tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating ATT-MADDPG on both benchmark tasks and real-world tasks. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two benchmark environments: **Cooperative Navigation** and **Predator Prey**. However, they do not provide specific datasets for these environments, as they are likely simulated environments rather than traditional datasets.

In addition, the authors describe a **packet routing environment** based on a small topology and a large topology, which are also not traditional datasets but rather experimental setups. They reference the **Abilene Network** as a real-world topology used for scalability tests, which may imply the use of real network traffic data.

Since the paper does not provide formal datasets with citations, I will note the environments and their descriptions instead:

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: A simulated environment where agents navigate to cover landmarks on a 10x10 grid.
2. **Predator Prey**: A simulated environment where predators attempt to catch a prey on a 10x10 grid.
3. **Packet Routing Environment**: Includes a small topology and a large topology based on the real Abilene Network.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any relevant citations that may correspond to datasets or environments. However, since the environments are not traditional datasets, I will not find specific citations for them.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **Cooperative Navigation**: No formal citation, described as a simulated environment.
- **Predator Prey**: No formal citation, described as a simulated environment.
- **Packet Routing Environment**: Based on the Abilene Network, but no specific dataset citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, I will document the environments and their descriptions without formal citations. This approach ensures that I accurately reflect the content of the paper while adhering to the requirement for full citations where applicable.
