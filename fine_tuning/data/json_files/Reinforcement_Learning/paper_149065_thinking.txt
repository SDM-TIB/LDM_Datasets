To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robotic Surgery With Lean Reinforcement Learning" by Yotam Barnoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the da Vinci Skill Simulator (dVSS) for training surgical robots, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets associated with this simulator.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the dVSS-RL environment. Here, they mention that the dVSS is a training device used by surgeons, which indicates that the simulator itself may serve as a dataset for training reinforcement learning agents.

I will also look for any specific datasets or environments that are referenced in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss using the dVSS-RL for training agents on tasks like suturing and reaching, but I need to confirm if they provide any additional datasets or references to external datasets.

In the **related work section**, the authors cite other works that may have used datasets relevant to robotic surgery or reinforcement learning. I will check these citations for any datasets that could be applicable.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to the dVSS or any other specific datasets, I will ensure to document their full citations accurately.

For example, if the paper mentions the da Vinci Skill Simulator as a dataset, I will note it down as follows:
- **da Vinci Skill Simulator**: This is the primary dataset used in the experiments, providing a realistic environment for training surgical robots.

Next, I will compile the full citations for any external datasets mentioned in the references. If the authors refer to any specific studies or datasets, I will extract the citation details from the references section.

Finally, I will summarize the identified datasets, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name and its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
