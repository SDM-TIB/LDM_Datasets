To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JiangJun: Mastering Xiangqi by Tackling Non-Transitivity in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games" by Yang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyzed over **10,000 records of human Xiangqi play**, which suggests a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the complexity of Xiangqi and the need for empirical data, which reinforces the idea that they have utilized a dataset for their analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that they compiled more than **7,000 game records** from matches played between JiangJun and human opponents through a WeChat mini program. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **methods section** where they describe the analysis of real-world Xiangqi data obtained from the **Play OK game platform**. This indicates that the dataset used for their analysis is sourced from this platform, which is crucial for citation.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Xiangqi Game Records Dataset**: This dataset consists of over **10,000 records of human gameplay** sourced from the Play OK game platform. It serves as the foundational basis for their investigation into non-transitivity in Xiangqi.

2. **WeChat Mini Program Game Records**: This dataset includes **7,061 game records** collected from matches played between the JiangJun agent and human players over six months. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the JiangJun algorithm.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. 

For the **Xiangqi Game Records Dataset**, the citation is:
> Play OK. *Play OK Game Platform*. Available at: https://www.playok.com

For the **WeChat Mini Program Game Records**, the citation is:
> JiangJun. *JiangJun Mini Program on WeChat*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/view/jiangjun-site/

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly to ensure that they are ready for inclusion in any structured format or further analysis.
