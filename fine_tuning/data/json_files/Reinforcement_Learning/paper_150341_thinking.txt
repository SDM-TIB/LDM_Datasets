To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Proximal Policy Optimization (HJBPPO)" by Amartya Mukherjee and Jun Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their algorithm's performance on various **MuJoCo environments**, which suggests that these environments may serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will specifically note the environments mentioned:
1. **Ant-v4**
2. **HalfCheetah-v4**
3. **Humanoid-v4**
4. **HumanoidStandup-v4**
5. **InvertedPendulum-v4**
6. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v4**
7. **Reacher-v4**
8. **Swimmer-v4**
9. **Hopper-v4**
10. **Walker2d-v4**

These environments are part of the MuJoCo physics engine, which is commonly used for reinforcement learning tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The MuJoCo environments are typically referenced in the context of the original MuJoCo paper. The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:

- For **MuJoCo**:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 5026-5033.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are the MuJoCo environments, and the full citation for the MuJoCo simulator is provided above. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources from the research paper.
