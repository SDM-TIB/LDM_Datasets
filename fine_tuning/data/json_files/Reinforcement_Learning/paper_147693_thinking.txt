To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Frame skip Deep Q Network" by Aravind S. Lakshminarayanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on Atari 2600 games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation on three specific Atari games: **Seaquest, Space Invaders, and Alien**. This indicates that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments, as they are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

I will also check the **related work section** (section 2) and the **conclusions section** (section 6) for any additional context or references to datasets. However, it appears that the primary datasets are the games themselves, which are part of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. Since the datasets are the games from the ALE, I will cite the original paper that introduced the ALE:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 253-279.

Additionally, I will note that the specific games (Seaquest, Space Invaders, and Alien) are part of the ALE, and thus the citation for the ALE serves as the authoritative reference for these datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ensuring that I have accurately documented the sources as required.
