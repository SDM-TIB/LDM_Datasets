To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Environment Transformer and Policy Optimization for Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Pengqin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of offline datasets for learning transition dynamics and reward functions, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on widely studied offline RL benchmarks, which typically involve specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention four environments: **Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d**. They also refer to five types of datasets: **full-replay, medium-expert, medium-replay, medium, and random**. However, I need to confirm the exact datasets used and their citations.

I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites a relevant dataset reference:

- For the **D4RL datasets**, which include the environments mentioned, the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

This citation provides the necessary information about the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Ant Environment Datasets**: Includes full-replay, medium-expert, medium-replay, medium, and random datasets.
2. **HalfCheetah Environment Datasets**: Similar types as Ant.
3. **Hopper Environment Datasets**: Similar types as Ant.
4. **Walker2d Environment Datasets**: Similar types as Ant.

Since the paper does not provide separate citations for each dataset type but refers to the D4RL project, I will use the D4RL citation for all datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
