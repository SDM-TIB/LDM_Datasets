To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Meta-Critic Learning for Off-Policy Actor-Critic Methods" by Wei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology and experiments, as they typically contain detailed information about the datasets used. I will pay attention to any mentions of specific environments or benchmarks, as these often correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their methods on several continuous control tasks using environments from **OpenAI Gym** and **MuJoCo**. These environments are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, but I need to confirm if they are treated as datasets in the context of this paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using a suite of seven MuJoCo tasks and two MuJoCo tasks in rllab, as well as a simulated racing car environment called **TORCS**. These environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. The references for the environments are typically found in the references section of the paper. I will look for citations related to OpenAI Gym, MuJoCo, and TORCS.

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. In arXiv, 2016.

2. **MuJoCo**: The citation is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IROS, 2012.

3. **TORCS**: The citation is:
   > Daniele Loiacono, Luigi Cardamone, and Pier Luca Lanzi. *Simulated car racing championship: Competition software manual*. In arXiv, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper attribution.
