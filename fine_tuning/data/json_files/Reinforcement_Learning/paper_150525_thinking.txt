To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Optimization Achieves Global Optimality in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Yulai Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract mentions the development of a multi-agent PPO algorithm, but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work.

Following that, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may also provide insights into the datasets they utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets related to multi-agent reinforcement learning, which may include:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment**: A common benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks.
2. **StarCraft II Learning Environment**: Often used for evaluating multi-agent algorithms in complex environments.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
