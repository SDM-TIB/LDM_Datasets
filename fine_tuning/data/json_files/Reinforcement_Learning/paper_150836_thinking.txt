To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Heat Transfer Control of Pulsating Impinging Jets" by Sajad Salavatidezfouli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for thermal control, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about thermal control and references various studies, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. I will look for any references to datasets, simulations, or experimental data that the authors may have utilized in their study.

Upon reviewing the **methodology**, I find that the authors mention using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver for their simulations, but they do not specify any datasets derived from external sources. Instead, they describe the parameters and conditions of their own experimental setup, which includes a hot plate and a cooling jet.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on their simulations and control strategies, but again, there are no references to external datasets. They focus on the performance of their DRL methods and the effectiveness of their thermal control system.

Since no external datasets are mentioned throughout the paper, I will conclude that this research does not utilize any publicly available datasets. Therefore, there are no citations to extract for datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses a novel approach to thermal control using DRL, it does not reference any datasets that would require citation.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in this research paper, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
