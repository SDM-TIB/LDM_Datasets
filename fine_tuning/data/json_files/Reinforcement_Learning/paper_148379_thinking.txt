To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistically Model Checking PCTL Specifications on Markov Decision Processes via Reinforcement Learning" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or case studies.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentioning datasets that are relevant to the study.

Then, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Sum of Two Dice program," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from a known source, I will ensure to include that source's citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
