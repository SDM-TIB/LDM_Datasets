To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Good Trajectories in Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Qi Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss evaluating their method on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often outline the context of their research and may reference specific datasets or environments. Here, they mention using datasets from environments like **StarCraft II**, **multi-agent particle environment (MPE)**, and **multi-agent mujoco**. This indicates that these environments are likely associated with specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. They specifically mention constructing agent-wise imbalanced multi-agent datasets based on several maps in **StarCraft II**, **MPE**, and **MAmujoco**. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets, including any details about their composition or characteristics.

The paper provides detailed information about the datasets in **Appendix C**, where they describe the data generation methods and the specific maps used for creating the datasets. For example, they mention datasets like:

1. **StarCraft II Datasets**: These datasets are constructed from various maps such as **2s vs 1sc**, **3s vs 5z**, and **2s3z**. Each dataset contains a specific number of trajectories and is categorized by the quality of the policies used to generate them.

2. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) Datasets**: The authors describe datasets generated from cooperative navigation and predator-prey tasks, detailing the composition of agents and their respective behaviors.

3. **Multi-Agent Mujoco Datasets**: These datasets are derived from continuous control tasks, specifically using environments like **HalfCheetah 2l** and **Walker 2l**.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the original sources of these datasets, if available. For instance, the datasets from **StarCraft II** and **MPE** are often referenced in the context of their original papers or benchmarks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **StarCraft II Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Samvelyan, M., Rashid, T., Schroeder de Witt, C., Farquhar, G., Nardelli, N., Rudner, T. G., Hung, C.-M., Torr, P. H., Foerster, J., & Whiteson, S. (2019). *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS).

- For **MPE Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y. I., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, O. P., & Mordatch, I. (2017). *Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- For **MAmujoco Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A Physics Engine for Model-Based Control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented with its characteristics and the corresponding citations, ready for further processing or review.
