To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning in Markov Decision Processes with Gap-Dependent Sample Complexity" by Anders Jonsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these sections usually detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics and sizes.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for the citation that corresponds to it, which might be something like:
> Brockman, G., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583, 2016.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
