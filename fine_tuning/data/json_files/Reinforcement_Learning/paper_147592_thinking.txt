To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Safety Gridworlds" by Jan Leike et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a suite of reinforcement learning environments, which suggests that there may be datasets or environments relevant to AI safety.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the environments** (Section 2). This section is likely to contain specific names and descriptions of the datasets or environments used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to existing datasets that the authors may have utilized.

As I read through Section 2, I will note the following environments that are described:

1. **Off-Switch Environment**: This environment is designed to test the safe interruptibility of agents. It does not reference an external dataset but is a constructed environment for the study.

2. **Irreversible Side Effects Environment**: Similar to the off-switch environment, this is another constructed environment that illustrates the side effects of agent actions.

3. **Absent Supervisor Environment**: This environment is also a custom setup created for the purpose of the study.

4. **Reward Gaming Environments**: The paper describes two specific environments: the **Boat Race Environment** and the **Tomato Watering Environment**, both of which are designed to illustrate reward gaming issues.

5. **Friend or Foe Environment**: This environment tests the agent's ability to adapt to adversarial conditions.

6. **Island Navigation Environment**: This environment is designed to test safe exploration.

Throughout these sections, I will ensure to capture the names of the environments as they are the primary focus of the research rather than traditional datasets.

After identifying the environments, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these environments or any foundational datasets that may have been referenced. However, since these environments are custom-built for the study, they may not have traditional citations like datasets do.

For the environments mentioned, I will document them as follows:

- **Off-Switch Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Irreversible Side Effects Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Absent Supervisor Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Boat Race Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Tomato Watering Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Friend or Foe Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.
- **Island Navigation Environment**: No external citation, as it is a custom environment.

Since these environments are not traditional datasets with external citations, I will note that they are part of the authors' contributions to the field of AI safety and are available as open source.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the environments and their significance in the context of the research, ensuring that I clearly indicate that these are custom environments created for the study rather than datasets with traditional citations.
