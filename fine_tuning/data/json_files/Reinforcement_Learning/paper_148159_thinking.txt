To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse Experience Replay" by Egor Rotinov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in Deep Q-learning and mentions the use of various tasks, which may imply the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the author describes two specific experiments: the **Mountain Car Problem** and **Atari Breakout**. These experiments likely involve datasets or environments that are standard in reinforcement learning research.

In **section 4.1 (Mountain Car Problem)**, the author references the Mountain Car environment, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. I will note that this environment is described in the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto, which serves as the authoritative source for this dataset.

In **section 4.2 (Atari Breakout)**, the author mentions that Atari video games, specifically Breakout, are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning. The paper references the work by Antonoglou et al. (2015) as a significant source for the DQN approach applied to Atari games. This indicates that the Atari Breakout environment is also a recognized dataset in the field.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Mountain Car Problem**, the citation is:
   > Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press, 2015. ISBN 00976156.

2. For the **Atari Breakout**, the citation is:
   > Ioannis Antonoglou, Andreas K. Fidjeland, Daan Wierstra, Helen King, Marc G. Bellemare, Shane Legg, Stig Petersen, Martin Riedmiller, Charles Beattie, Alex Graves, Amir Sadik, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Georg Ostrovski, Joel Veness, Andrei A. Rusu, David Silver, Demis Hassabis, Dharshan Kumaran, and Volodymyr Mnih. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529â€“533, 2015. doi: 10.1038/nature14236. URL http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14236.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and ready for further use or analysis.
