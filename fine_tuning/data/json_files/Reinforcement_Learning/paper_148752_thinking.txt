To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACDER: Augmented Curiosity-Driven Experience Replay" by Boyao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific tasks or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section V (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the robotic simulation environments used for their experiments. Here, they mention four specific tasks: **Reach, Push, Pick&Place, and Multi-Step Push**. I will look for any references to datasets or environments associated with these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used a robotic simulation provided by **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets or environments used for training and evaluation are part of the OpenAI Gym suite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is the primary source of the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Additionally, I will note that the specific tasks (Reach, Push, Pick&Place, and Multi-Step Push) are part of the environments provided by OpenAI Gym, but they do not have separate citations as they are standard tasks within the framework.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will include the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used for the experiments.
