To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A real-time iterative machine learning approach for temperature profile prediction in additive manufacturing processes" by Arindam Paul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data)**, where the authors describe the generation of the dataset. Here, they mention that the database for training the supervised model was developed using GAMMA, a finite element method (FEM) framework. This section is crucial as it likely contains detailed information about the dataset's characteristics, such as dimensions, voxel sizes, and the number of data points.

In this section, the authors specify that they utilized a FEM simulation of dimensions 20 mm x 20 mm x 3 mm with a voxel size of 0.5 mm, resulting in a total of 9600 voxels and approximately 9.05 million data points. This information is essential for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the dataset generated from GAMMA was indeed used for the experiments, ensuring that I have the correct dataset for citation.

After gathering the necessary details about the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the GAMMA framework, as it is the source of the dataset. The citation for GAMMA is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will need to look for the original paper or documentation related to GAMMA in the references.

Once I have all the information, I will compile the dataset details, including its characteristics and the full citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it includes all relevant information and citations for future reference.
