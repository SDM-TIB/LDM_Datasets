To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UCB Momentum Q-learning: Correcting the bias without forgetting" by Pierre MÃ©nard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the methodologies and datasets used for testing the proposed algorithms. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to reinforcement learning, as the focus is on a new algorithm for Q-learning. I will note any datasets that are used for simulations or comparisons with other algorithms.

Once I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details such as the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset cited in the paper.
