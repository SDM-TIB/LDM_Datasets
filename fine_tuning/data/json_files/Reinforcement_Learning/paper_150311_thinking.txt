To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Deep Double Dueling Q-Learning for Trading-Signal Execution in Limit Order Book Markets" by Peer Nagy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions using the **ABIDES limit order book simulator** and the **LOBSTER dataset** for simulating a realistic trading environment. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction discusses the use of the ABIDES simulator and mentions the LOBSTER dataset again, confirming its significance in the research.

I will then look into the **background** section, specifically under **3.1 Limit Order Book Data**, where the authors describe the use of equity limit order book data from the NASDAQ exchange and the LOBSTER dataset. This section provides context on how the datasets are utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section (5)**, the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention using **5.5 months of Apple (AAPL) limit order book data** from 2012-01-01 to 2012-05-16 for training and **1.5 months of out-of-sample data** from 2012-05-17 to 2012-06-31. This provides specific temporal details about the datasets used.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **LOBSTER Dataset**: The citation for the LOBSTER dataset is:
   > Ruihong Huang and Tomas Polak. *LOBSTER: Limit Order Book Reconstruction System*. Available at SSRN 1977207, 2011.

2. **ABIDES Simulator**: The citation for the ABIDES simulator is:
   > David Byrd, Maria Hybinette, and Tucker Hybinette Balch. *ABIDES: Towards High-Fidelity Market Simulation for AI Research*. In Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation, pages 11â€“22, 2020.

3. **Apple Limit Order Book Data**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation for the specific Apple limit order book data used, it is derived from the NASDAQ exchange. Therefore, I will note it as:
   > NASDAQ Equity Limit Order Book Data, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
