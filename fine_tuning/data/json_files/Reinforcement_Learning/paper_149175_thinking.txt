To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Head Overcoat Thickness Measure with NASNet-Large-Decoder Net" by Youshan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their model. Here, they state that their model was trained with data collected from three different dates, resulting in a total of **364 images**. This indicates that the dataset is relatively small and specific to their study.

In this section, the authors also mention that the images were manually segmented by an expert using thickness measurement software based on a previous work by Zhang et al. (2018). This suggests that the dataset may not be publicly available but is derived from a specific methodology.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for the original source of the dataset. The relevant citation for the software used for segmentation is:

- Zhang, C., Loken, K., Chen, Z., Xiao, Z., & Kunkel, G. (2018). Mask editor: an image annotation tool for image segmentation tasks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.06461.

Since the authors did not provide a specific name for their dataset, I will refer to it as the **HOC Thickness Dataset** for clarity in my output.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
