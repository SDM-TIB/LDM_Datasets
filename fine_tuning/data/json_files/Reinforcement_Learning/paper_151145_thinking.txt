To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning" by Amelia Sorrenti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **Tiny-ImageNet**, and **FG-ImageNet**. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used image classification dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet containing 200 classes, with 500 images per class, resized to 64x64 pixels.

3. **FG-ImageNet**: A fine-grained image classification benchmark with 100 classes of animals, used to test continual learning methods.

In this section, the authors also describe how they split these datasets into tasks for their experiments, which is relevant for understanding their application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge (CS231n)*, 2015. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet.

- For **FG-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Split FG-ImageNet is derived from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
