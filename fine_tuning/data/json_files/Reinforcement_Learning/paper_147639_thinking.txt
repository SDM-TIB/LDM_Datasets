To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-efficient Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Data for Dialogue Management" by Pei-Hao Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a "corpus of demonstration data" for pre-training models, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. I will note this down for further investigation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors state that they utilized a corpus of "720 real user spoken dialogues in the Cambridge restaurant domain." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being used for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, size, and how it was collected. The paper mentions that the corpus was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 4:1:1 ratio, which is useful information for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as being collected via the Amazon Mechanical Turk service and cite a previous work (Su et al., 2016b) that describes the dataset collection process. I will retrieve the full citation for this reference.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Pei-Hao Su, Milica Gaˇsi´c, Nikola Mrkˇsi´c, Lina Rojas-Barahona, Stefan Ultes, David Vandyke, Tsung-Hsien Wen, and Steve Young. *On-line active reward learning for policy optimisation in spoken dialogue systems*. In Proceedings of ACL, 2016.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **Cambridge Restaurant Dialogue Corpus**: This dataset consists of 720 real user spoken dialogues collected for the purpose of training dialogue systems. It is specifically designed for the restaurant domain and is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
