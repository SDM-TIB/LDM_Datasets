To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Model-free Reinforcement Learning in Metric Spaces" by Zhao Song and Wen Sun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the work, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is a specific section titled "Datasets" or similar, I will focus on that.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as needed.
