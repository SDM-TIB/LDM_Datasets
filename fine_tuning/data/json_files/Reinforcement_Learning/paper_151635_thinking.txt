To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Reward Shaping for Multi-Agent Pathfinding" by Zhenyu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the methodologies used, including any datasets employed for testing their proposed methods. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in a standard MAPF (Multi-Agent Pathfinding) environment but do not explicitly mention any specific datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setup, including the number of agents and the grid sizes used for testing. This suggests that the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment rather than on publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or datasets are referenced that could be relevant to the experiments. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on their proposed method and its performance rather than relying on established datasets.

Given that no explicit datasets are mentioned, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper. The experiments were conducted in a simulated environment designed for MAPF tasks, and the authors did not reference any external datasets.

2. **References to foundational works** related to MAPF and reinforcement learning techniques were noted, but these do not constitute datasets themselves.

In conclusion, while the paper presents a novel approach to cooperative reward shaping in multi-agent systems, it does not utilize or reference any specific datasets for its experiments. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned in the research.
