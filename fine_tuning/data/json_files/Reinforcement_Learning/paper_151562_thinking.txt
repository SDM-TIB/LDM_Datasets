To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Transport-Assisted Risk-Sensitive Q-Learning" by Zahra Shahrooei and Ali Baheri, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their validation of the proposed algorithm in a **Gridworld environment**. This indicates that the Gridworld setup is a key component of their experiments, but I need to confirm if it is a publicly available dataset or a custom environment created for the study.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or environments that may have been used in the study. If the authors refer to any established datasets or environments, I will need to extract their full citations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors specifically mention using a **Gridworld environment** for their experiments. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this environment, as it is a common setup in reinforcement learning research. Therefore, I will note that the Gridworld environment is a standard benchmark in the field, but it does not have a specific citation.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Gridworld Environment**: A standard reinforcement learning environment used for testing the proposed algorithm. It does not have a specific citation as it is widely recognized in the literature.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its relevance to the research. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the study for future reference or analysis.
