To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARL-DTN: Context Adaptive Reinforcement Learning based Routing Algorithm in Delay Tolerant Network" by Fuad Yimer Yesuf and M. Prathap, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results for specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often contains details about the data sources, including any simulations or real-world datasets utilized for testing the proposed algorithm. If the authors mention specific datasets or simulation environments, I will note them down.

In the **results section**, I will look for any performance evaluations that reference datasets. The authors might discuss the datasets in the context of their experimental results, which can provide additional context about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific simulation tool or dataset, I will ensure to capture the full citation as follows:

- If they used a simulation tool like "The ONE simulator," I would note:
  > Ker√§nen, A., Ott, J., & Karkkainen, T. (2009). The ONE simulator for DTN protocol evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques (SIMUTOOLS), Rome, Italy.

- If they referenced a dataset from a previous study, I would find the original paper and cite it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized for further analysis or replication of the study.
