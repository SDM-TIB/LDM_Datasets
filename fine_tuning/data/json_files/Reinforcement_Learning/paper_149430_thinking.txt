To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Distilled Collaboration Graph for Multi-Agent Perception" by Yiming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the validation of the proposed method on **V2X-Sim 1.0**, indicating that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a detailed description of **V2X-Sim 1.0**, stating that it is a large-scale multi-agent 3D object detection dataset synthesized using CARLA and SUMO co-simulation. They describe the dataset's structure, including the number of scenes, frames, and the types of data collected.

The authors also mention that V2X-Sim 1.0 follows the storage format of **nuScenes**, which is another dataset. This indicates that the authors are building upon an existing dataset format, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the V2X-Sim 1.0 dataset. The paper states that it is maintained on a specific website, which I will note as part of the citation.

The full citation for the **V2X-Sim 1.0 dataset** is:
> Yiming Li, Shunli Ren, Pengxiang Wu, Siheng Chen, Chen Feng, and Wenjun Zhang. *V2X-Sim 1.0: A Multi-Agent 3D Object Detection Dataset*. Available at: https://ai4ce.github.io/V2X-Sim/.

Additionally, I will also note the citation for the **nuScenes dataset** since it is referenced in the context of the V2X-Sim 1.0 dataset:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
