To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CERTIFAI: Counterfactual Explanations for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial Intelligence models" by Shubham Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the CERTIFAI framework but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments. Specifically, in **subsection 4.1 (Robustness)**, they refer to the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The authors describe how they use this dataset to train a convolutional neural network and generate adversarial examples.

Next, I will look for additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In **subsection 4.2 (Explainability)**, the authors discuss the **Pima Indian dataset** and the **UCI adult dataset**. The Pima Indian dataset is used to predict diabetes risk, while the UCI adult dataset is used to predict income levels based on various features.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. **Pima Indian Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Smith, J. W., Everhart, J. E., Dickson, W. C., Knowler, W. C., & Johannes, R. S. *Using the adap learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus*. 1988.

3. **UCI Adult Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kohavi, R. *Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid*. 1996.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
