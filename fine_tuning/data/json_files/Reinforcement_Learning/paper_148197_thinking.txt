To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Drone Mobility Support Using Reinforcement Learning" by Yun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a handover mechanism for cellular-connected drones, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Simulation Results)**, where the authors describe their simulation setup. Here, they mention collecting **10,000 samples of RSRP values** corresponding to 21 cells for different user equipment (UE) locations at an altitude of 50 m. This indicates that there is a dataset related to RSRP values, but I need to clarify its source and citation.

In the **data pre-processing subsection**, the authors describe how they collected RSRP samples and normalized them. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset. I will need to check the **References section** to see if there are any papers or sources that might have provided the RSRP data or similar datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to UAVs and cellular networks, but none of them directly provide a dataset citation for the RSRP values used in their simulations. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from their own simulations and does not have a formal citation.

Next, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **RSRP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 samples of RSRP values collected from 21 cells for various UE locations at an altitude of 50 m. The data was normalized to the interval [0, 1] and partitioned into bins for analysis.

Since there is no formal citation for the RSRP dataset, I will indicate that it is based on the authors' own simulation results.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations where applicable. 

In conclusion, I will document the dataset as follows:
- RSRP Dataset: Derived from the authors' simulations, no formal citation available.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for datasets and documented them accurately, even when formal citations are not provided.
