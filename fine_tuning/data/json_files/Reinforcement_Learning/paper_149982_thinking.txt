To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Joint V2I Network Selection and Autonomous Driving Policies" by Zijiang Yan and Hina Tabassum, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous works and may reference datasets used in those studies. I will look for any citations that indicate the use of specific datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically provide the most information about the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check there as well, as authors often discuss the datasets in the context of their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to V2I communication, autonomous driving, or reinforcement learning, as these are the main themes of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
