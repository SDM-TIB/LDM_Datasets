To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Dialog Policies from Weak Demonstrations" by Gabriel Gordon-Hall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of dialog data to guide the agent, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of training dialog managers and refer to the use of external dialog datasets. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsections where the authors describe their experts: Full Label Expert (FLE), Reduced Label Expert (RLE), and No Label Expert (NLE). Each of these subsections may contain specific datasets used for training these experts.

Upon reviewing the **experimental setup**, the authors explicitly mention training their experts on the **MultiWOZ dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to extract its details.

Additionally, they mention using two out-of-domain datasets: **Microsoft E2E** and **Maluuba Frames**. I will ensure to note these datasets as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **MultiWOZ Dataset**:
   > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Osman, R., & Gašić, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2018, pages 5016–5026.

2. **Microsoft E2E Dataset**:
   > Li, X., Chen, Y.-N., Li, L., & Gao, J. (2018). Microsoft Dialogue Challenge: Building End-to-End Task-Completion Dialogue Systems. arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.11125.

3. **Maluuba Frames Dataset**:
   > El Asri, L., Schulz, H., Sharma, S., Zumer, J., Harris, J., Fine, E., Mehrotra, R., & Suleman, K. (2017). Frames: A Corpus for Adding Memory to Goal-oriented Dialogue Systems. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 207–219.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
