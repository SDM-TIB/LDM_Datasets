To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search Meets Reinforcement Learning" by Arash Vahdat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are commonly referenced, so I will look for their standard citations. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
