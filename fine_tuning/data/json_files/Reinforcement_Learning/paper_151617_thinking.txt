To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretability of Uncertainty: Exploring Cortical Lesion Segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis" by Nataliia Molchanova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cortical lesion segmentation and the importance of data quality, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **materials and methods section** where the authors describe their data collection process.

In **section 2.1 (Data)**, the authors state that they used a dataset obtained at the University of Basel, Switzerland, which includes 117 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). They provide details about the patient demographics and the MRI acquisition protocol, but they do not provide a formal name for the dataset. However, they reference that this dataset has been previously explored in other studies, which indicates it may be a recognized dataset in the field.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to several studies that may have utilized this dataset, particularly the one by La Rosa et al. (2020), which discusses multiple sclerosis cortical and white matter lesion segmentation.

The citation for the dataset used in this study is:
> La Rosa, F., Abdulkadir, A., Fartaria, M.J., Rahmanzadeh, R., Lu, P.J., Galbusera, R., BarakoviÄ‡, M., Thiran, J., Granziera, C., Cuadra, M.B. (2020). *Multiple sclerosis cortical and WM lesion segmentation at 3T MRI: a deep learning method based on FLAIR and MP2RAGE*. NeuroImage: Clinical, 27, 102335.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Cortical Lesion Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset consists of MRI scans from 117 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, focusing on cortical lesion segmentation. The dataset includes various demographic details and MRI acquisition protocols.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.
