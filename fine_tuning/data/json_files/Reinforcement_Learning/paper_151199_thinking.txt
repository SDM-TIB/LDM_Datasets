To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OASim: an Open and Adaptive Simulator based on Neural Rendering for Autonomous Driving" by Guohang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of high-quality datasets for autonomous driving, which suggests that datasets will be referenced throughout the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for vast amounts of data for testing autonomous vehicles, hinting at the use of specific datasets. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Data Collection and Processing)**, where the authors list specific datasets used in their work. They mention three well-annotated public datasets:

1. **Waymo Open Dataset**: This dataset is known for its comprehensive annotations for autonomous driving tasks.
2. **NuScenes**: A multimodal dataset that provides a rich set of sensor data for autonomous driving.
3. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-established dataset in the field of computer vision and robotics, particularly for autonomous driving applications.

In the **experiments section**, the authors demonstrate the high-fidelity data generated by their simulator and compare it with the Waymo Open Dataset, confirming its relevance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, X., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2446–2454, 2020.

- For the **NuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., and Beijbom, O. "nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., and Urtasun, R. "Vision meets robotics: The kitti dataset." The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
