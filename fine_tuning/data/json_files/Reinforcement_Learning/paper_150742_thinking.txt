To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Network for Stochastic Process Environments" by Kuangheng "Gerald" He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of reinforcement learning in environments like Flappy Bird and a stock trading simulation, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be present.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to look for specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the author describes two main environments: the **Flappy Bird** game and a **stock trading simulation**. I need to determine if these environments are based on existing datasets or if they are custom-built simulations.

In the **Flappy Bird section**, the author mentions using the game as a training environment for the DQN agent. However, since Flappy Bird is a game, it does not reference a traditional dataset but rather a game environment that can be simulated.

In the **stock trading environment section**, the author states that the trading simulation uses historical data from four symbolic stocks with the highest trading volume from 2018 to 2020. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find citations for any datasets or related works. The paper cites several references, but I need to focus on those that pertain to the stock trading data. The reference to the stock trading environment is not explicitly detailed in the citations, so I will note that the dataset is based on historical stock data but lacks a formal citation.

To summarize, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Flappy Bird Environment**: This is a game environment and does not have a traditional dataset citation.
   
2. **Stock Trading Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical data from four symbolic stocks with the highest trading volume from 2018 to 2020. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of each dataset and the lack of formal citations where applicable. This will help in understanding the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the experiments conducted.
