To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UTTS: Unsupervised TTS with Conditional Disentangled Sequential Variational Auto-encoder" by Jiachen Lian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction may also provide context about the datasets and their significance in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **VCTK Corpus**: The authors state that they exclude speaker p315 due to unavailable transcriptions and randomly select 90% of the speakers for the training set and the remaining 10% for the test set. They also mention the data is downsampled to 16k Hz and provide details about the mel spectrogram extraction.

2. **LibriTTS**: The authors mention that they downsample the original LibriTTS data to 16k Hz and use the original training split for various training tasks. They also provide details about the mel spectrogram extraction for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **VCTK Corpus**, the citation is:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and K. MacDonald. *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit*. 2017.

- For the **LibriTTS**, the citation is:
  > H. Zen, R. Clark, R. J. Weiss, V. Dang, Y. Jia, Y. Wu, Y. Zhang, and Z. Chen. *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from LibriSpeech for text-to-speech*. In Interspeech, 2019. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02882

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
