To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "KITTI-CARLA: a KITTI-like dataset generated by CARLA Simulator" by Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the KITTI-CARLA dataset, indicating that it is generated from the CARLA simulator and is designed for testing semantic segmentation and odometry methods.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. Here, I find that the KITTI-CARLA dataset consists of 7 sequences, each containing 5000 frames, recorded in various environments (city, suburban area, mountain, rural area, highway). This section confirms the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references two key sources:

1. For the **CARLA Simulator**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (Vol. 78, pp. 1–16). PMLR. Available at: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v78/dosovitskiy17a.html

2. For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 3354–3361).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The KITTI-CARLA dataset is the primary dataset mentioned, and I will ensure to include the full citations for both the CARLA simulator and the KITTI dataset as they are essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the KITTI-CARLA dataset, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are included for clarity and completeness.
