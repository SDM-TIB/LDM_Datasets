To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating or Propagating Gradients Through Stochastic Neurons for Conditional Computation" by Yoshua Bengio, Nicholas LÃ©onard, and Aaron Courville, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of stochastic neurons and their implications for deep learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction provides background on stochastic neurons and their relevance but does not specify any datasets used in the experiments.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the architecture and the datasets used. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of the conditional computation experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is widely known and used for handwritten digit classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the MNIST dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
