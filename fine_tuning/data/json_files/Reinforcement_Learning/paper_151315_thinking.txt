To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guiding the generation of counterfactual explanations through temporal background knowledge for Predictive Process Monitoring" by Andrei Buliga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of methods using "different real-life datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five different publicly available real-life event logs, which are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed methods. I will carefully note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **BPIC2012**: This dataset includes the loan application process execution history for a Dutch banking institution. It is used for classification tasks based on the outcome of loan applications.

2. **BPIC2015**: This dataset consists of event logs from five different municipalities in the Netherlands regarding building permit applications. Each municipality's data is treated as a separate event log.

3. **BPIC2017**: Similar to BPIC2012, this dataset originates from the same financial institution but with improved data collection methods.

4. **Sepsis**: This dataset records cases of patients with possible symptoms of sepsis in a hospital setting, documenting events from admission to discharge.

5. **Legal Complaints**: This dataset records execution traces of public contract auctions in Italy, focusing on whether any recourses have been registered.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
