To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A hybrid level-based learning swarm algorithm with mutation operator for solving large-scale cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization problems" by Massimiliano Kaucic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results use **three large-scale datasets**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** (Section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention the datasets from the **OR-Library**:

1. **S&P 500 Dataset**: This dataset includes 457 weekly prices and 290 assets.
2. **Russell 2000 Dataset**: This dataset includes 1318 weekly prices and 290 assets.
3. **Russell 3000 Dataset**: This dataset includes 2151 weekly prices and 290 assets.

The authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that clearly outlines the datasets, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The datasets are sourced from the OR-Library, and while the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, I can reference the OR-Library itself as the source for these datasets.

The citation for the OR-Library is:
> Beasley, J. E. (1990). OR-Library: Distributing test problems by electronic mail. *Journal of the Operational Research Society*, 41(11), 1069-1072.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OR-Library as the source for the datasets used in the experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.
