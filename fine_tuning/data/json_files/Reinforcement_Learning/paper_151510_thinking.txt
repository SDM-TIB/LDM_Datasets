To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Play 7 Wonders Duel Without Human Supervision" by Giovanni Paolini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the AI system, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the training process for ZeusAI. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors mention generating **35,000 games** using three simple rule-based policies, which indicates that they created a dataset from self-play games. However, I need to confirm if this dataset is formally named or if there are any other datasets referenced.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional datasets that may have been used for analysis or comparison. The authors discuss various statistics derived from the self-play games, but they do not mention any external datasets or benchmarks.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. However, it appears that the authors primarily relied on self-generated data from their AI's gameplay rather than established external datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal names for any datasets beyond the self-play games, I will note that the primary dataset is the **self-play dataset generated by ZeusAI**, which consists of approximately **420,000 self-play games**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the AI's performance and strategies.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- **Self-Play Dataset**: A dataset generated from 420,000 self-play games used to train and evaluate ZeusAI.

Citation for the paper:
> Giovanni Paolini, Lorenzo Moreschini, Francesco Veneziano, Alessandro Iraci. "Learning to Play 7 Wonders Duel Without Human Supervision." IEEE, 2024.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
