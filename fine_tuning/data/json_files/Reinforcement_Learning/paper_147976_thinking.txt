To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Parameter Control in Differential Evolution" by Mudita Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or benchmark functions used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets or benchmark functions used for training and testing their methods. In this paper, the authors mention using functions from the **CEC2005 benchmark suite** for both training and testing. This indicates that the datasets are related to optimization problems.

In the **introduction**, the authors state that they trained their model on 16 functions from the CEC2005 benchmark and tested it on a different set of 5 functions. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets involved, but I need to find the exact names and details of these functions.

I will then look for a **table or a list** in the paper that summarizes the functions used. In this case, the authors mention that they excluded certain functions and provide a classification of the remaining functions into different categories. I will note down the specific functions used for training and testing.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CEC2005 benchmark suite. The citation typically includes the authors, title, and publication details, which are crucial for proper documentation.

The citation for the CEC2005 benchmark suite is:
> P. N. Suganthan, N. Hansen, J. J. Liang, K. Deb, Y. P. Chen, A. Auger, and S. Tiwari. *Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the CEC 2005 special session on real-parameter optimization*. Technical Report. Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 2005.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the functions used for training and testing, along with their respective citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use.
