To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Classification of Feedback Loops and Their Relation to Biases in Automated Decision-Making Systems" by Nicol√≤ Pagan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methodology for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the implications of feedback loops in machine learning systems but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for any datasets used in their analysis or simulations.

Next, I will check **section 5 (Case Study: Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems)**, where the authors describe a simulation involving a recommender system. They mention using a specific set of parameters and initial conditions for their experiments, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. Instead, they describe the dynamics of the system and the feedback loops involved.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the methodology or results, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through cited works. The authors reference various studies and papers that discuss feedback loops and biases in machine learning, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide specific dataset citations. Instead, they focused on theoretical frameworks and simulations based on their own constructed scenarios.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses important concepts related to feedback loops and biases in automated decision-making systems, it does not provide explicit datasets or citations for datasets used in their research. Therefore, I will not be able to extract any dataset citations from this paper.

If I were to summarize my findings, I would state:
- No specific datasets were mentioned or utilized in the research.
- The authors focused on theoretical contributions and simulations rather than empirical analysis based on existing datasets.
