To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TD3 with Reverse KL Regularizer for Offline Reinforcement Learning from Mixed Datasets" by Yuanying Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **D4RL datasets** and mixed datasets, which suggests that these are key datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the methodology, the authors refer to the **D4RL dataset** as a standard dataset used for evaluation. They also mention that their algorithm is tested on **mixed datasets** created by combining standard D4RL datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results comparing their method against others on various tasks using the D4RL datasets. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **D4RL HalfCheetah-Random**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms in a simulated environment.
2. **D4RL Hopper-Random**: Another dataset from the D4RL suite, focusing on a different task within the same simulation framework.
3. **D4RL Walker2d-Random**: A dataset for a third task in the D4RL suite, again focusing on a different robotic simulation.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The D4RL datasets are referenced as follows:

- For the **D4RL datasets**, the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
