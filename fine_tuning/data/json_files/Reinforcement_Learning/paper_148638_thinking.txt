To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Transferred Energy Management Strategy for Hybrid Electric Vehicles via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Teng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their energy management strategies using a real-world driving cycle dataset from the Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC). This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section 2.3 (Driving Cycle Dataset)**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. In section 2.3, they describe the TSDC dataset, which includes aggregated statistics, trip driving distances, and second-by-second profiles (speed and acceleration) collected from vehicles equipped with GPS. They also mention that the dataset comprises light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles.

The authors specify that they utilized **20 driving cycles** from the TSDC dataset, labeled as Cycle 1 to Cycle 20, for their experiments. This is crucial information that confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the TSDC dataset. The paper cites the TSDC as follows:

- **Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC)**: 
  > Record S D T. Transportation secure data center. 2011.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset properly.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC)**: A dataset containing real-world driving cycle data, including vehicle speed and acceleration profiles, collected from various types of vehicles.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
