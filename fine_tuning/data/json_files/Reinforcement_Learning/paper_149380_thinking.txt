To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial Counterfactual Identification from Observational and Experimental Data" by Junzhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets. This could be labeled as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or similar. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to sections that describe the experiments or methodologies, as they often detail the datasets used.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., observational, experimental), and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

4. **Check for References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that are cited as the origin of the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The title or name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear reference for future readers and researchers.
