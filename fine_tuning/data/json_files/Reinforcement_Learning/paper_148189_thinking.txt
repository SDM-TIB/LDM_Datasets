To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-stage WECC Composite Load Modeling: A Double Deep Q-Learning Networks Approach" by Xinan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Western Electricity Coordinating Council Composite Load Model (WECC CLM)** and indicates that the proposed method is verified using an **IEEE 39-bus test system**. This suggests that these two could be potential datasets or models used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section II (WECC CLM Introduction)** and **section IV (Case Studies)**. In these sections, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, models, or systems that are utilized for the experiments or simulations.

In **section II**, the authors describe the structure of the WECC CLM and its components, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation. However, they do mention that the WECC CLM is available from multiple commercial simulation tools, which implies that the model itself is a dataset used for simulations.

In **section IV (Case Studies)**, the authors conduct experiments using the **IEEE 39-bus system**. They mention that the transient stability test cases are conducted using this system, which serves as a dataset for their experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The references may provide additional context or sources for the datasets used in the study.

1. **Western Electricity Coordinating Council Composite Load Model (WECC CLM)**:
   - Citation: Western Electricity Coordinating Council, Technical Reference Document: "WECC Composite Load Model Specifications," Jan. 2015, https://www.wecc.org/

2. **IEEE 39-bus test system**:
   - Citation: Kundur, P. *Power System Stability and Control*. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
