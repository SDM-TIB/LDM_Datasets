To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Loss Adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay" by Zhuoying Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed ALAP algorithm in various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention testing their algorithm in environments from **OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that the datasets used for evaluation may be related to these environments.

I will specifically check the **experiments section** for details on the environments used. The paper mentions three environments: **cartpole-v0**, **simple**, and **simple tag**. These environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these environments from the references section. The OpenAI Gym is referenced as follows:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Next, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the experiments. The environments mentioned (cartpole-v0, simple, and simple tag) are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning, and they are part of the OpenAI Gym framework.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

After completing this process, I will be ready to present the dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
