To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Language Technologies for Social Good: The Road not Taken" by Namrata Mukhija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the development of language technology for marginalized communities, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will examine the **methodologies and case studies** sections, as these parts often contain detailed descriptions of datasets used in the research. I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized in the studies or methodologies discussed.

In the **case studies section**, the authors mention "TICO-19," which is a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations to translate COVID-19 content into various languages. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with this initiative, specifically the TICO-19 benchmark.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TICO-19 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Anastasopoulos, A.; Cattelan, A.; Dou, Z.-Y.; Federico, M.; Federman, C.; Genzel, D.; Guzm√°n, F.; Hu, J.; Hughes, M.; Koehn, P.; et al. 2020. TICO-19: The Translation Initiative for COVID-19. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.01788.

Next, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of methodologies or other case studies. The paper discusses various methodologies for eliciting user preferences and values but does not explicitly mention additional datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TICO-19 dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for TICO-19, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
