To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning and the Deadly Triad" by Hado van Hasselt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments using the **Atari Learning Environment**. This is a well-known benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, and it is crucial to note that it serves as a dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Atari Learning Environment is cited as follows:

- For the Atari Learning Environment, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. However, the primary dataset used for the experiments appears to be the Atari Learning Environment.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
