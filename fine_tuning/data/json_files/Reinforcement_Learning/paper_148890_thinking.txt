To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clusterability as an Alternative to Anchor Points When Learning with Noisy Labels" by Zhaowei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method using both synthetic noisy labels on CIFAR-10/100 and real human-level noisy labels on Clothing1M, which suggests that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluate their method on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Clothing1M**. I will note these datasets down as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **Clothing1M**: The citation is:
   > T. Xiao, T. Xia, Y. Yang, C. Huang, and X. Wang. *Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR-10**: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report.
- **CIFAR-100**: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report.
- **Clothing1M**: Xiao, T., Xia, T., Yang, Y., Huang, C., & Wang, X. (2015). *Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
