To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Efficient Drone Mobility Support" by Yun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (which is often where datasets are described in detail). In this paper, the authors mention generating **10,000 samples of RSRP values** for various cells at different UE locations. This indicates that there is a dataset related to RSRP values.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or provide additional context. For example, the paper includes figures illustrating the simulation results and the cell association map, which may provide insights into the data used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution.

From my reading, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **RSRP Dataset**: The authors generated a dataset of RSRP values for 21 cells in a 2D geographical area of 5 × 6 km², with 10,000 samples collected at different UE locations. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on drone mobility support.

The citation for the methodology used to generate this dataset is:
> Y. Chen, X. Lin, T. Khan, and M. Mozaffari, “Efficient drone mobility support using reinforcement learning,” in IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conf. (WCNC), April 2020. Available at: arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.09715.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the information is complete and properly referenced for future use.
