To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuroCounterfactuals: Beyond Minimal-Edit Counterfactuals for Richer Data Augmentation" by Phillip Howard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of counterfactuals for data augmentation in NLP, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the experiments section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention the use of the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment classification tasks. They also refer to **SST-2**, **Twitter**, **Yelp**, and **Amazon** datasets for out-of-domain evaluations.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets** section or any part of the paper that lists the datasets in detail. The authors mention the **IMDB-S** dataset, which is a sentence-level version of the IMDB dataset, and they provide details about its size and how it was constructed. They also reference the **IMDB CF** dataset created by Kaushik et al. (2019) and the **SST-2 CF** dataset generated by Wu et al. (2021).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will include:

1. **IMDB dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
