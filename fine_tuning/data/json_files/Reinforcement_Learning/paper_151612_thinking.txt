To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Two-Step Minimax Q-learning Algorithm for Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games" by Shreyas S R and Antony Vijesh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of two-player zero-sum Markov games and reference various algorithms and prior works, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their empirical tests and comparisons of the proposed algorithm with existing methods. They mention that the experiments involve Markov games with varying states and actions, but they do not provide specific dataset names or references.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. However, the references primarily cite previous works and algorithms rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they generated their own Markov games for testing the proposed algorithm. Therefore, there are no datasets to extract or cite.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the implementation and performance of the proposed algorithm, it does not provide any datasets or references to datasets used in the experiments. Thus, there are no dataset entries to create for this paper.
