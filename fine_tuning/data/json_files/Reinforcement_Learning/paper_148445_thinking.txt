To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-guided Context Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection" by Junxu Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on object detection and instance segmentation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors specifically mention that they evaluated their model on the **MS-COCO 2017 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for object detection tasks. This is a clear indication that I need to include this dataset.

I will also check the **related work section** and any other sections that might reference datasets used in previous studies. However, the primary dataset mentioned for their experiments is the MS-COCO dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:

> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset to extract is the MS-COCO dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information from the paper regarding the dataset used in their research.
