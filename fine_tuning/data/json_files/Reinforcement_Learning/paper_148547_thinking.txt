To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Radio Network Throughput Maximization with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kevin Shen Hoong Ong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning for maximizing network throughput, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors mention various DQN techniques and their performance metrics, but they do not specify any datasets directly. 

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies related to cognitive radio networks and reinforcement learning, but I need to determine if any of these studies provide datasets that the authors might have used.

After reviewing the references, I find that several papers discuss methodologies and frameworks relevant to cognitive radio networks, but none explicitly mention datasets that were utilized in this study. 

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note the relevant references that could potentially lead to datasets in future research.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **Relevant references that may contain datasets:**
   - S. Lee, R. Zhang, and K. Huang, “Opportunistic wireless energy harvesting in cognitive radio networks,” IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 12, no. 9, pp. 4788–4799, 2013.
   - X. Lu, D. Niyato, H. Jiang, D. I. Kim, Y. Xiao, and Z. Han, “Ambient backscatter assisted wireless powered communications,” IEEE Wireless Communications, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 170–177, 2018.
   - D. T. Hoang, D. Niyato, P. Wang, D. I. Kim, and Z. Han, “Ambient backscatter: A new approach to improve network performance for RF-powered cognitive radio networks,” IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 65, no. 9, pp. 3659–3674, 2017.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing.
