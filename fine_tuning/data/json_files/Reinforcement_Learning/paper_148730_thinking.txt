To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral classification of blood-like substances using machine learning methods combined with genetic algorithms in transductive and inductive scenarios" by Filip Pałka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a "forensic-inspired dataset of seven hyperspectral images with blood and five visually similar substances," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically section 3, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of multiple hyperspectral images of blood and blood-like substances, including artificial blood, tomato concentrate, and poster paint. They also specify that the images were captured using a SOC710 hyperspectral camera and detail the preprocessing steps taken.

In this section, the authors reference a specific dataset described in another paper, denoted as [36]. This is crucial because it indicates that the dataset has an authoritative citation that I need to retrieve.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned as [36]. The citation is:
> Michał Romaszewski, Przemysław Głomb, Arkadiusz Sochan, and Michał Cholewa. *A Dataset for Evaluating Blood Detection in Hyperspectral Images*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.10254, 2020.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including the authors, title, and where it can be found (arXiv).

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its description and citation, ensuring that I accurately represent the dataset as described in the paper. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's relevance and origin in the context of the research conducted.
