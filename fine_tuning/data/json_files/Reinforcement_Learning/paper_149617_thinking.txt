To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Atlas Segmentation and Spatial Alignment of the Human Embryo in First Trimester 3D Ultrasound" by Wietske A.P. Bastiaansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of ultrasound images acquired during the first trimester, which indicates that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of monitoring embryonic growth and development through ultrasound imaging. They mention the use of a multi-atlas framework, which suggests that multiple datasets may be utilized for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where they describe the data collection process. Here, the authors mention the **Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort (Predict study)**, which is a large hospital-based cohort study that collects 3D ultrasound scans at multiple points during the first trimester. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the subjects included in their study, including the number of subjects and the gestational weeks for which ultrasound images were collected. They specify that images were included if they had sufficient quality for manual annotation, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort. The citation is as follows:
> Rousian, M., Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C. M., Koning, A. H. J., Hop, W. C., Van der Spek, P. J., Exalto, N., & Steegers, E. A. P. (2021). Cohort Profile Update: the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort and embryonic and fetal measurements using 3D ultrasound and virtual reality techniques. *International Journal of Epidemiology*, 1-14.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using ultrasound images from eight subjects as atlases, which is part of the dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
