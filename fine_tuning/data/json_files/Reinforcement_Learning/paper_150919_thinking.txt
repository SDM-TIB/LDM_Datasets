To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action-Quantized Offline Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Skill Learning" by Jianlan Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of offline reinforcement learning and mentions "static behavior datasets," which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of offline reinforcement learning and the importance of datasets in training policies. However, they do not provide specific dataset names yet.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention using the **Robomimic environment** for testing their methods. They also refer to the **D4RL benchmark suite**, which is a collection of datasets for offline reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following datasets:

1. **Robomimic**: The citation for the Robomimic dataset is:
   > A. Mandlekar, D. Xu, J. Wong, S. Nasiriany, C. Wang, R. Kulkarni, F.-F. Li, S. Savarese, Y. Zhu, and R. Martín-Martín. *What matters in learning from offline human demonstrations for robot manipulation*. In 5th Annual Conference on Robot Learning, 2021. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=JrsfBJtDFdI.

2. **D4RL**: The citation for the D4RL benchmark suite is:
   > J. Fu, A. Kumar, O. Nachum, G. Tucker, and S. Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. In arXiv, 2020. URL https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07219.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
