To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing Age-of-Information for Fog Computing-supported Vehicular Networks with Deep Q-learning" by Maohong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a study on a multi-vehicle campus shuttle system, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this system.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. They mention a three-month measurement campaign with over 1,000,000 samples collected from connected vehicles, which implies that there is a dataset derived from this campaign.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the data collection process. The authors describe using an Android app to record round-trip times (RTTs), vehicle-related information, and other metrics. This indicates that the dataset includes RTT measurements and possibly other contextual data such as vehicle location, speed, and network connection.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or provide insights into how the data was analyzed. They discuss empirical PDFs of Age-of-Information (AoI) and the impact of various factors on AoI, which may be derived from the collected dataset.

After gathering this information, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to previous works and methodologies that may have used similar datasets or provided foundational data for their study.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. The key datasets I will focus on include:

1. **Multi-Vehicle Campus Shuttle System Dataset**: This dataset includes over 1,000,000 samples collected over three months, capturing RTTs and other vehicle-related metrics.

2. **Empirical PDFs of AoI**: Derived from the collected data, this dataset provides insights into the statistical distribution of AoI across different locations and conditions.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes a complete citation, referencing the original sources or methodologies used to collect the data. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
