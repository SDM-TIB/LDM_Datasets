To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Q-Learning Minimax Optimal? A Tight Sample Complexity Analysis" by Gen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as a dedicated **"Datasets"** or **"Experiments"** section. In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., et al. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any dedicated sections for datasets or experiments.
3. Note down the names and descriptions of the datasets.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear format for future reference.
