To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Arsh Tangri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of collecting expert demonstrations and mentions the use of offline datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the **Experiments section** (specifically section 5) discusses the datasets used for evaluation.

In section 5.2, the authors mention that they utilize datasets comprising all optimal transitions from an expert planner and datasets containing trajectories from a sub-optimal agent. They specify that the sub-optimal datasets include a mix of successful and failed episodes. This indicates that there are at least two types of datasets being referenced.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper cites the BulletArm benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used in the experiments.

The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **BulletArm Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the methods on various robotic manipulation tasks. The authors mention that it is an open-source robotic manipulation benchmark.

The citation for the BulletArm dataset is:
> Wang, D., Kohler, C., Zhu, X., Jia, M., & Platt, R. (2022). Bulletarm: An open-source robotic manipulation benchmark and learning framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
