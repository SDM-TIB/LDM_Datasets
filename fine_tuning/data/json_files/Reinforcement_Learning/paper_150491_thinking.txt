To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Noise Resilience of Successor Features and Predecessor Features Algorithms in One and Two-Dimensional Environments" by Hyunsu Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** (Section 4.1), where the author describes the environments used for testing the algorithms. Here, I will look for any references to datasets or environments that are explicitly named or described. The paper mentions a "noisy 1D grid world" and a "2D grid world," which are the environments used for the experiments. However, I need to check if these environments are based on any publicly available datasets or if they are original constructs created for the study.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to specific datasets used for comparison or evaluation. If the author mentions any established datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets or environments, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the environments are original, I will note that they are not publicly available datasets but rather custom environments created for the study.

For example, if the paper mentions using a specific dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari," I will ensure to extract the full citation for that dataset. If the environments are original, I will note that they are not available for public use.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset or environment, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experimental design section for specific environments used.
3. Check the results section for any established datasets referenced.
4. Consult the References section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets or environments referenced in the paper.
