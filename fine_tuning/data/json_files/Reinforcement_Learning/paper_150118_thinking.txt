To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Relational Reasoning via Connection Subgraph Pretraining" by Qian Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Table 1**, which summarizes the statistics of the benchmark datasets. This table lists three datasets: **NELL**, **FB15K-237**, and **ConceptNet**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of relations, entities, edges, and tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **NELL**: The citation for the NELL dataset is:
   > Xiong, W., Yu, M., Chang, S., Guo, X., & Wang, W. Y. (2018). One-shot relational learning for knowledge graphs. In EMNLP.

2. **FB15K-237**: The citation for the FB15K-237 dataset is:
   > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., & Gamon, M. (2015). Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases. In EMNLP.

3. **ConceptNet**: The citation for the ConceptNet dataset is:
   > Speer, R., Chin, J., & Havasi, C. (2017). ConceptNet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge. In AAAI.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily referenced by others interested in this research.
