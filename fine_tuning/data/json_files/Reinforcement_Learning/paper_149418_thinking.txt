To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EnTRPO: Trust Region Policy Optimization Method with Entropy Regularization" by Sahar Roostaie and Mohammad Mehdi Ebadzadeh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation. In this case, the authors describe their experimental setup for controlling a Cart-Pole system. I will look for any specific datasets or environments that are referenced.

In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors describe the experimental setup but do not explicitly mention a dataset. However, they refer to a "Cart and Pole" system, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. This indicates that they are using a standard environment rather than a unique dataset.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or citations for datasets, I will note that the primary environment used for experiments is the Cart-Pole system, which is widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works refer to datasets or environments that could be relevant. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper does not mention any unique datasets with full citations, it utilizes the Cart-Pole environment, which is a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. I will summarize this information accordingly.

Overall, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting that the primary environment used is the Cart-Pole system, and I will include a brief description of it as a widely recognized benchmark in reinforcement learning.
