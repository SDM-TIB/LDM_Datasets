To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Decision-Making Strategies for a Vehicle-Cyber-Physical-System in Connected Environment" by Teng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on decision-making strategies for autonomous vehicles, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the context of cyber-physical systems and connected automated vehicles but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology section** (Section III) where the authors describe the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms. This section may provide insights into the simulation environment or datasets used for training and testing the algorithms. However, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets here either.

Moving on to the **results and discussion section** (Section IV), I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of the algorithms in various driving scenarios but do not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the study. The references include various papers on cyber-physical systems and reinforcement learning, but I need to determine if any of these papers provide datasets that were utilized in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

If I had found datasets, I would have ensured to retrieve full citations for each dataset from the references section, as this is crucial for proper attribution. However, in this case, it appears that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.
