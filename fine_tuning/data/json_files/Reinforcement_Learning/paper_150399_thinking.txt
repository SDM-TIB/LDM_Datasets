To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Targeted Search Control in AlphaZero for Effective Policy Improvement" by Alexandre Trudeau and Michael Bowling, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Go-Exploit and its application in games like Connect Four and 9x9 Go, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for training and testing the algorithms. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention conducting experiments in Connect Four and 9x9 Go. I will check if they refer to any specific datasets or game configurations that serve as benchmarks for their experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets:

1. **Connect Four Dataset**: This dataset may consist of game states and outcomes used to train the AlphaZero and Go-Exploit algorithms. I will look for specific details about its construction and any relevant citations.

2. **9x9 Go Dataset**: Similar to the Connect Four dataset, this may include game states and outcomes for the 9x9 Go game. I will ensure to find the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
