To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Implicit Bias in Semi-Gradient Q-Learning: Visualizing the Effective Loss Landscapes via the Fokkerâ€“Planck Equation" by Shuyu Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their experiments or analyses. If they mention specific datasets or data collection methods, I will note them down.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training or testing the models. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. They may provide insights into how the datasets impacted their results or any comparisons made between different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Grid World Environment" or "Mini-batch Data from MDP," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. If they are not original datasets but rather well-known datasets, I will provide the standard citations for those.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
