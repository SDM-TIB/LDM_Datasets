To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the Model Unavailable MARE using Q-Learning Algorithm" by Fei Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE) and its applications, but there are no datasets mentioned here either. I will continue to the **methodology and results sections** to check for any experimental data or datasets used in their simulations.

Upon reviewing the **methodology**, the authors describe their approach using the Q-learning algorithm but do not specify any datasets. They mention numerical simulations, which typically imply the use of datasets, but no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the numerical simulations. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical developments and does not provide any empirical datasets or benchmarks for validation.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references mainly consist of previous studies and theoretical papers related to the MARE and Q-learning, without specific datasets being highlighted.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in this paper, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
