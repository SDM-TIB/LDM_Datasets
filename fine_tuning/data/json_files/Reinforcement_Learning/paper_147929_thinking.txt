To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum" by Joseph West et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the methodologies employed, including any datasets utilized for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two games: **Racing Kings** and **Reversi**. I will look for any specific datasets or game environments that are referenced in relation to these games.

In the **system design section**, the authors describe the game environments and the parameters used for training the AI players. They mention that the Racing Kings game environment is part of a suite of Chess variants and that the Reversi environment is based on a specific reference. I will need to identify if these environments are considered datasets or if they reference any external datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets or game environments mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets or game rules from other works, I will need to extract those citations.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the datasets and their citations. For the **Racing Kings** and **Reversi** environments, I will note that they are game environments rather than traditional datasets, but I will still provide citations for the sources that describe these games.

Here are the citations I will include:

1. For **Racing Kings**:
   > Racing kings. [Online]. Available: https://lichess.org/variant/racingKings

2. For **Reversi**:
   > T. Landau. Othello: Brief & basic. [Online]. Available: http://www.tlandau.com/files/Othello-B&B.pdf

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset or game environment is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
