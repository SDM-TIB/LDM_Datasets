To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Proximal Operators to Discover Multiple Optima" by Lingxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions an "exhaustive benchmark for multi-solution optimization," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Applications)**, where the authors describe various applications of their method. Each application may reference specific datasets used for benchmarking. 

1. **Sampling from Level Sets**: The authors mention using a family of functions for sampling from level sets, but they do not specify a dataset here.

2. **Sparse Recovery**: The authors describe a sparse recovery problem and mention generating data on-the-fly, but again, no specific dataset is cited.

3. **Rank-2 Relaxation of Max-Cut**: They mention using Erdős-Rényi graphs and the complete graph K8 for their experiments. I will need to find citations for these graph types.

4. **Symmetry Detection of 3D Shapes**: The authors refer to the MCB dataset for symmetry detection. I will look for the full citation for this dataset.

5. **Object Detection in Images**: The authors mention using the COCO2017 dataset for object detection. I will also retrieve the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MCB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kim, S., Chi, H.-G., Hu, X., Huang, Q., & Ramani, K. (2020). A large-scale annotated mechanical components benchmark for classification and retrieval tasks with deep neural networks. In Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **COCO2017 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 740–755.

- The **Erdős-Rényi graphs** and **complete graph K8** do not have specific citations as they are well-known graph types in the literature, but I can note that they are standard constructs in graph theory.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the MCB and COCO datasets, while noting the standard nature of the graph types used.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
