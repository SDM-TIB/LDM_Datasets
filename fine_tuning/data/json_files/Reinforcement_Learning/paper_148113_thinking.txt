To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModelicaGym: Applying Reinforcement Learning to Modelica Models" by Oleh Lukianykhin and Tetiana Bogodorova, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the ModelicaGym toolbox for reinforcement learning applications, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be discussed. In this section, the authors describe the Cart-Pole balancing problem as a use case for their toolbox. They detail the parameters and configurations used for the experiments, but they do not mention any external datasets. Instead, they focus on the simulation of the Cart-Pole system using the ModelicaGym toolbox.

Since the paper primarily discusses the development and validation of the ModelicaGym toolbox rather than utilizing external datasets, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references mainly consist of papers and tools related to reinforcement learning and Modelica, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no external datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The focus is on the simulation environment created by the authors rather than on empirical datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the Cart-Pole problem and the ModelicaGym toolbox, it does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, there are no dataset citations to compile for this paper.

If I were to summarize my findings, I would state:
- No external datasets were mentioned or utilized in the experiments.
- The focus was on the development of a simulation toolbox rather than on empirical data analysis.

Thus, I will not create any dataset entries or citations for this paper.
