To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Black-Box Algorithms Using Probabilistic Contrastive Counterfactuals" by Sainyam Galhotra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **three real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **German Credit Data**: This dataset consists of records of bank account holders with their personal, financial, and demographic information. The prediction task is to classify individuals as good or bad credit risks.

2. **Adult Income Data**: This dataset contains demographic information of individuals along with their education, occupation, and working hours. The task is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000.

3. **COMPAS**: This dataset contains information on offenders from Broward County, Florida, and the task is to predict whether an individual will recommit a crime within two years.

4. **Drug Consumption**: This dataset includes demographic information and personality traits of individuals, with the task being to predict when an individual consumed magic mushrooms.

5. **German-syn**: This is a synthetic dataset generated following the causal graph of the German dataset, used to evaluate the correctness of the proposed method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
