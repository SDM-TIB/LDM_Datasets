To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nav-Q: Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning for Collision-Free Navigation of Self-Driving Cars" by Akash Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA driving simulator**, which suggests that this might be a dataset or benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of collision-free navigation and reference existing benchmarks, but I need to find explicit dataset names.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the **performance evaluation** subsection, the authors mention using the **CARLA-CTS1.0 benchmark** for training and evaluating their model. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CARLA-CTS1.0 benchmark is referenced as follows:
- For **CARLA-CTS1.0 benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., Koltun, V. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1â€“16, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the **CARLA-CTS1.0 benchmark** as a dataset.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now create structured entries for the datasets used in the research paper.
