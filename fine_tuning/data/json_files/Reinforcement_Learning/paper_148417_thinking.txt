To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Machine Learning based Framework for KPI Maximization in Emerging Networks using Mobility Parameters" by Joel Shodamola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a machine learning framework for optimizing network parameters but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine **section II (System Framework)** and **section III (Simulation Setup)**, where the authors describe their methodology. In these sections, they mention using an **industry-grade system-level simulator** to generate data related to the configuration and optimization parameters (COPs) and key performance indicators (KPIs). However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference.

I will also check the **results and analysis section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss the performance of various machine learning models but again do not specify any datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **acknowledgment and references sections** to see if any external datasets or sources are cited. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not mention a specific dataset used in this research.

Since the paper primarily discusses a simulation-based approach rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets, it appears that there are no publicly available datasets cited in this work. The data generated for the experiments is derived from the simulator and not from an established dataset.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any specific datasets, as the data used for the experiments is generated through a simulation rather than sourced from an external dataset. Therefore, there are no full citations to provide for datasets in this case.
