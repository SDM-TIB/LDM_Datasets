To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Better Variant of Self-Critical Sequence Training" by Ruotian Luo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the author mentions that all experiments are conducted on the **COCO captioning dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** or any other relevant sections. In this case, the paper does not mention any other datasets beyond COCO.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **COCO Dataset**: 
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset entry is complete and accurate.
