To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing the Long-Term Behaviour of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Pushing and Grasping" by Rodrigo Chau, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the experiments. In the abstract, I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to evaluate their methods.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the research. I will pay close attention to any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any references to the performance of the models on the datasets. This may include comparisons of results across different datasets or discussions about the implications of the dataset choices on the findings of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "MuJoCo" simulation environment, I will look for the citation:
> Roboti LLC. MuJoCo, 2018. URL http://www.mujoco.org.

If they referenced a specific dataset for reinforcement learning tasks, I will extract that citation as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
