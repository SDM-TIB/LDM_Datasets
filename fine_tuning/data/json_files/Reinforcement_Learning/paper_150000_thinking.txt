To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Counterfactual-Shapley Value: Attributing Change in System Metrics" by Amit Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for attributing changes in system metrics, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and evaluation sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to data sources. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **simulated datasets** based on a causal structure for their evaluation. They describe the generation of these datasets in detail, including the parameters and equations used to create them. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation for these simulated datasets, as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

Additionally, the authors mention using **real-world log data** from an ad matching system, specifically from July 6 to December 28, 2021. This dataset is crucial for their case study and is described in detail, including how the data is categorized and processed. However, similar to the simulated datasets, there is no formal citation provided for this dataset, as it is proprietary data from Microsoft.

To summarize the findings:
1. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors generated datasets based on a causal structure for their evaluation. However, there is no formal citation for these datasets as they are not publicly available.
2. **Real-World Log Data**: The authors used log data from an ad matching system from July 6 to December 28, 2021. Again, there is no formal citation as this data is proprietary.

Since there are no formal citations available for the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that the datasets are either simulated or proprietary and do not have publicly accessible citations.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal citations for both datasets.
