To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Domain Cyberspace Attack and Defense Game Based on Reward Randomization Reinforcement Learning" by Lei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a game model for cyberspace attack and defense but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention using a **Python simulation** to create a cyberspace environment, but they do not specify any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setup, including the physical spaces and equipment used in their simulations.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **related works section** (Section 2) for any references to datasets used in previous studies. However, the references primarily discuss theoretical frameworks and do not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. The references include various papers related to game theory and cybersecurity, but again, they do not specify datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created a simulated environment for their research. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings and note that while the paper discusses a novel approach to cyberspace attack and defense using reinforcement learning, it does not provide any datasets for citation or further use. 

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.
