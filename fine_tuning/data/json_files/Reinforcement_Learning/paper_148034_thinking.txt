To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experience Replay Optimization" by Daochen Zha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various continuous control tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to identify their specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of experience replay in reinforcement learning and reference various algorithms and studies. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely. The authors state that they conducted experiments on **8 continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that the datasets used for these experiments are likely the environments provided by OpenAI Gym.

I will then look for any specific references to these environments in the text. The authors list the tasks as follows:
- InvertedDoublePendulum-v2
- Hopper-v2
- HalfCheetah-v2
- InvertedPendulum-v2
- HumanoidStandup-v2
- Reacher-v2
- Humanoid-v2
- Pendulum-v0

These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it serves as the source for the datasets used in the experiments. The relevant citation is:

> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environments**: This includes the following tasks:
   - InvertedDoublePendulum-v2
   - Hopper-v2
   - HalfCheetah-v2
   - InvertedPendulum-v2
   - HumanoidStandup-v2
   - Reacher-v2
   - Humanoid-v2
   - Pendulum-v0

The full citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
