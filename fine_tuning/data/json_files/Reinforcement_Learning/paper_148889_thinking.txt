To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Internal State Representations through Self-Supervision" by Julien Scholz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed methods in OpenAI Gym environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for testing their methods. In this section, they mention two specific environments:

1. **CartPole-v1**: This is a classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The authors indicate that this environment is part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

2. **LunarLander-v2**: This is another environment from OpenAI Gym where the task is to land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. The authors also specify that this environment is used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since both environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the citation that describes the OpenAI Gym toolkit:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries. Each dataset will include the name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for further processing or review.
