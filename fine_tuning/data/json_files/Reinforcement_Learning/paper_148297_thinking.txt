To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Experience Selection for Policy Gradient" by Saad Mohamad and Giovanni Montana, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on "8 continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym library," which indicates that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention that they implemented their method on various environments from the OpenAI Gym library, specifically listing environments such as Inverted Pendulum, Inverted Double Pendulum, Reacher, Hopper, HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Ant, and Humanoid. Each of these environments corresponds to a specific dataset used for training and evaluation.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets associated with the OpenAI Gym environments. The OpenAI Gym library itself is a well-known resource, and I can find its citation as follows:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

For each of the environments mentioned, I will ensure to note that they are part of the OpenAI Gym library, which serves as the dataset source for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym library as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environments**: 
   - Environments: Inverted Pendulum, Inverted Double Pendulum, Reacher, Hopper, HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Ant, Humanoid.
   - Citation: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
