To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PQLM - Multilingual Decentralized Portable Quantum Language Model" by Shuyue Stella Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed model on downstream tasks, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often provides context for the research and may highlight the datasets' significance.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their models. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Multilingual Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of 69,491 training documents and 998 test documents, labeled with four sentiment categories: negative, positive, neutral, and irrelevant.

2. **English-Hindi Code-Mixed Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from SemEval-2020 Task 9 and contains 15,000 training and validation documents, along with 3,789 test documents.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Multilingual Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis.

For the **English-Hindi Code-Mixed Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
> Patwa, P., Aguilar, G., Kar, S., Pandey, S., PYKL, S., Gambäck, B., Chakraborty, T., Solorio, T., & Das, A. (2020). *SemEval-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Barcelona (online), pp. 774–790.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the content of the paper. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or sharing.
