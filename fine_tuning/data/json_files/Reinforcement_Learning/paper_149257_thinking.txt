To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Scheduling of Isolated Microgrids Using Automated Reinforcement Learning-based Multi-period Forecasting" by Yang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a forecasting model for renewable power generations and loads, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these topics.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors may reference existing datasets used for training or validation of their models. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the subsection discussing the "Multi-period Renewable Power Outputs and Load Forecasting," the authors describe using data from a microgrid from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. This indicates that there is a dataset related to renewable energy outputs and load data over this time period. I will extract this information and note the specifics of the dataset, including the time frame and the type of data collected.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used, such as their structure, size, or any preprocessing steps taken. This may help in understanding how the datasets were utilized in their experiments.

After gathering all relevant information, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to publicly available datasets, I will ensure to include the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced.

For the dataset related to the microgrid data, I will note the following citation:
- For the microgrid data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, the citation is:
  > Yang Li, Ruinong Wang, and Zhen Yang. *Optimal Scheduling of Isolated Microgrids Using Automated Reinforcement Learning-based Multi-period Forecasting*. IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 736â€“745, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures all the necessary details, including the full citations for each dataset identified in the paper.
