To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pseudorehearsal in Value Function Approximation" by Vladimir Marochko, Leonard Johard, and Manuel Mazzara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses reinforcement learning and catastrophic forgetting but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using a **pole balancing task** as the environment for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name; instead, they describe the observations and parameters used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will need to look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets relevant to the experiments conducted. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers in reinforcement learning and related fields, but none of these references point to a specific dataset that was used in their experiments. The focus seems to be on the algorithms and methodologies rather than on specific datasets.

Given this analysis, it appears that the paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets that can be cited. Instead, the experiments are based on a simulated environment (the pole balancing task) rather than a dataset derived from real-world data.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the experimental setup and methodologies, it does not provide any datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to extract any dataset entries for this paper.
