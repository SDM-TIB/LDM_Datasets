To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Value Functions from Undirected State-Only Experience" by Matthew Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper tackles learning value functions from undirected state-only experience, which suggests that there may be datasets used for experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention conducting experiments in five environments: **2D Grid World, Freeway (Atari), 3D Visual Navigation, Maze2D (2D Continuous Control), and Kitchen Manipulation**. I will note down these environments as they likely correspond to specific datasets.

I will then look for any **dataset descriptions** within the text. For example, the paper may provide details about how the datasets were collected or any specific characteristics of the datasets used in each environment. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **2D Grid World**: The dataset is generated from a fixed, sub-optimal policy in a 6x6 grid environment. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is likely a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the study.

2. **Freeway (Atari)**: The authors mention that they generated their own data using a protocol described in Agarwal et al. (2020). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rishabh Agarwal, Dale Schuurmans, and Mohammad Norouzi. "An optimistic perspective on offline reinforcement learning." In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 104–114. PMLR, 2020.

3. **3D Visual Navigation**: The dataset is based on the branching environment from Chang et al. (2020). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Matthew Chang, Arjun Gupta, and Saurabh Gupta. "Semantic visual navigation by watching YouTube videos." In NeurIPS, 2020.

4. **Maze2D (2D Continuous Control)**: The authors use the Maze2D dataset from D4RL. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Oﬁr Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. "D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

5. **Kitchen Manipulation**: The dataset comes from the partial version of the D4RL FrankaKitchen dataset. The citation is the same as for the Maze2D dataset:
   > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Oﬁr Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. "D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research paper.
