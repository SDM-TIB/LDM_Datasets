To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Steerable Laser-based Optical Wireless Systems" by Abdelrahman S. Elgamal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This is often where datasets are detailed, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted simulations based on a specific room configuration and parameters. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the simulation setup, as these often include details about the datasets or parameters used.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to datasets. The references may include foundational datasets or previous works that the authors relied upon for their research.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile a list of datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. If the paper does not explicitly mention a dataset but refers to a simulation setup, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors used a specific simulation environment or parameters derived from previous studies, I will include those references as part of the dataset extraction process.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the following:
- The name of the dataset or simulation parameters.
- A brief description of the dataset or parameters.
- The full citation for the dataset or the reference from which the dataset was derived.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
