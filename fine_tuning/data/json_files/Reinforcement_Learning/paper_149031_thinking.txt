To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Empowered Trajectory and Passive Beamforming Design in UAV-RIS Wireless Networks" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. I will look for specific names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific attributes that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "3D Radio Map," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is publicly available, I will note the URL or DOI for easy access.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
