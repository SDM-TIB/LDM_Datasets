To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RiemannONets: Interpretable Neural Operators for Riemann Problems" by Ahmad Peyvan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous work and may reference datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are relevant to their research.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Data Collection" or "Datasets."

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the performance of the models on different datasets. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets mentioned earlier.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the study.

Based on the content of the paper, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
