To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Methods for Point Source Localisation" by Tuomo Valkonen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that typically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets", "Experiments", or "Methodology". In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any section that outlines the experimental setup, as it is likely to contain information about the datasets used.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: As I read through the relevant sections, I will extract key details about each dataset, including:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
   - Any specific metrics or benchmarks associated with the dataset.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further information.

5. **Document the Findings**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The dataset name.
   - A description of the dataset.
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets have been captured and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure that the datasets from the paper are thoroughly documented and properly cited.
