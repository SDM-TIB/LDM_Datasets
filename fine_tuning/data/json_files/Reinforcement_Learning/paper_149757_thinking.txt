To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Process Knowledge-infused Learning for Suicidality Assessment on Social Media" by Kaushik Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for improved explanations in machine learning, particularly in the context of suicidality assessment, which suggests that datasets related to this topic may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) as a guideline for labeling data points. This indicates that the CSSRS is likely a key component of the dataset they are working with.

In **section 2 (PK enhanced CSSRS dataset)**, the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created for suicidality assessment based on the CSSRS. They mention that they utilized a dataset from Gaur et al. (2021) that labels user posts from suicide-related subreddits. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of users and the types of labels assigned (Suicide Ideation, Suicide Behavior, Suicide Attempt).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used in their study is:

- For the dataset from Gaur et al.:
  > Manas Gaur, Vamsi Aribandi, Amanuel Alambo, Ugur Kursuncu, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Jonathan Beich, Jyotishman Pathak, and Amit Sheth. *Characterization of time-variant and time-invariant assessment of suicidality on reddit using c-ssrs*. PloS one, 16(5):e0250448, 2021.

Additionally, the authors reference the CSSRS itself, which is important for understanding the labeling process. The citation for the CSSRS is:

- For the CSSRS:
  > Johan Bjureberg, Marie Dahlin, Andreas Carlborg, Hanna Edberg, Axel Haglund, and Bo Runeson. *Columbia-suicide severity rating scale screen version: initial screening for suicide risk in a psychiatric emergency department*. Psychological medicine, pages 1â€“9, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
