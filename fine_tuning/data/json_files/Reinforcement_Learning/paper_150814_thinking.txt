To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information based explanation methods for deep learning agents – with applications on large open-source chess models" by Patrik Hammersborg and Inga Strümke, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of large open-source chess models, which suggests that there may be datasets related to chess involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data used for training or evaluation. The introduction references the Leela Chess Zero project, which is a community-driven initiative for training chess models. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this project.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments. The paper mentions using chess puzzles retrieved from Lichess (2020) and discusses the training of models using self-play games generated by the Leela Chess Zero initiative. This suggests that there are datasets related to both Lichess puzzles and self-play games.

Now, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention applying their trained model to chess puzzles from Lichess, which confirms that this dataset is relevant.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Lichess Puzzle Database**: The citation is:
   > Lichess. Lichess puzzle database, 2020. https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles, Last accessed on 2023-12-09.

2. **Leela Chess Zero**: The citation is:
   > Leela Zero Chess Development Community. Leela zero chess, 2018. https://lczero.org/, Last accessed on 2023-12-09.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
