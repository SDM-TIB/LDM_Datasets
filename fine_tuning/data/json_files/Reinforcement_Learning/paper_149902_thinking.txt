To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal and Multi-Factor Branching Time Active Inference (BT AI3M F)" by ThÃ©o Champion et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their approach on the **dSprites environment**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will check **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They specifically mention using the **dSprites dataset** for their evaluations. This section provides details about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments, confirming its significance.

In the **conclusion**, the authors reiterate the use of the dSprites dataset, emphasizing its role in their modeling and evaluation process. This further solidifies the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dSprites dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **dSprites dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the results section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Confirm the dataset's significance in the conclusion.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
