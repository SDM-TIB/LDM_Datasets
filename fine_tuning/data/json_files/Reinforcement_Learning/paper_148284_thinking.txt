To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Topical Expansion Framework for Unstructured Persona-oriented Dialogue Generation" by Minghong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention using two public multi-turn dialogue datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed included in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Persona-Chat Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,907 dialogues between pairs of speakers, with each speaker described by 3-5 persona sentences. The authors note that 968 dialogues are set aside for validation and 1,000 for testing.

2. **DailyDialog Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,118 multi-turn dialogues without persona descriptions, which are constructed from raw data crawled from various websites. The average number of turns is about 8, and the average number of tokens per utterance is approximately 15.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Persona-Chat Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, J., Galley, M., Brockett, C., Spithourakis, G., Gao, J., & Dolan, B. (2016). A persona-based neural conversation model. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 994–1003.

- For the **DailyDialog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 999–1007.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
