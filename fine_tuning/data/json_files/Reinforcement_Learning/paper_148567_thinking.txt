To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PC-PG: Policy Cover Directed Exploration for Provable Policy Gradient Learning" by Alekh Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors used to validate their proposed methods. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors usually detail the datasets used for empirical evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down the relevant information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
