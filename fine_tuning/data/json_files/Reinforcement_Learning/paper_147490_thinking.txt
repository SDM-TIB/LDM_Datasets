To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte Carlo Q-learning for General Game Playing" by Hui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the implementation of Q-learning in General Game Playing (GGP) and mentions three small-board games: **Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Hex**. This indicates that these games may serve as datasets for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the use of these games as datasets. In the text, the authors describe how they created a QPlayer to play Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Hex, and they provide results from these experiments. This confirms that these games are indeed the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will look for any specific references to the datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations. The paper does not provide formal dataset citations for the games themselves, as they are well-known games. However, I can still document them as datasets used in the context of the research.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classic two-player game where players take turns marking a space in a 3Ã—3 grid. The objective is to get three of one's own marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

2. **Connect Four**: A two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.

3. **Hex**: A two-player connection game played on a hexagonal grid. The objective is to connect opposite sides of the board with a continuous path of one's own pieces.

Since these games are widely recognized and do not have specific academic citations as datasets, I will note them as common datasets used in the context of reinforcement learning and game playing research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context in which they were used in the experiments, and prepare them for structured output.
