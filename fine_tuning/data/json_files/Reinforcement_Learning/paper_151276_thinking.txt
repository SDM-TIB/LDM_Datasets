To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Snapshot Reinforcement Learning: Leveraging Prior Trajectories for Efficiency" by Yanxiao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms and hints at the use of prior trajectories, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MuJoCo benchmark** for their experiments. This is a significant clue that a dataset is involved, but I need to find the specific datasets or environments they refer to.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experiments with various environments, specifically mentioning six MuJoCo environments: **Hopper-v4, Walker2d-v4, HalfCheetah-v4, Ant-v4, Swimmer-v4, and Humanoid-v4**. Each of these environments is a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning, indicating that they are indeed datasets used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these environments. The paper cites the following:

1. **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012. doi: 10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

2. **Gymnasium**: The citation for the Gymnasium library, which includes the MuJoCo environments, is:
   > Mark Towers, Jordan K. Terry, Ariel Kwiatkowski, John U. Balis, Gianluca de Cola, Tristan Deleu, Manuel Goulão, Andreas Kallinteris, Arjun KG, Markus Krimmel, Rodrigo Perez-Vicente, Andrea Pierré, Sander Schulhoff, Jun Jet Tai, Andrew Tan Jin Shen, and Omar G. Younis. *Gymnasium*, March 2023. URL https://zenodo.org/record/8127025.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries for the MuJoCo environments used in the experiments, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurately represented and properly cited.
