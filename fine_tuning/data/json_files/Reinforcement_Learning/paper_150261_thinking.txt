To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving self-supervised representation learning via sequential adversarial masking" by Dylan Sam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using multiple datasets for their experiments, specifically **ImageNet100s**, **STL10**, and **Pascal VOC**. I will take note of these datasets and look for detailed descriptions in the relevant sections.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results for classification tasks on **ImageNet100s** and **STL10**, and they also mention using **Pascal VOC** for semantic segmentation. I will gather the details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ImageNet100s**: This is a compressed version of the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the original ImageNet dataset is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael S. Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115:211–252, 2015.

2. **STL10**: The citation for the STL10 dataset is:
   > Marco Carlucci, Lorenzo Porzi, and Barbara Caputo. *STL10: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Unsupervised Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011.

3. **Pascal VOC**: The citation for the Pascal VOC dataset is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
