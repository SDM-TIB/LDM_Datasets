To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models" by Kiho Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail datasets, it can hint at their existence. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, purposes, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors mention using the **LLaMA-2 model** and refer to the **Big Analogy Test Set (BATS 3.0)** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and the number of concepts it includes.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or supplementary materials that may not have been included in the main text. The appendices often contain detailed tables or figures that can provide further insights into the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will look for their full citations in the **References section**. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will extract the relevant citations for the datasets mentioned.

For example, the citation for the **Big Analogy Test Set (BATS 3.0)** is:
> Gladkova, A., Drozd, A., & Matsuoka, S. (2016). *Analogy-based detection of morphological and semantic relations with word embeddings: what works and what doesn’t*. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop (pp. 8–15).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
