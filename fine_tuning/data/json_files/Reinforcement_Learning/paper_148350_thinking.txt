To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Perception and Representation for Robotic Manipulation" by Youssef Zaky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework and its application to a simulated grasping task, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that they applied their active perception and representation model to a benchmark simulated grasping task published in a prior work. This indicates that there may be a dataset associated with this benchmark.

I will look for any references to datasets in the **related work section** (Section II) as well, where they might cite previous studies that used specific datasets for similar tasks. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to a benchmark simulated grasping task published in a previous paper, specifically citing the work by Quillen et al. (2018) as the source of their experimental setup. This suggests that the dataset used for their experiments is linked to this prior work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset associated with the benchmark simulated grasping task. The relevant citation is:

- For the benchmark simulated grasping task:
  > D. Quillen, E. Jang, O. Nachum, C. Finn, J. Ibarz, and S. Levine. *Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Robotic Grasping: A Simulated Comparative Evaluation of Off-Policy Methods*. Tech. Rep. arXiv: 1802.10264v2, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the one associated with the Quillen et al. paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review.
