To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Modulation and Coding based on Reinforcement Learning for 5G Networks" by Mateus P. Mota et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a self-exploratory reinforcement learning framework but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section III (System Model)** and **section IV (Q-Learning Based AMC)**, as these sections often contain experimental setups and may reference datasets used for simulations or evaluations. However, upon reviewing these sections, it appears that the authors focus on simulation parameters and do not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section (V)**, where the authors describe their simulation results. They provide parameters and configurations for their simulations but again do not reference any external datasets. Instead, they discuss the performance of their proposed Q-learning based adaptive modulation and coding (QL-AMC) solution against baseline solutions.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily consist of papers discussing theoretical frameworks, algorithms, and methodologies related to reinforcement learning and adaptive modulation, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments; instead, they conducted simulations based on theoretical models and parameters. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

- No specific datasets were mentioned or utilized in the research paper.
- The authors focused on simulation parameters and theoretical models rather than empirical datasets.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of a research paper to identify any potential datasets, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such.
