To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Imitative Graph Representation Learning for Mobile User Profiling: An Adversarial Training Perspective" by Dongjie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Description section**, which is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on two check-in datasets from two cities: **New York** and **Beijing**. They provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of check-ins, POIs, and the time periods covered.

The paper states:
1. **New York Dataset**: Contains 227,428 check-ins and 38,334 POIs, covering the time period from April 2012 to February 2013.
2. **Beijing Dataset**: Contains 6,465 check-ins and 3,434 POIs, covering the time period from March 2011 to May 2011.

Additionally, the authors mention that they collected taxi order data from both cities for calculating temporal context, which includes 12,000,000 transactions for New York and 161,211,550 transactions for Beijing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **New York Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, D.; Zhang, D.; Zheng, V. W.; and Yu, Z. 2014. Modeling user activity preference by leveraging user spatial temporal characteristics in LBSNs. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems 45(1): 129–142.

- For the **Beijing Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
