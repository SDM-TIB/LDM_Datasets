To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Image Classifiers Using Contrastive Counterfactuals in Generative Latent Spaces" by Kamran Alipour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pretrained generative models and mentions the **CelebA dataset** as part of the experiments. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to document.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to find more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **CelebA dataset** for training their multi-task classifier, which provides 39 binary attributes for face images. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) (December 2015).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the CelebA dataset for my documentation.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets.
2. Check the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I will now create the dataset entry for the CelebA dataset.
