To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Batch Experience Replay" by Thibault Lahire et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, LaBER, yields improved performance over various Atari games and PyBullet environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any specific datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their empirical evaluations and mention that they ran experiments on **Atari games** and **PyBullet environments**. I will look for any specific names or references to datasets within these contexts.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** for Atari games and **PyBullet** for the physics simulation environments. These are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather platforms that provide a set of environments for reinforcement learning experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these platforms:

1. For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253–279.

2. For **PyBullet**, the citation is:
   > Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2016–2019). PyBullet, a Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning. Retrieved from http://pybullet.org.

Since these platforms serve as the basis for the datasets used in the experiments, I will include them in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured output of the datasets referenced in the paper.
