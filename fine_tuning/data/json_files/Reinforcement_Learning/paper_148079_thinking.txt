To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn How to Cook a New Recipe in a New House: Using Map Familiarization, Curriculum Learning, and Bandit Feedback to Learn Families of Text-Based Adventure Games" by Xusen Yin and Jonathan May, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep Q-learning strategies for text-based adventure games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe the games used for their experiments. They mention using games released by Microsoft for the "First TextWorld Problems" competition, specifically stating that they utilized **4,440 cooking games generated by the TextWorld framework**. This is a clear indication of a dataset.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset in this section. The authors describe the games as being divided into **222 different types**, with each type containing **20 games**. They provide information about the complexity of the games, including the number of ingredients and rooms, which helps to understand the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TextWorld framework, which is crucial for proper attribution. The relevant citation is:

- For the **TextWorld framework**, the citation is:
  > Cˆot´e, M.-A., K´ad´ar, ´A., Yuan, X., Kybartas, B., Barnes, T., Fine, E., Moore, J., Hausknecht, M. J., El Asri, L., Adada, M., Tay, W., & Trischler, A. (2018). Textworld: A learning environment for text-based games. CoRR, abs/1806.11532.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation for reference.
