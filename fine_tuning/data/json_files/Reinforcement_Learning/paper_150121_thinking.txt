To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid RL: Using Both Offline and Online Data Can Make RL Efficient" by Yuda Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using datasets for their experiments, specifically referring to "Montezuma’s Revenge" as a benchmark environment. This is a well-known dataset in the reinforcement learning community.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **related works section** or **appendices**, as these sections often provide additional context or references to datasets used in prior research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets:

1. **Montezuma’s Revenge**: This is an environment from the Arcade Learning Environment, which is commonly used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The authors mention that they adapted their algorithm to this environment and provide details about the dataset used for training and evaluation.

2. **Combination Lock**: The authors describe a synthetic environment called the combination lock, which they created for their experiments. They provide details about the structure of this environment, including the states and actions involved.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **Montezuma’s Revenge**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

- For the **Combination Lock**, since it is a synthetic environment created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source:
  > Song, Y., Zhou, Y., Sekhari, A., Bagnell, J. A., Krishnamurthy, A., & Sun, W. (2023). Hybrid RL: Using Both Offline and Online Data Can Make RL Efficient. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.01422*.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
