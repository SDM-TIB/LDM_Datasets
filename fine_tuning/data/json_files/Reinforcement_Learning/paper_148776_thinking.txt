To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Self-Imitation Learning with Hindsight" by Tianhong Dai, Hengyan Liu, and Anil Anthony Bharath, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its effectiveness in various simulated robot control tasks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors describe their experiments on several multi-goal environments, including the **Empty Room environment** and the **OpenAI Fetch environments**. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or environments that are used for training and evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on the **Empty Room environment**, which is a grid-world environment, and the **OpenAI Fetch environments**, which include tasks like FetchReach, FetchPush, FetchPickAndPlace, and FetchSlide. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations for these environments, as they are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe these environments. The **OpenAI Fetch environments** are commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I will look for the original papers that introduced these environments.

For the **Empty Room environment**, it is a toy example and may not have a formal citation, as it is often used for illustrative purposes in reinforcement learning research.

For the **OpenAI Fetch environments**, I will find the relevant citation:
- The Fetch environments are detailed in the paper:
  > Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity. 

In summary, the datasets identified from the paper are:
1. **Empty Room environment**: A toy grid-world environment, no formal citation.
2. **OpenAI Fetch environments**: 
   - Citation: Plappert et al. (2018) for the Fetch environments.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation.
