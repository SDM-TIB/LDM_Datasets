To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transductive Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization" by Yaozhong Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **six representative tasks across the MuJoCo environments** and **Atari games** for their experiments. I will need to identify the specific datasets or environments they refer to.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Based on the content of the paper, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **MuJoCo environments**: The authors mention using several continuous control tasks from the MuJoCo environments. The specific tasks are not named in the abstract or introduction, but they are likely detailed in the experiments section.

2. **Atari games**: The authors also mention conducting experiments on various Atari games. Again, the specific games used should be detailed in the experiments section.

Now, I will look for the full citations for the MuJoCo environments and Atari games in the references. The citation for the MuJoCo environments is:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

For the Atari games, the citation is typically referenced as part of the OpenAI Gym:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
