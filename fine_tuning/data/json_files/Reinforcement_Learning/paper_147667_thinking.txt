To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FPGA Architecture for Deep Learning and its application to Planetary Robotics" by Pranay Reddy Gankidi and Jekan Thangavelautham, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the implementation of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on FPGA, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. The introduction mentions the use of machine learning algorithms in space missions but does not specify any datasets.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for testing their FPGA architecture. The results section primarily focuses on performance metrics and comparisons between different architectures, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

Since the paper does not seem to explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the research. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and neural networks, but I need to determine if any of these papers provide datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that some of the cited works may have associated datasets. For example, I will check the following references for potential datasets:

1. **Reference [4]**: Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (1998). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. This book may discuss datasets used in reinforcement learning contexts.
2. **Reference [6]**: Mnih, V., et al. (2013). *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. This paper is known for using the Atari game environment, which could be a dataset for reinforcement learning tasks.

I will compile the full citations for any datasets I identify from these references. If I find specific datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations in the final output.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset I extract.
