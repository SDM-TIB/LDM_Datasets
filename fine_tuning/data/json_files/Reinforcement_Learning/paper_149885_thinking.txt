To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Voice Instructions in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Self-Driving Cars" by Mingze Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that this simulator might be a key dataset or environment used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention collecting voice instructions and building a training dataset, which indicates that there is a specific dataset created for their research.

In the **Methodology** section, the authors describe the process of collecting voice instructions from participants, which leads me to identify the following dataset:

1. **Voice Instruction Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of voice instructions given by machine learning practitioners while observing self-driving car agents. The dataset includes 20 audio clips that were transcribed into text and annotated for further analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **CARLA simulator**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of autonomous driving.

The full citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset identified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
