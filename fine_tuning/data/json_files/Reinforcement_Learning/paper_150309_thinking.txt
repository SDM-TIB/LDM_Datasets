To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated deep reinforcement learning for real-time scheduling strategy of multi-energy system integrated with post-carbon and direct-air carbon captured system" by Tobi Michael Alabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **real-time multi-energy data of a district in Arizona, the United States**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the integration of carbon capture technologies and mention the use of **multi-energy load and weather data** from a specific time period (January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017). This is a strong indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In the **case study section**, the authors specify that the data was retrieved from the **Building Data Genome Project 2 (BDGPII)** database. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the source of the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> S. D. C. Team. Metadata record for: The Building Data Genome Project 2, energy meter data from the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition, 26-Oct-2020, doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.13033847.v1.

Additionally, the authors mention that solar radiation data and wind speed measurements were obtained from the **Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS)** website. I will look for the citation for this source as well.

The citation for the CAMS data is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will note that it is necessary to visit the CAMS website to retrieve the appropriate citation.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Multi-energy load and weather data** from the **Building Data Genome Project 2 (BDGPII)**:
   - Citation: S. D. C. Team. Metadata record for: The Building Data Genome Project 2, energy meter data from the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III competition, 26-Oct-2020, doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.13033847.v1.

2. **Solar radiation data and wind speed measurements** from the **Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS)**:
   - Citation: (To be retrieved from the CAMS website).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
