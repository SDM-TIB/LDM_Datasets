To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-like Energy Management Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Historical Driving Experiences" by Teng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "collected historical driving data," which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section III (DRL Algorithm and Expert Knowledge)**, where the authors describe the collection of historical driving data from experienced drivers. They mention that the data includes vehicle velocity, acceleration, travel distance, GPS data, and other parameters collected over a significant period (1320 days, 3885 times, and 45384 km). This suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

In **section III.B (Historical Driving Experiences)**, the authors provide details about the dataset collection process, including the types of data collected and the context in which it was gathered. This section confirms the existence of a dataset that is crucial for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a study conducted in Beijing, China, which is cited as:

- For the historical driving dataset:
  > Qingkai Yang, “Study of the driving cycle of electric vehicles in Beijing,” Master Dissertation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Jun. 2017. (in Chinese)

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
