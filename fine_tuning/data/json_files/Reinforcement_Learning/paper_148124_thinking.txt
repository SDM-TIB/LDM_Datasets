To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Transform Experience Replay: Data Augmentation for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Yijiong Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of the Fetch tasks from OpenAI Gym, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific datasets mentioned. The introduction emphasizes the challenges in deep reinforcement learning and mentions the use of experience replay, but it does not introduce new datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will focus on the details provided in **section V (Experiments and Results)**. Here, the authors describe the environments used for evaluation, specifically mentioning three tasks: **pushing**, **sliding**, and **pick-and-place**. These tasks are part of the **OpenAI Gym** framework, which is a well-known dataset for reinforcement learning tasks.

In the **appendices**, I will check for any additional datasets or specific configurations related to the tasks. The paper mentions that the tasks are set up in a simulated environment using OpenAI Gym, which confirms that the datasets are derived from this framework.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym Fetch tasks**: The citation for the OpenAI Gym framework is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper primarily utilizes the OpenAI Gym framework for its experiments, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
