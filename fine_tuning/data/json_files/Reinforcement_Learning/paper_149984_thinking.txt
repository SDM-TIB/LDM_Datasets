To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Counterfactuals via Functional Mechanism" by Fan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed framework on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors provide data statistics for the datasets used in their evaluations. In Table 1, they list six datasets along with their characteristics:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used for annual income prediction, containing 48,842 instances with 24 features and 2 classes.
2. **Hospital Dataset**: This dataset contains information on diabetic patients from 101,766 instances with 127 features and 2 classes.
3. **HomeCredit Dataset**: This dataset is for client risk assessment, consisting of 344,971 instances with 39 features and 2 classes.
4. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 70,000 instances with 28x28 pixel features and 10 classes.
5. **Purchase Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict customer responses to offers, containing 197,324 instances with 600 features and 100 classes.
6. **Texas Dataset**: This dataset contains patient status information from 65,761 instances with 3,622 features and 100 classes.

I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide specific citations for all datasets, especially if they are well-known or publicly available datasets. However, I will ensure to include citations for those that are referenced.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on common knowledge and existing literature:

- **Texas Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use.
