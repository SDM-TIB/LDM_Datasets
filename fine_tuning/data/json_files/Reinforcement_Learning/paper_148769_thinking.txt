To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving The Lunar Lander Problem under Uncertainty using Reinforcement Learning" by Soham Gadgil et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of reinforcement learning techniques on OpenAI Gymâ€™s LunarLander-v2 environment, which suggests that this environment is a key dataset for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The paper describes the LunarLander-v2 environment as part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit, which is crucial for the experiments conducted. This indicates that the LunarLander-v2 environment is the primary dataset used in the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the dataset used. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or benchmarks, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LunarLander-v2 Environment**: This is the main dataset used for the experiments, which is part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary citation into a structured format for further processing.
