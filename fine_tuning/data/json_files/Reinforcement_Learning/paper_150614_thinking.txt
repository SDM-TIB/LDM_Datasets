To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Time Analysis of Minimax Q-Learning for Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games: Switching System Approach" by Donghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, or references to existing datasets.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions, including the purpose of each dataset, the number of samples, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "OpenAI Gym" dataset for their experiments, I would look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I may need to look up the dataset online to find the appropriate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
