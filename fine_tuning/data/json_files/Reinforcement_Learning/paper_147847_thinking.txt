To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Deep Q-learning with Demonstration" by Si-An Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of expert demonstrations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the text.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups. If the authors describe the environments used for evaluation, such as "Cart-Pole," "Acrobot," "Mountain Car," and "Lunar Lander," I will take note of these as they are likely to be the datasets or environments used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "OpenAI Gym" environments, I will find the citation for the OpenAI Gym paper, which is:
> Brockman G, Cheung V, Pettersson L, Schneider J, Schulman J, Tang J, Zaremba W. *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR abs/1606.01540, 2016.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of reinforcement learning or demonstrations, ensuring I capture their full citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets and their descriptions in the experiments section.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information for structured output.
