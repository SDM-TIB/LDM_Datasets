To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Discounting of Training Time Attacks" by Ridhima Bector et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. If the abstract references any datasets, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**. This section often discusses the context of the research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that utilized datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology section**. This section typically outlines the experimental setup and may provide detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will extract any relevant details about the datasets from this section.

Following that, I will check the **experiments section**. This section usually describes the experiments conducted and may reiterate the datasets used, providing additional context or results related to those datasets. I will ensure to capture any specific metrics or outcomes associated with the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions a dataset like the "3D Grid World" used for experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is from another paper, I will ensure to include that paper's citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper, complete with proper citations.
