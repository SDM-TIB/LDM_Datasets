To extract datasets from the research paper titled "K-percent Evaluation for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning" by Golnaz Mesbahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new evaluation methodology for lifelong reinforcement learning agents, which may imply the use of specific datasets for testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention several environments and tasks used for their experiments, which may correspond to specific datasets or benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets or environments. The authors refer to environments such as **Non-stationary Catch**, **Continuing Cart-pole**, and **Jelly Bean World**. I will note these down as they are likely to be the datasets or environments used for evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these environments. The paper cites the following:

1. **Non-stationary Catch**: 
   > Google-Deepmind. GitHub - google-deepmind/csuite, 2022.

2. **Continuing Cart-pole**: 
   > Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., & Anderson, C. W. (1983). Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems. *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics*, 13(5), 834-846.

3. **Jelly Bean World**: 
   > Platanios, E. A., Saparov, A., & Mitchell, T. (2020). Jelly bean world: A testbed for never-ending learning. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
