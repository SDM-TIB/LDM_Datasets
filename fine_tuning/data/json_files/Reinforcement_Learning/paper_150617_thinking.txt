To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Models" by Bernhard Jaeger, Kashyap Chitta, and Andreas Geiger, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors developed a method that ranks first on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks, which suggests that these benchmarks may involve specific datasets.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention training on **CARLA towns 01, 03, 04, 06, 07, and 10**, and evaluating on the **16 validation routes from LAV** in withheld towns 02 and 05. This indicates that CARLA is a significant dataset used in their work.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets that are commonly used in the field of autonomous driving. They mention several methods and benchmarks, including LAV and Longest6, which may have associated datasets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **CARLA**: The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
   > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

2. **Longest6 Benchmark**: The authors refer to the Longest6 benchmark, which is part of the CARLA leaderboard. The specific citation for the benchmark may not be provided in the references, but it is associated with the CARLA simulator.

3. **LAV Benchmark**: The citation for the LAV benchmark is:
   > Dian Chen and Philipp Krähenbühl. *Learning from all vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
