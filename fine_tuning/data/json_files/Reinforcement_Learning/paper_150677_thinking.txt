To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Edge of Stability Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning" by Rares Iordan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments using specific environments, which may imply the use of datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **MinAtar**, a testbed for reinforcement learning experiments, which includes several Atari games. They specifically refer to datasets for **Breakout** and **Space Invaders**. 

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The paper states that datasets for Breakout and Space Invaders are available, but I need to ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets.

1. **MinAtar**: The citation for the MinAtar testbed is:
   > Kenny Young and Tian Tian. *Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for more efficient reinforcement learning experiments*. CoRR, abs/1903.03176, 2019. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03176.

2. **Breakout and Space Invaders**: While the paper does not provide separate citations for these specific games, they are part of the MinAtar framework. Therefore, the citation for MinAtar serves as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments involving these games.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
