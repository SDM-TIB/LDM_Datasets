To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cyclical Approach to Synthetic and Natural Speech Mismatch Refinement of Neural Post-filter for Low-cost Text-to-speech System" by Yi-Chiao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the corpus used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using an **internal Japanese corpus** that includes a female and a male speaker, with specific details about the number of training and testing utterances. This indicates that there is a dataset involved.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional datasets or external data sources that may have been used for training or validation purposes. The authors mention using external data from the **VCTK corpus**, which is relevant for understanding the robustness of their model.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Internal Japanese Corpus**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, as it is an internal resource. However, I will note the details: it consists of 800 training utterances and 100 testing utterances from two speakers.

2. **VCTK Corpus**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yamagishi, J., Veaux, C., & MacDonald, K. (2019). CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92). [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2645

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
