To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms: Research Direction and Survey" by Rohit Kumar Sachan and Dharmender Singh Kushwaha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on nature-inspired algorithms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section often contains citations to other works that may have utilized specific datasets.

I will then look into the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss specific algorithms and their applications. For instance, if the authors mention experiments or evaluations of the algorithms, they might reference datasets used for those evaluations.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

If the paper does not provide specific datasets but discusses various algorithms and their applications, I will note that as well, indicating that while the algorithms are well-documented, no specific datasets were utilized in the experiments described.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if available. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets related to the research discussed in the paper.
