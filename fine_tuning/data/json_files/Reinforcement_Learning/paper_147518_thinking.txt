To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why the Firefly Algorithm Works?" by Xin-She Yang and Xing-shi He, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and experiments**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the firefly algorithm and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section** (Section 6), as this is where the authors are likely to discuss specific datasets used in their experiments or applications of the firefly algorithm. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the context of the firefly algorithm.

Upon reviewing Section 6, I find several applications mentioned, but I need to determine if any specific datasets are cited. For example, the authors mention applications in areas such as energy systems, image processing, and optimization problems. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or details in this section.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the main sections, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets. I will look for papers that are known to provide datasets or that might have been used in conjunction with the firefly algorithm.

After reviewing the references, I find that several cited works may involve datasets, but I need to ensure that they are relevant to the firefly algorithm's applications discussed in the paper. I will compile the relevant citations for any datasets that are mentioned in the context of the firefly algorithm.

For example, if I find a reference to a dataset used in a cited paper, I will document it as follows:

- If a dataset is mentioned in a paper by Ghorbani et al. regarding gas flow rates, I will note that dataset and provide the full citation:
  > Ghorbani, H., Moghadasi, J., Wood, D.A., Prediction of gas flow rates from gas condensate reservoirs through wellhead chokes using a firefly optimization algorithm, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 45, 256â€“271 (2017).

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset I identify, as this is crucial for proper documentation and future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights.
2. Focus on the applications section for any dataset mentions.
3. Review the references for any relevant datasets used in cited works.
4. Document each dataset with its full citation.

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets referenced in the paper, along with their citations, ready for further processing or review.
