To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning of Markov Decision Processes with Peak Constraints" by Ather Gattami, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context of reinforcement learning and peak constraints but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results sections** (if present) for any mention of datasets used in the research. In this paper, there are no dedicated sections labeled as "Datasets" or "Experiments" that explicitly list datasets. Instead, the paper focuses on theoretical formulations and algorithms without empirical validation using specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets or references to datasets used in experiments, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. However, the references primarily consist of literature on reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes, without specific datasets being highlighted.

Given that the paper does not mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper and provide a note indicating the absence of dataset references.
