To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverb: A Framework for Experience Replay" by Albin Cassirer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of experience data in Reinforcement Learning (RL) but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also emphasizes the role of experience in RL but does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Examples)**, as this section often contains practical applications and may reference datasets used in experiments. In this case, the examples provided focus on the implementation of the Reverb framework rather than specific datasets.

I will also check the **performance section (section 5)** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of benchmarking the Reverb system. However, this section primarily discusses the performance characteristics of the Reverb framework without naming specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works or related research. The references include various papers and resources related to reinforcement learning but do not explicitly mention any datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or cited in the text. Therefore, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. If I were to find datasets in a different paper, I would follow a similar approach: identify sections where datasets are likely to be mentioned, extract their details, and then look for full citations in the references section to ensure proper documentation.
