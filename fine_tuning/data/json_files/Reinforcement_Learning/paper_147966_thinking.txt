To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning using Genetic Algorithm for Parameter Optimization" by Adarsh Sehgal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the application of the method to various robotic manipulation tasks, it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experiment and Results)**, where the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. They mention five specific robotic manipulation tasks: **FetchReach-v1, FetchSlide-v1, FetchPush-v1, FetchPick&Place-v1, and DoorOpening**. This indicates that these tasks are likely associated with specific datasets or environments used for evaluation.

In the same section, the authors provide visual results and comparisons of their algorithm's performance across these tasks. However, they do not provide explicit dataset citations or detailed descriptions of the datasets used for these tasks. Therefore, I will need to look for any references to these datasets in the **References section** of the paper.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I will search for any papers or sources that describe the datasets corresponding to the mentioned tasks. For instance, the environments used for robotic manipulation tasks are often derived from established benchmarks or simulation environments. I will look for citations that may refer to these environments.

After identifying the relevant citations, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors used the **OpenAI Gym** environments for their experiments, I would include the citation for the OpenAI Gym paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I document each dataset with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research. If the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will note that and suggest looking up the environments mentioned for their respective sources.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Focus on the experimental section to identify specific tasks and environments.
3. Check the references for citations related to the datasets or environments used.
4. Compile full citations for each identified dataset or environment.
5. Document the findings clearly for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
