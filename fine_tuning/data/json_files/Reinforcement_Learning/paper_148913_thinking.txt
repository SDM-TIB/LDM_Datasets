To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering Terra Mystica: Applying Self-Play to Multi-agent Cooperative Board Games" by Luis Perez, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of algorithms to the game Terra Mystica but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will note this and move on.

Next, I will examine the **experimental approach and results sections**. These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the author discusses the performance of AI agents in self-play and compares them to human scores, but there is no mention of specific datasets or publicly available data.

I will also check the **background and overview sections** for any references to datasets. The paper focuses on the game mechanics and algorithms rather than on datasets, which suggests that the author may not have used external datasets but rather simulated game scenarios.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will look at the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of papers related to AI and game theory, but they do not point to specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets or references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper "Mastering Terra Mystica: Applying Self-Play to Multi-agent Cooperative Board Games" by Luis Perez, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
