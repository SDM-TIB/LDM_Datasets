To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Load Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm to Improve the Load Profile" by Farhat Iqbal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on load scheduling and mentions the use of a genetic algorithm, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of matching demand and generation in electrical power systems but does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology and results sections**, I will look for any tables or figures that might contain data relevant to the study. In the results section, I find **Table 1**, which lists electrical load ratings and specifications for different types of appliances (necessary load, consistent load, and inconsistent load). This table provides valuable data but does not reference an external dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of studies and articles that discuss methodologies and algorithms related to load scheduling and demand response, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any external datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that the data presented in the paper is derived from the authors' own simulations and calculations rather than from publicly available datasets.

In summary, while I have identified internal data (like the load specifications in Table 1), there are no external datasets cited in the paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are referenced.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
