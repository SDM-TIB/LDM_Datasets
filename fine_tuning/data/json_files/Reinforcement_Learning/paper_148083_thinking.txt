To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Play the Chess Variant Crazyhouse Above World Champion Level with Deep Neural Networks and Human Data" by Johannes Czech et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors trained their model on **569,537 human games**, which indicates a significant dataset. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In **section 7 (Training Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets:

1. **Lichess Human Games Dataset**: This dataset consists of **569,537 human games** played on lichess.org from January 2016 to June 2018. The authors mention that these games were played by users with an Elo rating of 2,000 or higher, and they include various game outcomes such as checkmate, resignation, and time forfeits.

2. **Stockfish Self-Play Dataset**: This dataset includes **121,571 games** generated by the Stockfish chess engine through self-play. The authors note that this dataset was used to further train a version of their model called CrazyAraFish.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources (lichess.org and Stockfish), I will provide the citations based on the information available:

- For the **Lichess Human Games Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lichess.org. *Lichess Database*. Available at: https://database.lichess.org/. Accessed on: July 30, 2019.

- For the **Stockfish Self-Play Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stockfish. *Stockfish Chess Engine*. Available at: https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish. Accessed on: July 30, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
