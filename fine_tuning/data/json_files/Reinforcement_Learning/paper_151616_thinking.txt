To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System" by Amine Tellache et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments using the **CIC-IDS-2017 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they evaluated their proposed intrusion detection system using the **CIC-IDS-2017 dataset** and describe its characteristics, such as its highly imbalanced class distribution and the preprocessing steps taken.

In the **dataset preprocessing section**, they provide additional context about the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, including its total number of instances and the breakdown of classes. This confirms that the dataset is indeed the primary one used for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **CIC-IDS-2017**, the citation is:
  > I. Sharafaldin, A. H. Lashkari, and A. A. Ghorbani. "Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization." In Proceedings of the ICISSP, vol. 1, pp. 108â€“116, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **CIC-IDS-2017 Dataset**: This dataset is a labeled network traffic dataset that includes advanced contemporary attack techniques. It exhibits a highly imbalanced class distribution, with the majority of instances classified as benign, while certain attack classes have a significantly limited number of instances.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for reference.
