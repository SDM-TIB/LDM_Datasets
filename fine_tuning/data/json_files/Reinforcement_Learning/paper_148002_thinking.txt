To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Existence Determination Through Policy Optimization" by Baoxiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experimental analysis is conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find explicit mentions of datasets. In **Section 4.1**, the authors describe the **Stained MNIST** dataset, which is a modified version of the original MNIST dataset. The paper explains how this dataset was constructed, including the resizing and modification processes. This is a clear indication that I need to document this dataset.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors mention using a dataset for **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening**, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The paper references the dataset but does not provide a specific name, so I will need to look up the Kaggle competition to find the exact dataset name and citation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Stained MNIST**: Since this dataset is derived from the original MNIST dataset, I will cite the original MNIST paper:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset**: For the DR screening dataset, I will cite the Kaggle competition:
   > Kaggle. *Diabetic Retinopathy Detection*. [https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to create a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.
