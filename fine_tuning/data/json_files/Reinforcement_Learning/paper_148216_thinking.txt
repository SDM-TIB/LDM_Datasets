To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Q-Learning and Search with Amortized Value Estimates" by Jessica B. Hamrick et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which often includes the datasets used for training and evaluation.

I will also look for a dedicated **datasets** section, if available, where the authors might provide a comprehensive list of datasets along with their descriptions. If such a section is not present, I will gather information from the **results** and **discussion** sections, where the authors may refer to specific datasets used in their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down the full citations for each dataset as provided in the **references** section of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari Learning Environment** for experiments, I would look for the citation in the references, which is typically formatted as follows:

- For the Atari Learning Environment:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
