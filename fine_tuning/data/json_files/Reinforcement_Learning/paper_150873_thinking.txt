To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REWARD MODEL ENSEMBLES HELP MITIGATE OVEROPTIMIZATION" by Thomas Coste et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and mentions the use of learned reward models, but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **Alpaca dataset** and its variant, **AlpacaFarm**. The Alpaca dataset is described as containing 52,000 instructions generated by OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, while AlpacaFarm provides splits for different RLHF stages and includes human preference annotations.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section**. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **Alpaca dataset**, the citation is:
   > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following llama model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

2. For the **AlpacaFarm dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Rohan Taori, Tianyi Zhang, Ishaan Gulrajani, Jimmy Ba, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Alpacafarm: A simulation framework for methods that learn from human feedback*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14387, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Alpaca dataset**: A dataset containing 52,000 instructions covering a range of commands and corresponding demonstrations generated by OpenAI’s text-davinci-003.

2. **AlpacaFarm dataset**: A variant of the Alpaca dataset that provides splits for different RLHF stages and includes human preference annotations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and ready for any further processing or review.
