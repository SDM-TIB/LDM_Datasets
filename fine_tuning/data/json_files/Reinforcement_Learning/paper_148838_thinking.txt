To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Policy for Pre-trained Deep Reinforcement Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition" by Thejan Rajapakshe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **IEMOCAP** and **SAVEE** datasets for evaluation, which is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **Methodology** section, particularly the **Dataset** subsection, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **IEMOCAP Dataset**: This dataset consists of five sessions of speech segments from two speakers, labeled with nine emotional categories. However, the authors focus on four emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral, with a maximum of 1,200 segments taken from each emotion for balanced representation.

2. **SAVEE Dataset**: This smaller dataset is collected from four male speakers and contains eight emotion labels, but the authors filter it down to the same four emotions for consistency with IEMOCAP.

In the **Experimental Setup** section, the authors provide further context on how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IEMOCAP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 42(4), 335-359. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-008-9076-6

- For the **SAVEE Dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
