To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization of Agent Behavior through Explicit Representation of Context" by Cem Tutum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the approach is evaluated in several game environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or environments used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the need for robust performance in unseen situations, but I need to look for specific names of datasets or environments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under **2.1 Experimental Domains**, the authors describe three environments used for evaluation:

1. **Flappy Bird**: An extension of the popular Flappy Bird game, which serves as a testing ground for the agent's performance.
2. **LunarLander-v2**: A modified version of the LunarLander environment from OpenAI Gym, which is used to evaluate the agent's landing capabilities.
3. **CARLA**: An open-source autonomous driving simulation environment, which is used to assess the agent's driving performance under various conditions.

These environments are crucial for understanding the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments:

- For **Flappy Bird**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia. 2020. *Flappy Bird*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird. Accessed 3-February-2020.

- For **LunarLander-v2**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Shinn, J., and Schulman, J. 2016. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01583.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, A., Codevilla, F., Driess, C., and M. A. 2017. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. arXiv:1711.03938.

Now that I have identified the datasets (or environments) and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
