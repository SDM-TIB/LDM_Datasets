To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Go-Explore: a New Approach for Hard-Exploration Problems" by Adrien Ecoffet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions two Atari games, **Montezuma’s Revenge** and **Pitfall**, as benchmarks for hard-exploration problems, indicating that these games are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets or data sources. In the methodology, the authors describe the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a framework that includes various Atari games, including the two mentioned earlier. This suggests that the datasets are derived from the gameplay of these Atari games.

In the **results** section, the authors provide performance metrics for the two games, confirming that they are indeed the datasets used for their experiments. They report scores achieved by their algorithm on both **Montezuma’s Revenge** and **Pitfall**, which further solidifies their role as datasets in this research.

Now, I will look at the **references** section to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the games themselves, as they are well-known benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community. However, I can still provide the general references for the Arcade Learning Environment, which encompasses these games.

The citations I will include are:

1. **Montezuma’s Revenge**:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. **Pitfall**:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since both games are part of the same environment, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
