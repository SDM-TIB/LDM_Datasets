To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph-of-Entity: A General Model for Entity-Oriented Search" by José Devezas and Sérgio Nunes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. In this case, the authors mention using the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **materials and methods** section. In this paper, section 3.1 specifically discusses the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection** in detail. It describes the dataset as a snapshot of the English Wikipedia from October 8, 2008, containing over 2.6 million articles and providing relevance judgments for various retrieval tasks. This section confirms that the INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection is indeed the primary dataset used in the research.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any specific details about how the INEX 2009 dataset was utilized in the experiments. However, the paper primarily focuses on this single dataset for the tasks of ad hoc document retrieval, ad hoc entity retrieval, and entity list completion.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Ralf Schenkel, Fabian M. Suchanek, and Gjergji Kasneci. *YAWN: A Semantically Annotated Wikipedia XML Corpus*. In Datenbanksysteme in Business, Technologie und Web (BTW 2007), 12. Fachtagung des GI-Fachbereichs "Datenbanken und Informationssysteme" (DBIS), Proceedings, 7.-9. März 2007, Aachen, Germany. 277–291. http://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings103/article1404.html

After compiling this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying the dedicated datasets section and extracting details about the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection**.
3. Confirming the dataset's use in the experiments and gathering the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am now ready to create the dataset entry for the INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection.
