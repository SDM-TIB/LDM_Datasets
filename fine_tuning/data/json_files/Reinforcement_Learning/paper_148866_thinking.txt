To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel Estimation via Successive Denoising in MIMO OFDM Systems: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Myeung Suk Oh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail experimental setups or data collection processes. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods.

After that, I will check the **results** section, where the authors typically present their findings. They may refer to specific datasets when discussing the performance of their proposed method compared to existing techniques.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

As I go through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. I will also ensure to document the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly attributed to its source.
