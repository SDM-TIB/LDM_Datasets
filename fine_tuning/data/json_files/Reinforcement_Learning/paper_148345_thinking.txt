To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating and Improving AlphaZero Using Population Based Training" by Ti-Rong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of AlphaZero in games like Go, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about AlphaZero and its applications but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. The authors mention conducting experiments on **9x9 Go** and **19x19 Go**, which indicates that these games serve as the experimental environments. However, I need to confirm if there are specific datasets associated with these experiments.

In the **experiments** section, the authors describe the training process for both the 9x9 and 19x19 Go games. They mention generating self-play records and using a population of agents, but they do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, the data used for training appears to be generated internally through self-play, which is a common practice in reinforcement learning.

Since there are no external datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will note that the experiments rely on self-generated data from the AlphaZero training process.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the absence of external datasets in the paper, ensuring to document that the experiments utilized self-play data rather than traditional datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings into a structured format that reflects the lack of external datasets while acknowledging the self-play data used in the experiments.
