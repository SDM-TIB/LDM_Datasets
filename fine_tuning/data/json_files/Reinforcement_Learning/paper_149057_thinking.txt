To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting to Reward Progressivity via Spectral Reinforcement Learning" by Michael Dann and John Thangarajah, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this paper, the authors mention applying their method to **six standard Atari games**. I will look for specific names of these games, as they are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the games they tested their method on. The games mentioned are:

1. **Ponglantis**: A modified version of the classic Pong game designed to exhibit strong reward progressivity.
2. **Exponential Pong**: Another variant of Pong where rewards are exponentially scaled based on the player's score.
3. **Bowling**: A standard Atari game where players aim to knock down pins.
4. **Centipede**: A classic arcade game where players shoot at a centipede descending the screen.
5. **Ms. Pacman**: A well-known arcade game where players navigate a maze and eat pellets while avoiding ghosts.
6. **Video Pinball**: A pinball simulation game that includes various scoring mechanisms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the original papers or sources for these games. The Atari games are well-documented, so I can use standard citations for them:

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Dabney, W., & Munos, R. (2017). A distributional perspective on reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), volume 70, pp. 449â€“458.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
