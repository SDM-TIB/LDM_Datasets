To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Policy Value Monte Carlo Tree Search" by Li-Cheng Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new method called MPV-MCTS and mentions experiments conducted on the game NoGo, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find specific references to datasets. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they trained their networks using a dataset of **200,000 games** generated by the HaHaNoGo program. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from self-play games.

I will also check the **background section** (section 2) to see if there are any references to datasets used in prior works that might be relevant. However, the primary focus will be on the datasets mentioned in the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors state that the dataset consists of **about 107 positions** generated by HaHaNoGo with **50,000 simulations for each move**. This provides a clear description of the dataset used for training.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the HaHaNoGo program mentioned in the references. The citation is as follows:
> Li-Cheng Lan. *HaHaNoGo: An open source NoGo program*. https://github.com/lclan1024/HaHaNoGo, 2016.

This citation will be important to include when documenting the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the HaHaNoGo dataset. The dataset entry will clearly describe the dataset's purpose, size, and source, adhering to the required format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
