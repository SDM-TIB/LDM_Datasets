To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constraint Sampling Reinforcement Learning: Incorporating Expertise For Faster Learning" by Tong Mu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In the experiments section, the authors describe four environments where their algorithm is evaluated. I will extract the relevant datasets associated with each environment:

1. **MovieLens 100K Dataset**: This dataset is used in the recommendation system environment. It contains 100,000 user-movie ratings across 1,000 users. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens datasets: History and context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

2. **ASSISTment 2009-2010 Dataset**: This dataset is used in the educational activities sequencing environment. It contains data from 3,274 students over 407,000 student-problem interactions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Feng, M., Heffernan, N., & Koedinger, K. (2009). Addressing the assessment challenge with an online system that tutors as it assesses. *User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction*, 19(3), 243-266.

3. **HIV Treatment Simulator**: This simulator is based on real data and simulates a patientâ€™s response to different types of treatments. The original papers that describe this simulator are:
   > Adams, B. M., Banks, H. T., Kwon, H.-D., & Tran, H. T. (2004). Dynamic multidrug therapies for HIV: Optimal and STI control approaches. *Mathematical Biosciences & Engineering*, 1(2), 223-238.
   > Ernst, D., Stan, G.-B., Goncalves, J., & Wehenkel, L. (2006). Clinical data based optimal STI strategies for HIV: A reinforcement learning approach. In *Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control*, 667-672.

4. **Lunar Lander Environment**: This environment is based on the OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander simulator. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset, ready for review or downstream processing.
