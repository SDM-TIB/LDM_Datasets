To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous CRM Control via CLV Approximation with Deep Reinforcement Learning in Discrete and Continuous Action Space" by Yegor Tkachenko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experimental results are based on the **KDD Cup 1998 mailing dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the dataset. The introduction discusses the challenges in direct marketing and mentions the use of historical data, but it primarily reiterates the importance of the KDD Cup dataset.

In the **experimental results section**, the author explicitly states that they used the **1998 KDD Cup competition mailing data**. This section provides further details about the dataset, including the number of clients (95,412) and the nature of the data collected (donation-seeking mailings over 23 distinct periods). This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KDD Cup dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Parsa, I., Howes, K. (1998). *KDD Cup 1998 mailing dataset*. http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/13/511C71F8612C3.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **KDD Cup 1998 Mailing Dataset**: This dataset includes records of donation-seeking mailings to 95,412 clients over 23 distinct periods, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Parsa, I., Howes, K. (1998). *KDD Cup 1998 mailing dataset*. http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/13/511C71F8612C3.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset details in the required format for further processing or review.
