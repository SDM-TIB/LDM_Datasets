To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A deep learning model for segmentation of geographic atrophy to study its long-term natural history" by Bart Liefers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **409 color fundus images (CFIs) from the Rotterdam Study (RS) and the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES)** for model development, and **5,379 CFIs from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)** for analyzing GA growth rate. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they explicitly state that the data for developing and evaluating the model were collected from the **BMES** and **RS** cohorts, and that the model was applied to the **AREDS** dataset for assessing GA growth rate. This confirms the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

I will then summarize the datasets:

1. **Rotterdam Study (RS)**: This is a population study that included 7,983 participants aged 55 years and older, with CFIs obtained over multiple cohorts. The paper states that **322 images from RS** were used for model development.

2. **Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES)**: This study included 3,654 participants aged 49 or older, and the paper mentions that **87 images from BMES** were used for model development.

3. **Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)**: This long-term study enrolled 4,757 participants aged between 55 and 80 years, and the authors used **5,379 images from AREDS** for analyzing GA growth rate.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Rotterdam Study (RS)**, the citation is:
  > Ikram MA, Brusselle GG, Murad SD, et al. The Rotterdam Study: 2018 update on objectives, design and main results. *Eur J Epidemiol*. 2017;32:807-850.

- For the **Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES)**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P, Smith W, Attebo K, et al. Prevalence of age-related maculopathy in Australia. *Ophthalmology*. 1995;102:1450-1460.

- For the **Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
