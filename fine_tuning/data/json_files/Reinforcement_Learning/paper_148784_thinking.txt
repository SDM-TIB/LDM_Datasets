To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NOMA in UAV-aided cellular offloading: A machine learning approach" by Ruikang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. If the authors describe their methodology for evaluating their approach, they may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "UAV Trajectory Dataset" or "NOMA Simulation Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will ensure to cite the original source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
