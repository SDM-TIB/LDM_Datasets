To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid-Prediction Integrated Planning for Autonomous Driving" by Haochen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed HPP system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the testing benchmarks. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **nuScenes dataset**: Described as one of the largest and most widely used for full-stack autonomous driving, containing over 1,000 20-second frames of driving scenarios annotated at 2 Hz.

2. **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**: This dataset is noted for long-term motion evaluations, comprising 104,000 20-second frames representing unique scenarios, marked at 10 Hz.

3. **CARLA simulator**: Specifically, the Longest6 benchmark is utilized for long-term driving evaluations, with various driving conditions across multiple routes.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are:

- For the **nuScenes dataset**:

- For the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**:
  > S. Ettinger, S. Cheng, B. Caine, C. Liu, H. Zhao, S. Pradhan, Y. Chai, B. Sapp, C. R. Qi, Y. Zhou et al. *Large scale interactive motion forecasting for autonomous driving: The waymo open motion dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021, pp. 9710–9719.

- For the **CARLA simulator**:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning. PMLR, 2017, pp. 1–16.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
