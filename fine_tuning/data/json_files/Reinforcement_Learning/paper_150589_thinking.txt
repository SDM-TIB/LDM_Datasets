To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breeding Machine Translations: Evolutionary approach to survive and thrive in the world of automated evaluation" by Josef Jon and OndË‡rej Bojar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of datasets of adversarial examples, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention using the **CzEng 2.0 dataset** for training their Czech-English machine translation model. This dataset is described as a mix of parallel data and Czech monolingual data, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CzEng 2.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kocmi, T., Popel, M., & Bojar, O. (2020). Announcing CzEng 2.0 parallel corpus with over 2 gigawords. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.03006.

Next, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss the use of various metrics for evaluation, but they do not explicitly mention additional datasets beyond CzEng 2.0.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Locate full citations in the references section for any datasets mentioned.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CzEng 2.0 dataset based on the information collected.
