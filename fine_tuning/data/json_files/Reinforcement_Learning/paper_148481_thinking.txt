To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning-Based Joint Self-Optimisation Method for the Fuzzy Logic Handover Algorithm in 5G HetNets" by Qianyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** for specific details about the datasets. This section often contains information about the data collection process, the types of data used, and any datasets that were specifically referenced. I will look for phrases like "the dataset used" or "the data was collected from."

In the **results section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets that were analyzed or compared. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the experiments and any performance metrics that were derived from them.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "the RSRP dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
