To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rogue-Gym: A New Challenge for Generalization in Reinforcement Learning" by Yuji Kanagawa and Tomoyuki Kaneko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the Rogue-Gym environment but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Rogue-Gym Environment)**, where the authors describe the Rogue-Gym environment in detail. This section outlines the features and characteristics of the environment but does not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, it focuses on the procedural generation of dungeons within the Rogue-Gym itself.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of training or evaluating the reinforcement learning agents. However, the experiments primarily discuss the performance of the PPO algorithm within the Rogue-Gym environment, without referencing any external datasets.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather describes the Rogue-Gym as a self-contained environment for testing generalization in reinforcement learning, I will note that the primary dataset here is the procedural content generated by the Rogue-Gym itself.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to ensure that there are no overlooked datasets that might have been referenced indirectly. The references primarily cite previous works related to reinforcement learning and do not mention any datasets that are used in the experiments.

In conclusion, the only "dataset" mentioned in this paper is the Rogue-Gym environment itself, which is a procedurally generated environment designed for evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning. Therefore, I will document this as follows:

- **Rogue-Gym Environment**: This is a novel environment created for the purpose of evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning. It is not an external dataset but rather a dynamic environment generated through procedural content generation.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations for datasets. Instead, I will summarize the Rogue-Gym environment as the primary focus of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
