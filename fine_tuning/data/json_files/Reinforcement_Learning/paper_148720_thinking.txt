To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Guidance Rewards with Trajectory-space Smoothing" by Tanmay Gangwani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of long-term credit assignment in reinforcement learning and mentions the use of guidance rewards, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to specific datasets or environments that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, the authors mention benchmarking their approach on **MuJoCo locomotion tasks** provided in **OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that they are using a specific environment for their experiments, but I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets associated with these tasks.

In Section 4.2, they discuss a **Rover Domain** for multi-agent environments, which is another specific setting used for evaluation. I will note this as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The references to the environments are as follows:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: 
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **Rover Domain**: 
   > Aida Rahmattalabi, Jen Jen Chung, Mitchell Colby, and Kagan Tumer. *D++: Structural credit assignment in tightly coupled multiagent domains*. In 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 4424–4429. IEEE, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets beyond these environments, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format:

- **MuJoCo locomotion tasks** (from OpenAI Gym):
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- **Rover Domain**:
  > Aida Rahmattalabi, Jen Jen Chung, Mitchell Colby, and Kagan Tumer. *D++: Structural credit assignment in tightly coupled multiagent domains*. In 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 4424–4429. IEEE, 2016.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset based on the extracted details. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
