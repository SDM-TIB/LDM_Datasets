To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods to Nash Equilibria in General Stochastic Games" by Angeliki Giannou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the datasets are not explicitly mentioned in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves. I will look for the references in the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citations for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I would look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy throughout the extraction process. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant dataset information from the paper effectively.
