To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Drive Using Sparse Imitation Reinforcement Learning" by Yuci Han and Alper Yilmaz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **CARLA simulation environment**, which suggests that the authors may have utilized specific datasets or environments within CARLA for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the parts that describe the experimental setup and the environment. In this case, the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments. I will need to check if they refer to any specific datasets or configurations within CARLA that are relevant to their research.

I will also look into the **experiments** section to see if the authors provide details about the data used for training and testing their models. If they mention any specific datasets or configurations, I will note them down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to the CARLA simulator, I will look for the original paper that describes CARLA to provide a proper citation.

Here’s how I will summarize the datasets:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: This is the primary environment used for the experiments. The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017, pp. 1–16.

2. **Sparse Expert Driving Policy**: The authors mention using a sparse expert driving policy generated from the CARLA Autopilot API. While this may not be a traditional dataset, it is a crucial component of their methodology. The citation for the Autopilot API is typically included in the CARLA simulator paper.

3. **Training and Testing Routes**: The paper discusses various routes used for training and testing the SIRL agent. If these routes are based on specific datasets or configurations within CARLA, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
