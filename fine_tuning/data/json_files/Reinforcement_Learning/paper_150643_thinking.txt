To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Multi-Robot Formation Control Using Reinforcement Learning" by Juraj ObradoviÄ‡ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction will give context and may reference specific datasets or experiments that utilize them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and the robots used, specifically the **Sphero SPRK+ educational robots**. However, I need to confirm if any datasets were explicitly mentioned for training or testing purposes.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for validation or comparison of their methods. If they mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, while the authors primarily focus on the Sphero robots and their control algorithms, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets used for training or evaluation. Instead, they describe the simulation environment (Gazebo) and the real-world experiments conducted with the Sphero robots. Therefore, I will note that the primary focus is on the experimental setup rather than on specific datasets.

Since no external datasets are cited, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Sphero SPRK+ Robots**: The paper discusses the use of Sphero SPRK+ robots for real-world experiments, but does not provide a dataset citation as it focuses on the experimental results rather than a dataset.

2. **Gazebo Simulator**: The authors utilize the Gazebo simulator for training and testing, but again, this does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses the use of Sphero robots and the Gazebo simulator, it does not reference any specific datasets with full citations. This will be important for anyone reviewing the paper to understand the context of the experiments conducted.
