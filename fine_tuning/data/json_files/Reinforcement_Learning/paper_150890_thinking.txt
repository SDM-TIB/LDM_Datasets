To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DialCoT Meets PPO: Decomposing and Exploring Reasoning Paths in Smaller Language Models" by Chengcheng Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "four arithmetic reasoning datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **GSM8K**: This dataset contains 7,000 training instances with intermediate questions and answers.
2. **Multi-Arith**: This dataset is referenced as containing arithmetic reasoning problems.
3. **ASDiv**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluating the model's performance.
4. **SVAMP**: This dataset is also included in their evaluation.

I will ensure to gather detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **GSM8K**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. CoRR, abs/2110.14168, 2021.

- For **Multi-Arith**, the citation is:
  > Subhro Roy and Dan Roth. *Solving general arithmetic word problems*. In EMNLP, pages 1743–1752, 2015.

- For **ASDiv**, the citation is:
  > Shen-Yun Miao, Chao-Chun Liang, and Keh-Yih Su. *A diverse corpus for evaluating and developing English math word problem solvers*. In ACL, pages 975–984, 2020.

- For **SVAMP**, the citation is:
  > Arkil Patel, Satwik Bhattamishra, and Navin Goyal. *Are NLP models really able to solve simple math word problems?* In NAACL, pages 2080–2094, 2021.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
