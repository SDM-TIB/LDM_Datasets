To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAQL: Continuous Action Q-Learning" by Moonkyung Ryu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

I will then examine the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets or any mention of datasets in the context of experimental setup.

In this paper, the authors mention using several benchmark environments for their experiments, specifically in the **experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks** section. I will identify the datasets used in these environments, which include:

1. **MuJoCo**: The paper discusses various continuous control tasks evaluated using the MuJoCo physics engine. While MuJoCo itself is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it provides a set of environments that can be considered as benchmarks for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

2. **Pendulum**: A classic control task used for evaluating continuous action algorithms.

3. **Hopper**: Another continuous control task that is part of the MuJoCo suite.

4. **Walker2D**: A 2D walking task used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.

5. **HalfCheetah**: A task where the agent must control a half-cheetah robot.

6. **Ant**: A task involving a quadrupedal robot.

7. **Humanoid**: A more complex task involving a humanoid robot.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmark environments mentioned. However, since MuJoCo is a widely recognized physics engine and not a traditional dataset, I will note that it is commonly referenced in the reinforcement learning community.

The full citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will document the following datasets and their citations:
- **MuJoCo**: A physics engine used for various continuous control tasks.
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for any required output format or further processing.
