To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Two-Stage Bayesian Optimisation for Automatic Tuning of an Unscented Kalman Filter for Vehicle Sideslip Angle Estimation" by Alberto Bertipaglia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions results on an experimental dataset, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Application: UKF Tuning)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for tuning the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Here, they provide details about the dataset, including the number of maneuvers and the context in which the data was collected.

In this section, the authors specify that the dataset consists of **216 maneuvers recorded at the Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH**, which includes various vehicle dynamics maneuvers such as double lane change, slalom, and braking in a turn. They also mention that the data was collected using a BMW test platform equipped with various sensors.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is described as an experimental dataset without a specific citation to a published dataset paper. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from real-world experiments conducted by the authors.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Experimental Dataset**: This dataset consists of 216 maneuvers recorded over 2 hours of driving, covering a wide range of vehicle behaviors. The maneuvers include standard vehicle dynamics tests and were recorded using a BMW test platform with various sensors.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset in the references, I will note that the dataset is based on the authors' experimental work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the necessary details about the dataset and its context as described in the paper.
