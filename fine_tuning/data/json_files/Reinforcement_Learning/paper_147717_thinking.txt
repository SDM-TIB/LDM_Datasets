To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte Carlo Planning method estimates planning horizons during interactive social exchange" by Andreas Hula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the study and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm in a social exchange context, which suggests that there may be datasets related to social interactions or trust tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the complexities of social interactions and references previous studies, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in those studies.

I will then examine the **materials and methods section** closely, as this section typically details the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe the multi-round trust task and mention that they used data from 195 dyads playing the trust game over 10 exchanges. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the trust game.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced or analyzed. The authors may discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to specific datasets, which could provide further context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset from the Trust Game**: This dataset includes interactions from 195 dyads, with details on the exchanges made during the trust game. The authors may reference a specific study or dataset that provides this data.

2. **Citations**: I will ensure to include full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly if they are derived from previous studies or established datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
