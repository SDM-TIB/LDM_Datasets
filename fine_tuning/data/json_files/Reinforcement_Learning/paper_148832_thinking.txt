To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POPO: Pessimistic Offline Policy Optimization" by Qiang He and Xinwen Hou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of diverse, pre-collected datasets for offline reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using datasets from the **d4rl** benchmark, specifically referring to different qualities of datasets such as "expert" and "medium-expert." This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. The authors state that they utilize various quality original transitions from the d4rl datasets to train their model. They specifically mention:

1. **HalfCheetah Expert Dataset**: This dataset is generated by a fine-tuned RL policy.
2. **HalfCheetah Medium-Expert Dataset**: This dataset is produced by mixing equal amounts of expert demonstrations and suboptimal data.
3. **HalfCheetah Medium Dataset**: This dataset consists of data generated by a suboptimal policy.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the d4rl datasets is:

- For **d4rl datasets**, the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, making sure to highlight the importance of the full citations for each dataset.
