To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning with Language Model for Edit-based Unsupervised Summarization" by Ryosuke Kohita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using a specific dataset, which indicates that there may be datasets referenced throughout the paper. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that may include datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they trained their model on the **Gigaword corpus** and used the **DUC datasets** for evaluation. I will note down these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Gigaword corpus**, the citation is:
> Rush, A. M., Cheng, J., & P. A. (2015). *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379–389.

For the **DUC datasets**, the citation is:
> Over, P., Dang, H., & Harman, D. (2007). *DUC in context*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6), 1506–1520.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
