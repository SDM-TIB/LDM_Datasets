To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training for Robots: Offline RL Enables Learning New Tasks in a Handful of Trials" by Aviral Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "existing diverse offline datasets" and specifically references the **Bridge Dataset** as a source for pre-training. This indicates that there are datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention the **Bridge Dataset** again, describing it as an extensive dataset consisting of thousands of trials for various robotic manipulation tasks in multiple environments. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors discuss the use of a **target dataset** for fine-tuning, which consists of a small number of demonstrations for specific tasks. However, they do not provide a specific name for this target dataset, as it varies depending on the task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Bridge Dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ebert, F., Yang, Y., Schmeckpeper, K., Bucher, B., Georgakis, G., Daniilidis, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2021). Bridge data: Boosting generalization of robotic skills with cross-domain datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.13396.

Since the target dataset does not have a specific name or citation, I will note that it consists of demonstrations collected for various tasks but will not include a citation for it.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Bridge Dataset** while noting the absence of a citation for the target dataset.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Bridge Dataset**: Used for pre-training, consisting of thousands of trials for various robotic manipulation tasks.
   - Citation: Ebert, F., Yang, Y., Schmeckpeper, K., Bucher, B., Georgakis, G., Daniilidis, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2021). Bridge data: Boosting generalization of robotic skills with cross-domain datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.13396.

2. **Target Dataset**: A collection of demonstrations for specific tasks, but no specific citation is provided.

With this information, I will prepare the final output for review or further processing.
