To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-RL) for Autonomous Decision-Making in Dynamic Environment" by Jayabrata Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on the **SMARTS urban benchmarking scenarios**, which indicates that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe various driving scenarios used for evaluation, such as **Left Turn-T**, **Roundabout**, and **Double Merge**. However, I need to determine if these scenarios are based on existing datasets or if they are custom scenarios created for the study.

Upon further examination, I find that the paper references the **SMARTS simulator** as the environment used for training and testing the DAD-RL framework. This suggests that the scenarios are part of the SMARTS framework rather than standalone datasets. Therefore, I will need to look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that SMARTS might utilize.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the experiments. The references include various papers, but I need to identify if any of them specifically relate to datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites the following relevant works:

1. **SMARTS**: 
   > Zhou, Ming, et al. "SMARTS: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School for Autonomous Driving." arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.09776, 2020.

2. **Scene-Rep Transformer (SRT)**:
   > Liu, H., Huang, Z., Mo, X., and Lv, C. "Augmenting Reinforcement Learning with Transformer-based Scene Representation Learning for Decision-making of Autonomous Driving." IEEE Trans. on Intelligent Vehicles, 2024, pp. 1-17.

While SMARTS is not a traditional dataset, it provides a framework for simulating driving scenarios, which can be considered a dataset for the purposes of this research.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations:

- **SMARTS Urban Benchmarking Scenarios**: This framework includes various driving scenarios for evaluating autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. The reference for SMARTS is:
  > Zhou, Ming, et al. "SMARTS: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School for Autonomous Driving." arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.09776, 2020.

- **Scene-Rep Transformer (SRT)**: This is referenced as a baseline for comparison in the experiments. The citation is:
  > Liu, H., Huang, Z., Mo, X., and Lv, C. "Augmenting Reinforcement Learning with Transformer-based Scene Representation Learning for Decision-making of Autonomous Driving." IEEE Trans. on Intelligent Vehicles, 2024, pp. 1-17.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or framework mentioned.
