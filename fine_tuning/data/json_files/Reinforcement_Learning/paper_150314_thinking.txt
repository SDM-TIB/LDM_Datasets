To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Counterfactual Estimation" by Natraj Raman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of counterfactual explanations and mention that they will demonstrate their approach using public tabular datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains income factors of various individuals, including attributes like Gender, Race, Marital Status, Education, Workclass, Occupation, Age, and Hours. The classification objective is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes 20 different attributes of individuals who take credit from a bank, with a binary label indicating if an individual is a credit risk or not.

3. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains information on customers who received a home equity line of credit, with over 20 features that are predominantly continuous and a binary label indicating whether a customer paid back the loan.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 1996.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hans Hofmann. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 1994.

- For the **HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > FICO. *FICO XML Challenge*, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
