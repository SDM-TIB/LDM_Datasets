To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Ensemble Q-learning: Minimizing Estimation Bias via Error Feedback" by Hang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks they are used for.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **MuJoCo benchmark**. I will check if they provide specific datasets or environments within this benchmark that they used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MuJoCo physics engine**, I will look for the citation that describes this engine, which is often referenced in reinforcement learning literature.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clearly documented and formatted correctly for easy reference in future work or analysis.
