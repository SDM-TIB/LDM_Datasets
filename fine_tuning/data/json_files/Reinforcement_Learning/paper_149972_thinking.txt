To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A maintenance planning framework using online and offline deep reinforcement learning" by Zaharah A. Bukhsh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper develops a deep reinforcement learning solution for rehabilitation planning of water pipes, which suggests that there may be datasets related to water distribution systems.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide details about the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention using data from **16 pipes** in a water distribution system, which is summarized in **Table 1**. This table includes attributes such as age, material, length, failure rate, and failure probability for each pipe.

I will extract the relevant dataset information from **Table 1**. The dataset consists of:

1. **Water Pipes Dataset**: This dataset includes the characteristics of 16 different pipes, detailing their age, material, length, failure rate, and failure probability.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own experiments and not from an external source, it may not have a formal citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on the authors' simulation and data collection during their study.

The relevant citation for the paper itself is:
> Bukhsh, Z. A., Molegraaf, H., & Jansen, N. (2023). A maintenance planning framework using online and offline deep reinforcement learning. *Neural Computing and Applications*, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-08560-7.

Since the dataset is not formally published elsewhere, I will document it as follows:

- **Water Pipes Dataset**: Data collected from 16 pipes in a water distribution system, including attributes such as age, material, length, failure rate, and failure probability.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
