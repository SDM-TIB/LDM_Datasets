To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Reinforcement Learning Tricks for Video Games" by Anssi Kanervisto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the use of "three complex RL environments," which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of the environments that serve as datasets for the reinforcement learning tasks.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors mention three environments:
1. **ViZDoom Deathmatch**: This environment is used for training RL agents in a first-person shooter scenario. The authors describe the challenges and the specific setup for the experiments conducted in this environment.
2. **MineRL ObtainDiamond**: This environment is built in Minecraft, where the goal is to obtain a diamond. The authors detail the challenges faced by agents in this environment and the specific tricks applied.
3. **Google Research Football (GFootball)**: This is a 3D RL environment simulating an 11 vs 11 football game. The authors describe the setup and the challenges faced by agents in this environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments, as they are treated as datasets in the context of this research.

- For **ViZDoom**, the citation is:

- For **MineRL**, the citation is:
  > W. H. Guss, C. Codel, K. Hofmann, B. Houghton, N. Kuno, S. Milani, et al. *The MineRL competition on sample efficient reinforcement learning using human priors*. arXiv:1904.10079, 2019.

- For **Google Research Football**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
