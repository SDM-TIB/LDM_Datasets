To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Continual Learning with Maximally Interfered Retrieval" by Rahaf Aljundi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss continual learning and mention that they will evaluate their method on several standard datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **MNIST Split**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset, creating five different tasks with non-overlapping classes, with 1000 samples per task.

2. **Permuted MNIST**: This dataset is also based on MNIST, where the images are permuted to create ten different tasks, again with 1000 samples per task.

3. **CIFAR-10 Split**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is split into five disjoint tasks, with 9,750 samples per task and 250 samples retained for validation.

4. **MiniImagenet Split**: This dataset is derived from the MiniImagenet dataset, split into 20 disjoint tasks with five classes each.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors may not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can look for the original papers or sources from which these datasets are derived:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For **MiniImagenet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, et al. *Matching Networks for One-Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
