To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online and Offline Reinforcement Learning by Planning with a Learned Model" by Julian Schrittwieser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **RL Unplugged offline RL benchmark**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **RL Unplugged benchmark dataset** for offline RL experiments. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with their work.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The authors describe their experiments on two main datasets:
1. **Atari**: This dataset consists of 46 games, each with 200 million frames, and is used for evaluating their algorithm in a discrete action space with pixel observations.
2. **DM Control Suite**: This dataset includes 9 different tasks with varying numbers of frames and continuous action spaces.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to retrieve are:
- For the **RL Unplugged benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caglar Gulcehre, Ziyu Wang, Andrey Novikov, et al. *RL Unplugged: Benchmarks for Offline Reinforcement Learning*. 2020. URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13888.

- For the **Atari dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

- For the **DM Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., Lillicrap, T., and Riedmiller, M. *DeepMind Control Suite*. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
