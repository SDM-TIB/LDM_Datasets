To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing Cooperative Policies for Multi-Stage Tasks" by Jordan Erskine and Chris Lehnert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental sections**. In this paper, the authors describe a maze domain used for testing their Cooperative Soft Actor Critic (CSAC) algorithm. I will look for any specific datasets or environments that are defined or referenced in these sections.

In the **experimental studies section**, the authors describe the maze domain in detail, including how it is structured and the tasks involved. They mention that the maze consists of a series of rooms, each representing a subtask. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets; instead, they describe the environment they created for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a custom environment, I will note that the dataset in this case is the maze domain itself, which is a synthetic environment created for the purpose of the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or environments are cited that could be relevant to the work. However, the references primarily discuss reinforcement learning techniques and do not point to specific datasets.

Given that the maze domain is a custom environment and not a publicly available dataset, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Maze Domain**: A custom environment designed for the experiments, consisting of multiple rooms where agents must navigate through tasks. The maze is structured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSAC algorithm in a multi-stage task setting.

Since there are no formal citations for datasets in this paper, I will note that the maze domain is an original contribution of the authors and does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight that the maze domain is a custom experimental setup rather than a dataset with a formal citation.
