To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Deep Attention Recurrent Neural Network for Heterogeneous Time Series Imputation" by Linglong Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using "real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five datasets:

1. **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data**: This dataset provides hourly data on air pollutants from 12 locations, consisting of 17,532 samples with 18 variables.

2. **eICU Collaborative Research Database**: A public multi-center database containing anonymized health data related to over 200,000 US ICU hospitalizations, with 30,680 samples and 20 variables.

3. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A comprehensive database of over 40,000 critical care patients, with two different datasets extracted for experiments: one with 14,188 samples for 89 variables and another with 21,128 valid samples for 59 variables.

4. **PhysioNet Challenge 2012 Dataset**: This dataset includes records of 4,000 48-hour ICU stays, with 3,997 samples and 35 variables.

5. **Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set**: Public hourly traffic volume data for Interstate 94 Westbound, consisting of 1,860 samples with 58 variables.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data**:
  > Shuyi Zhang et al. "Cautionary tales on air-quality improvement in Beijing." *Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences*, 473(2205):20170457, 2017.

- For **eICU Collaborative Research Database**:
  > Tom J. Pollard et al. "The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research." *Scientific Data*, 5(1):1–13, 2018.

  > Alistair Johnson et al. "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database." *Scientific Data*, 3(1):1–9, 2016.

- For **Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set**:
  > Arthur Asuncion and David Newman. "UCI Machine Learning Repository." 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
