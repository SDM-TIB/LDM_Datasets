To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actionable Recourse via GANs for Mobile Health" by Jennifer Chien et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **Safe Delivery App**, which suggests that there may be associated datasets related to its usage.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Methods**, **Results**, or any dedicated **Datasets** section. In this paper, the **Appendix D** provides detailed information about the data used, specifically mentioning that the data pertains to users of the Safe Delivery App from January 1, 2018, to October 1, 2021, across various countries.

In **Appendix D**, the authors describe the dataset as containing logs from users of the Safe Delivery App, which includes metrics such as daily sessions, time spent using the app, and other user activity data. This is crucial information that indicates the dataset's focus on user engagement and behavior.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Safe Delivery App dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Safe Delivery App**:
  > Maternity Foundation. *Safe Delivery App*. Available at: https://www.maternity.dk/safe-delivery-app/, 2022.

Since the dataset is derived from the logs of the Safe Delivery App, this citation is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets extracted from the paper.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:

1. **Safe Delivery App Dataset**: Contains user logs from the Safe Delivery App, including metrics on user engagement and behavior from January 1, 2018, to October 1, 2021.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
