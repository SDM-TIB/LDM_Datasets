To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sales Time Series Analytics Using Deep Q-Learning" by Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on sales time series analytics using deep Q-learning, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses various time series models and machine learning approaches but does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology and case study sections**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for the experiments. In the section discussing the supply-demand case study, the author states that they used historical sales data from the **'Rossmann Store Sales' Kaggle competition**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the 'Rossmann Store Sales' dataset. The citation is as follows:
> "Rossmann Store Sales", Kaggle.com. Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales. Accessed December 5, 2019.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the 'Rossmann Store Sales' dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
