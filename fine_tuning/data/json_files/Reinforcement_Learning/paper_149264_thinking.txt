To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Packetized Energy Management Controller for Residential Consumers" by HaÔ¨Åz Majid Hussain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for simulations or experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and previous works, which might reference datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets"** or **"Data Collection"** section. If such a section is not explicitly present, I will check the **methodology** and **results** sections for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of various optimization algorithms and their performance metrics, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or testing. Instead, they refer to simulation parameters and results derived from these simulations. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and results, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will summarize the key points regarding the simulation data used in the experiments, such as the parameters for the photovoltaic system and battery storage, which are critical for understanding the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured summary, noting the absence of specific datasets while highlighting the simulation parameters that were utilized in the research.
