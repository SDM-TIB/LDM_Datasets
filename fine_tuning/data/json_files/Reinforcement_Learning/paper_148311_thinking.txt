To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Periodic Q-Learning" by Donghwan Lee and Niao He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments in these sections. If there is a section titled "Datasets" or something similar, I will focus on that to find detailed descriptions of the datasets.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology** or **experiments** sections for any mentions of datasets. Authors often describe the datasets they used to validate their methods in these parts of the paper.

Once I identify the datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific characteristics that are mentioned.

After gathering the dataset information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the citation in the references that provides the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity and traceability of the information.
