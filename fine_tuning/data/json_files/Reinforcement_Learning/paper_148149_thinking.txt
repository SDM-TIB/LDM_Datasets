To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Behavior Cloning and Reinforcement Learning for Improved Performance in Dense and Sparse Reward Environments" by Gregory M. Gremillion et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific environments:

1. **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**: This is a standard environment provided by the OpenAI Gym library, which is commonly used for reinforcement learning tasks. The authors describe both dense and sparse reward cases for this environment.

2. **Custom Quadrotor Landing Task**: This task is implemented using Microsoft AirSim and involves landing a quadrotor in a simulated environment with gusty conditions. The authors provide details about the state and action spaces for this task.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. The citations for the environments mentioned are:

- For **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **Microsoft AirSim**, the citation is:
  > Shital Shah, Debadeepta Dey, Chris Lovett, and Ashish Kapoor. *AirSim: High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles*. In Field and Service Robotics. arXiv:arXiv:1705.05065, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
