To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in StarCraft II with Human Expertise in Subgoals Selection" by Xinyi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. In this case, the authors mention experimental results in two StarCraft II minigames, which suggests that datasets related to these minigames may be present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using two specific minigames: **Build Marines (BM)** and **Collect Minerals and Gas (CMAG)**. These minigames are likely the datasets used for their experiments, as they are customized environments within the StarCraft II framework.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about these minigames. The authors explicitly state that they implemented customized SC2 minigames (subtasks) for their experiments, which reinforces that these minigames serve as the datasets for their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets. Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the minigames, I will reference the original source of the StarCraft II environment and the relevant literature that discusses the use of these minigames in reinforcement learning research. The appropriate citations are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
