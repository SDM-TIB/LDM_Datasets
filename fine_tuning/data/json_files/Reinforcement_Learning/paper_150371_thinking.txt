To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining text classifiers through progressive neighborhood approximation with realistic samples" by Yi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted exhaustive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention evaluating their approaches on two real-world datasets: **Yelp reviews** and **Amazon reviews polarity**. I will note down these names as they are crucial for the dataset entries.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of instances, types of labels, and any specific features mentioned. The paper states that the **Yelp dataset** consists of restaurant reviews with a maximum text length of 16, and the **Amazon dataset** contains customer reviews about various products, redefined for binary classification.

After gathering the necessary information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset entries.

For the **Yelp dataset**, the citation is:
> Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems, pages 165–172, 2013.

For the **Amazon reviews polarity dataset**, the citation is:
> Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems-Volume 1, pages 649–657, 2015.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into structured entries that reflect the datasets used in the research paper. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset, including their full citations.
