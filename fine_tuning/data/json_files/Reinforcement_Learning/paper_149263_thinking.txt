To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Settling the Variance of Multi-Agent Policy Gradients" by Jakub Grudzien Kuba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in detail. This section is crucial as it usually contains explicit mentions of dataset names, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like **Multi-Agent MuJoCo** and **StarCraft challenges**, as these are likely to be the datasets used for evaluation based on the context provided in the abstract and introduction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the **Multi-Agent MuJoCo** dataset is used, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is cited as follows:
> Yan Duan, Xi Chen, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman, and Pieter Abbeel. *Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for continuous control*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 1329â€“1338. PMLR, 2016.

I will record this citation along with any other datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper along with their proper citations.
