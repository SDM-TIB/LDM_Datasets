To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prioritized Offline Goal-Swapping Experience Replay" by Wenyan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the dataset consists of."

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** in detail, particularly looking for any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on six goal-conditioned tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets. I will look for any details about these datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that the ofï¬‚ine dataset for each task is a mixture of 500 expert trajectories and 2,000 random trajectories. They also reference that the datasets for the fetching tasks are taken from Yang et al. (2022) and that the expert trajectories for the in-hand manipulation tasks are generated similarly to Liu et al. (2022a). This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned. I will look for the papers cited (e.g., Yang et al. (2022) and Liu et al. (2022a)) to ensure I have the correct citations for the datasets used in the experiments.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the datasets used in the fetching tasks, which are referenced as coming from:
   > Rui Yang, Yiming Lu, Wenzhe Li, Hao Sun, Meng Fang, Yali Du, Xiu Li, Lei Han, and Chongjie Zhang. *Rethinking goal-conditioned supervised learning and its connection to offline RL*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.04478, 2022.

2. For the expert trajectories for the in-hand manipulation tasks, which are generated similarly to:
   > Minghuan Liu, Menghui Zhu, and Weinan Zhang. *Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning: Problems and solutions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.08299, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
