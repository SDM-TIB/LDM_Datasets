To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tactical Decision Making for Emergency Vehicles Based on A Combinational Learning Method" by Haoyi Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of reducing response times for emergency vehicles (EVs) but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction cites a set of data from RapidSOS regarding the impact of response times on mortality and healthcare costs, which indicates that there may be relevant datasets related to emergency response times.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to identify any datasets that might have been used in previous studies referenced by the authors. This section discusses various approaches to emergency vehicle routing and decision-making but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **task modeling and evaluation sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their simulations or experiments. The paper mentions the use of the SUMO traffic emulator for their framework, which suggests that they may have used specific traffic datasets or simulation parameters, but it does not explicitly list any datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. The references include various studies and papers, but I need to determine if any of these are datasets that the authors utilized in their research.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the findings and document any datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for any dataset mentions.
2. Review the related work section for referenced datasets.
3. Check the task modeling and evaluation sections for datasets used in simulations.
4. Consult the references section for potential dataset citations.
5. Document findings and ensure full citations are included for any identified datasets.
