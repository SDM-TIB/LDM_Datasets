To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Off-policy Baselines for Memory-based Continuous Control" by Zhihan Yang and Hai Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating algorithms on various tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) and the **domains section** (Section 5) closely. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In Section 5, the authors describe several tasks, including:
1. **Sensor integration tasks**: They mention three specific tasks: pendulum, cartpole, and reacher, but do not explicitly name datasets. I will need to check if these tasks are associated with any publicly available datasets.
2. **Memory tasks**: The tasks mentioned are reacher-pomdp and watermaze. I will look for any references to datasets associated with these tasks.
3. **Active exploration task**: The push-r-bump task is described, and I will check if it is linked to a specific dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the reacher-pomdp task is based on a specific dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset and extract the citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy throughout the extraction process.
