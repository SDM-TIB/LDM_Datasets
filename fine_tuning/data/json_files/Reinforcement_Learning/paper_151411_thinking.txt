To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flow AM: Generating Point Cloud Global Explanations by Latent Alignment" by Hanxiao Tan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **ModelNet40** as the primary dataset for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its composition and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe ModelNet40 as consisting of 40 classes totaling 12,311 CAD models, with training and test sets containing 9,843 and 2,468 object instances, respectively. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for ModelNet40. The citation for ModelNet40 is as follows:
> Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 652â€“660, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In this case, the authors also refer to **ShapeNet** in their experiments. I will gather details about ShapeNet as well.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they also generate global explanations for PointNet trained on the ShapeNet dataset. I will look for the citation for ShapeNet in the references.

The citation for ShapeNet is:
> Angel X. Chang, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
