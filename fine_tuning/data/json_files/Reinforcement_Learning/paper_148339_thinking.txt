To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study on Parameter Estimation in Software Reliability Modeling using Swarm Intelligence" by Najla Akram AL-Saati and Marrwa Abd-AlKareem Alabajee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the algorithms are evaluated using real software failure data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Datasets and Parameter Settings"**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **Data1, Data2, and Data3**. They also refer to a dataset called the **Musa Dataset**, which is taken from the Data Analysis Center for Software’s Reliability Dataset. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites a previous work by A. Sheta (2006) regarding the datasets used, which is crucial for providing the correct citation for Data1, Data2, and Data3. The Musa Dataset is referenced with a URL, which I will also include.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Data1, Data2, and Data3**, the citation is:
  > A. Sheta, "Reliability Growth Modeling for Software Fault Detection Using Particle Swarm Optimization", IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, Vancouver, Canada, 2006, pp: 3071-3078.

- For the **Musa Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Data Analysis Center for Software’s Reliability Dataset. Available at: https://sw.thecsiac.com/databases/sled/swrel.php.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
