To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection" by Yue Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose two datasets: **AM3D-Sim** and **AM3D-Real**. This is a good starting point, as it suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in 3D object detection for drones and mentions the need for well-organized datasets, confirming the importance of AM3D-Sim and AM3D-Real.

I will then look at **section IV (Dataset Preparation)**, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors describe:

1. **AM3D-Sim**: This dataset is generated through the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, containing 48,250 images with 2D and 3D bounding box annotations. The flying height ranges from 40 to 80 meters.

2. **AM3D-Real**: This dataset is collected using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone, containing 397,984 images with similar annotations. The flying height for this dataset is lower, ranging from 30 to 40 meters.

Both datasets are designed to facilitate aerial monocular 3D object detection, and the authors emphasize the quality of the annotations provided.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AM3D-Sim**, the citation is:
  > Hu, Y., Fang, S., Xie, W., & Chen, S. (2023). *Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **AM3D-Real**, the citation is the same as above since both datasets are part of the same paper.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
1. **AM3D-Sim**: A simulation dataset generated by co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA.
2. **AM3D-Real**: A real-world dataset collected using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets in any subsequent documentation or output.
