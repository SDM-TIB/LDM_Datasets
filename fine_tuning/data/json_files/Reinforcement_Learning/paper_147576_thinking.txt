To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Analysis of Proximal Policy Optimization with Kronecker-factored Natural Gradients" by Jiaming Song and Yuhuai Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on various **MuJoCo environments**. I will look for specific names of these environments as they often serve as datasets in reinforcement learning contexts.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several specific environments:

1. **HalfCheetah-v1**: A standard benchmark in reinforcement learning for evaluating algorithms.
2. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v1**: Another common environment used for testing control algorithms.
3. **Reacher-v1**: A task that involves reaching a target position.
4. **Hopper-v1**: A benchmark for evaluating bipedal locomotion.

These environments are widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community and serve as datasets for training and evaluating algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. However, since these environments are part of the MuJoCo physics engine, they do not have individual citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will cite the MuJoCo paper itself, which describes the environments:

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for MuJoCo as the source of the environments used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
