To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fixing Errors of the Google Voice Recognizer through Phonetic Distance Metrics" by Diego Campos Sobrino et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an algorithm for correcting speech recognition errors, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction hints at the use of specific phrases from a domain, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental work)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using **451 audio files recorded by nine different users** in the context of picking up orders from a pizzeria. This indicates that there is a dataset of audio files used for testing the algorithm.

The authors also mention that the audio files were recorded in **FLAC format** and that the phrases uttered by users were stored in a database. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note that the dataset consists of audio files related to a pizzeria's menu, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

In addition, the authors refer to a **set of 34 phrases typical of the pizzeria domain** that were used as context for the speech recognition API. This set of phrases is also part of the experimental setup, but again, it lacks a formal dataset name.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, it appears that the authors do not cite any specific datasets or provide full citations for the audio files or the phrases used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide formal names or citations for the datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Pizzeria Audio Dataset**: A collection of 451 audio files recorded by nine users, used to test the speech recognition algorithm in the context of a pizzeria's menu. The dataset is not formally named or cited in the paper.

2. **Pizzeria Context Phrases**: A set of 34 phrases typical of the pizzeria domain, used to improve recognition accuracy in the speech recognition API. This set is also not formally named or cited.

In conclusion, while I have identified the datasets used in the experiments, the paper does not provide specific names or citations for them. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are described but lack formal citations, which is important for proper referencing in research.
