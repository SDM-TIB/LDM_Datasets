To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-based Surprise Minimization for Multi-Agent Value Factorization" by Karush Suri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **StarCraft II micromanagement scenarios**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset or benchmark related to these scenarios.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context about the experiments. For instance, Table 1 presents a comparison of success rates across different scenarios, which suggests that these scenarios are part of a dataset used for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors refer to the **StarCraft II micromanagement scenarios**, which are part of the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge**. The relevant citation for this dataset is:

- For **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge**:
  > Samvelyan, M., Rashid, T., de Witt, C. S., Farquhar, G., Nardelli, N., Rudner, T. G. J., Hung, C.-M., Torr, P. H. S., Foerster, J., & Whiteson, S. (2019). *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset mentions.
3. Check figures and tables for additional context.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
5. Document the datasets with their citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
