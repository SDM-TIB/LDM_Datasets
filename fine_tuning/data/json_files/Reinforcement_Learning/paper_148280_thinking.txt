To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Sample Analysis of Stochastic Approximation Using Smooth Convex Envelopes" by Zaiwei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to reinforcement learning or stochastic approximation, as these are the main topics of the research. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I will look for the citation that corresponds to this dataset. If the dataset is not widely known, I will ensure to capture any specific details provided by the authors to facilitate future access.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
