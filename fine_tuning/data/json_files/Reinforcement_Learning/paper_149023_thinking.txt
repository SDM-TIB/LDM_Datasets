To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Deterministic Path Following" by Georg Hess and William Ljungbergh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a custom kinematic bicycle environment for training and evaluation, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or at least a significant part of the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe the environment in detail. They mention that the environment was produced by the authors and consists of a kinematic bicycle model. This indicates that the dataset is not a traditional dataset with labeled data but rather a simulation environment created for the purpose of their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any quantitative metrics or evaluations based on the dataset/environment they created. They discuss performance metrics such as average cross-track error and velocity error, which are derived from the simulations conducted in their custom environment.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a custom simulation environment, I will note this as the primary dataset used in their experiments. 

Now, I will look at the **references section** to ensure that I capture any relevant citations that may pertain to the methods or algorithms used in conjunction with their custom environment. The references include several foundational papers on reinforcement learning and control algorithms, but they do not provide a traditional dataset citation.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the **custom kinematic bicycle environment** created by the authors. Since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that in the dataset description.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to credit the authors for their work.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Georg Hess and William Ljungbergh. *Deep Deterministic Path Following*. Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this analysis.
