To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AM-LFS: AutoML for Loss Function Search" by Chuming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method was evaluated on "four benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for different tasks:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test set has 10,000 images.

2. **MegaFace**: This dataset is used for face recognition and is noted as the largest public testing benchmark for evaluating face recognition algorithms at a million scale of distractors. It is paired with the CASIA-Webface dataset for training.

3. **Market-1501**: This dataset includes images of 1,501 persons captured from six different cameras, with a training set of 12,936 images and a testing set of 3,368 query images and 19,732 gallery images.

4. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset is a subset of Duke-MTMC for person re-identification, containing 36,411 annotated bounding box images of 1,812 different identities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, CiteSeer, 2009.

- For **MegaFace**, the citation is:
  > Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Steven M. Seitz, Daniel Miller, and Evan Brossard. *The megaface benchmark: 1 million faces for recognition at scale*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4873–4882, 2016.

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ergys Ristani, Francesco Solera, Roger S. Zou, Rita Cucchiara, and Carlo Tomasi. *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 17–35, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
