To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Triggered Decentralized Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Edge Devices" by Shahryar Zehtabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "two real-world machine learning task datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their numerical evaluations. Here, they specifically mention using two datasets:

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset is described as containing data belonging to 10 labels, and it is used for image classification tasks.

2. **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**: This dataset contains data points with 62 different labels and is also used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**, the citation is:
  > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečny, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. (2018). Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01097.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
