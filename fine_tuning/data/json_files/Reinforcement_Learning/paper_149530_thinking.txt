To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Efficiency of Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning by Accounting for Past Decisions" by Brett Daley and Christopher Amato, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section typically outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain explicit mentions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

If the paper refers to a specific dataset like the **Atari 2600 games**, I would ensure to find the original source or paper that introduced this dataset and provide that citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic referencing and allows others to access the datasets used in the research.
