To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dirichlet policies for reinforced factor portfolios" by Eric AndrÃ© and Guillaume Coqueret, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors use a "large dataset of US equities," which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and protocols)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset comprises firms listed in the US between January 2000 and June 2020, downloaded from Bloomberg. They also specify that the dataset includes twelve attributes corresponding to documented predictors, which are summarized in Table 1.

In this section, I will note the following details about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: US Equities Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing firms listed in the US from January 2000 to June 2020, with monthly observations and twelve attributes corresponding to documented predictors.
   - **Source**: Bloomberg LP

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is sourced from Bloomberg, it may not have a formal citation like a typical academic paper. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- For the **US Equities Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bloomberg LP. *Data on US equities from January 2000 to June 2020*. Available upon reasonable request and with permission of Bloomberg LP.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered. 

After completing this process, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
