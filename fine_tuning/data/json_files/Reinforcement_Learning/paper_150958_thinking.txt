To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data-driven Recommendation Framework for Optimal Walker Designs" by Advaith Narayanan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a dataset of over 5,000 parametric walker designs, which is a strong indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look specifically at **section III (Dataset Generation)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. Here, I find that the dataset consists of **5,006 parametric walker designs**, each containing **16 parameters** and **8 performance values**. The performance values include metrics such as mass, structural integrity, and stability, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's applications.

In the **conclusion**, the author reiterates the significance of the dataset, emphasizing its role in optimizing walker designs and its availability as an open-source resource. This confirms the dataset's relevance and accessibility for further research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves and does not refer to an external source, I will create a citation that reflects its origin:

- For the **Walker Design Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Advaith Narayanan. *A Data-driven Recommendation Framework for Optimal Walker Designs*. Unpublished dataset, 2023. Available at: github.com/AdvaithN1/Walker-Optimization.git

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the citation in the final output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
