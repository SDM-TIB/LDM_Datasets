To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrossNorm: On Normalization for Off-Policy TD Reinforcement Learning" by Aditya Bhatt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of cross-normalization to DDPG and TD3 on MuJoCo benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find explicit mentions of datasets used in the evaluations. In this paper, the authors refer to the **MuJoCo benchmark tasks** as the environments where their methods were tested. I will look for specific dataset names or references to the original sources of these benchmarks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four specific MuJoCo tasks: **HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Ant-v2**. These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used platform for reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets associated with these tasks. The relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym, which includes these MuJoCo environments, is:

- For the OpenAI Gym:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR, abs/1606.01540, 2016.

Since the MuJoCo tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the tasks and the corresponding citation for the OpenAI Gym. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets utilized in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. **HalfCheetah-v2**
2. **Hopper-v2**
3. **Walker2d-v2**
4. **Ant-v2**

And I will use the citation for the OpenAI Gym as the reference for these datasets.
