To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlowPG: Action-constrained Policy Gradient with Normalizing Flows" by Janaka Chathuranga Brahmanage et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are used in their experiments.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. This section may provide insights into the characteristics of the datasets, such as their size, type, and any specific features that are relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments on continuous control tasks and resource allocation problems. The authors may refer to standard benchmarks or datasets commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurately documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure that all citations are complete and correctly formatted according to academic standards.
