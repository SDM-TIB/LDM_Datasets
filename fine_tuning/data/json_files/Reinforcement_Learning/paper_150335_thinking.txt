To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The impact of surplus sharing on the outcomes of specific investments under negotiated transfer pricing" by Christian Mitsch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section often outlines the context and may reference prior studies or datasets used in the research. If the paper discusses agent-based simulations, I will check if it mentions any specific datasets used for training or validation.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the simulation setup. This section may detail the parameters and data used for the agent-based simulation, including any datasets that were generated or utilized during the experiments.

I will also examine the **results section** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. The authors may discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and the full citations as they appear in the references. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive list of datasets used in the study.

After gathering all relevant information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process.
