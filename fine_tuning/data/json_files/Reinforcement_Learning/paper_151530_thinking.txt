To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Extreme Q-learning by Maclaurin Expansion" by Motoki Omura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which they are used. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In the provided text, I notice a list of datasets mentioned under the **Experiments** section, specifically in the context of offline reinforcement learning tasks. The datasets listed include:

1. **halfcheetah-med**
2. **hopper-med**
3. **walker2d-med**
4. **halfcheetah-med-rep**
5. **hopper-med-rep**
6. **walker2d-med-rep**
7. **halfcheetah-med-exp**
8. **hopper-med-exp**
9. **walker2d-med-exp**
10. **antmaze-umaze**
11. **antmaze-umaze-div**
12. **antmaze-med-play**
13. **antmaze-med-div**
14. **antmaze-large-play**
15. **antmaze-large-div**
16. **kitchen-complete**
17. **kitchen-partial**
18. **kitchen-mixed**

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are part of the D4RL benchmark, which is a well-known collection of datasets for reinforcement learning. The citation for the D4RL dataset is:

> Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citation, I will compile this information into a structured format. Each dataset will be described with its name and the citation for the D4RL benchmark, as it encompasses all the datasets listed.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
