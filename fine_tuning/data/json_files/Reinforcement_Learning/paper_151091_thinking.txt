To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiagent Copilot Approach for Shared Autonomy between Human EEG and TD3 Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Chun-Ren Phang and Akimasa Hirata, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Electroencephalography Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **EEG dataset presented by Kaya et al.**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 12 healthy participants, detailing the acquisition method, sampling frequency, and the tasks involved. This dataset is crucial for understanding the BCI component of the study.

2. **BCI Competition dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a secondary dataset used for assessment, which includes EEG data from nine healthy participants and describes the recording setup and tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **EEG dataset by Kaya et al.**, the citation is:
  > Kaya, M., et al. (2018). "A large electroencephalographic motor imagery dataset for electroencephalographic brain computer interfaces." *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-16.

- For the **BCI Competition dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tangermann, M., et al. (2012). "Review of the BCI competition IV." *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 6, 55.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations, which is essential for proper attribution and further research.
