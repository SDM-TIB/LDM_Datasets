To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Process Parameter Optimization in Additive Manufacturing" by Susheel Dharmadhikari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a reinforcement learning methodology for process optimization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss various approaches to process parameter optimization in additive manufacturing. They reference prior studies and methodologies but do not specify any datasets at this point.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the subsection titled "Eagar-Tsai Environment," the authors describe the use of the Eagar-Tsai formulation to emulate the laser-directed energy deposition environment. They mention that the formulation is calibrated using experimental melt pool depths measured for single-line, single-track deposits of SS316L powder. This indicates that experimental data is being used, but I need to find the specific dataset or source.

I will then look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize experimental data or datasets. In the **results section**, the authors present various figures and tables that illustrate the performance of the Q-learning algorithm and the results of the optimization. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may contain datasets. The authors reference several studies, but I need to identify which of these references might correspond to the datasets used in their experiments.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors mention the Eagar-Tsai formulation, which is attributed to:
- Eagar, T.W., & Tsai, N.S. (1983). "Temperature fields produced by traveling distributed heat sources." *Welding Journal*, 62(12), 346â€“355.

This reference provides the foundational model used in their experiments but does not constitute a dataset itself. The authors do not provide a specific dataset citation for the experimental data they collected.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of experimental data and references the Eagar-Tsai formulation, it does not explicitly name or cite any datasets. Therefore, I will document the reference to the Eagar-Tsai formulation as the only relevant citation related to the methodology used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
