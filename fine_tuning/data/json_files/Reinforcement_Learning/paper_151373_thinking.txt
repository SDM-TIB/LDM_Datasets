To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Forest Fire Prevention: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Effective Firebreak Placement" by Lucas Murray et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a fire spread simulator called **Cell2Fire**, which suggests that this simulator may be a key component of the datasets used in the research. The introduction may provide additional context or specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly subsection 2.3, which discusses the **Fire Growth Model**. This section explicitly mentions the **Cell2Fire** simulator, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study. I will note down any details about how this simulator operates and whether it is publicly available or if it has specific datasets associated with it.

I will also look for any references to specific datasets or landscapes used in the experiments, particularly in subsection 2.6, where the authors describe the experimental setup. Here, they mention two real landscapes: **Sub20** and **Sub40**, both located in Alberta, Canada. I will gather details about these landscapes, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, I will look for the original paper or documentation for **Cell2Fire** and any relevant studies that describe the **Sub20** and **Sub40** landscapes.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Cell2Fire Simulator**: 
   - Citation: Pais, C., Carrasco, J., Martell, D.L., Weintraub, A., Woodruff, D.L. (2021). *Cell2fire: A cell-based forest fire growth model to support strategic landscape management planning*. Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, 4, 692706.

2. **Sub20 Landscape**: 
   - Citation: Murray, L., Castillo, T., Carrasco, J., Weintraub, A., Weber, R., Martín de Diego, I., González, J.R., García-Gonzalo, J. (2023). *Advancing Forest Fire Prevention: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Effective Firebreak Placement*. [Include any specific citation details if available].

3. **Sub40 Landscape**: 
   - Citation: Murray, L., Castillo, T., Carrasco, J., Weintraub, A., Weber, R., Martín de Diego, I., González, J.R., García-Gonzalo, J. (2023). *Advancing Forest Fire Prevention: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Effective Firebreak Placement*. [Include any specific citation details if available].

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are clearly documented and formatted correctly for any further processing or review.
