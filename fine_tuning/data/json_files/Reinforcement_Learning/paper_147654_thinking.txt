To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Symbolic Machines: Learning Semantic Parsers on Freebase with Weak Supervision" by Chen Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present, and I should look for more details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the challenges of training neural networks for semantic parsing and highlight their results on the **WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset**. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their work.

I will then proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors provide a detailed description of the **WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset**. They mention that it contains 3,098 question-answer pairs for training and 1,639 for testing, collected using the Google Suggest API and annotated by workers familiar with Freebase. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the **WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset**. The authors cite it as follows:
> Wen-tau Yih, Matthew Richardson, Chris Meek, Ming-Wei Chang, and Jina Suh. *The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question answering*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Dataset Name**: WEBQUESTIONSSP
   - **Description**: Contains 3,098 question-answer pairs for training and 1,639 for testing, collected using Google Suggest API, with answers annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.
   - **Citation**: Wen-tau Yih, Matthew Richardson, Chris Meek, Ming-Wei Chang, and Jina Suh. *The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question answering*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
