To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Free Non-Stationary RL: Near-Optimal Regret and Applications in Multi-Agent RL and Inventory Control" by Weichao Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide initial insights into the datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details along with its citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
