To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Reasoning Based on Large Language Models for Autonomous Car Driving" by Mehdi Azarafza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of autonomous driving using the CARLA simulator, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulator or other datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their use of the CARLA simulator, which is an open-source platform for autonomous driving research. I will check if they reference any specific datasets used for training the YOLOv8 object detection model or any datasets used for evaluating the LLM's performance.

In the **background section**, the authors mention using CARLA as a simulation environment. I will look for any references to datasets that might be used within CARLA or any datasets that are commonly associated with it.

I will also check the **related work section** for any citations of datasets that other researchers have used in similar contexts. This could provide additional datasets that are relevant to the study.

Once I identify any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will then consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions the CARLA simulator, I will note that it is a dataset in itself, and I will provide the citation:
- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, Alexey, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Conference on robot learning, pages 1-16, 2017.

If the authors mention using YOLOv8, I will check if they reference any specific datasets used for training YOLOv8, such as the COCO dataset:
- **COCO Dataset**: 
  > Lin, Tsung-Yi, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasquez, et al. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
