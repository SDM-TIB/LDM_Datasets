To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Policy Learning with Routines Discovered from a Single Demonstration" by Zelin Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on Atari games and the CoinRun benchmark, which suggests that these could be datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **Atari benchmark** and **CoinRun**. I will need to gather more details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant citations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, indicating that they used **33 Atari games** selected from a specific source. This implies that there is a dataset associated with the Atari games, which is commonly known as the **Atari Learning Environment**. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

The authors also mention using the **CoinRun benchmark**, which is another dataset used for evaluating generalization in reinforcement learning. I will look for the citation for this benchmark as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets:

1. For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2012). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. CoRR.

2. For the **CoinRun benchmark**, the citation is:
   > Cobbe, K., Klimov, O., Hesse, C., Kim, T., & Schulman, J. (2018). Quantifying Generalization in Reinforcement Learning. CoRR.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
