To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting the Softmax Bellman Operator: New Benefits and New Perspective" by Zhao Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of the softmax Bellman operator in reinforcement learning and mentions testing on several games in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). This indicates that the ALE is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention testing on six Atari games: **Q*Bert, Ms. Pacman, Crazy Climber, Breakout, Asterix, and Seaquest**. This is a clear indication that these games are part of the dataset utilized for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, and I can find its citation as follows:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A standard large-scale deep reinforcement learning testbed that includes various Atari games used for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
