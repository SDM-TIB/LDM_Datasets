To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Memory Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach For Snake Game Autonomous Agents" by Md. Rafat Rahman Tushar and Shahnewaz Siddique, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a modified DRL method for the Snake game, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In the **Method** section, the authors describe their approach to image preprocessing and the use of a replay buffer, but they do not mention any specific datasets. However, they do refer to the "classical Snake game" as the environment for their experiments, which indicates that the game itself is the primary dataset used for training their model.

I will also check the **results and comparisons sections** to see if any external datasets are referenced for comparison purposes. The authors compare their results with those from other models, specifically mentioning the "baseline DQN model" and the "reÔ¨Åned DQN model," but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not provide any external datasets or references to datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note that the primary dataset is the Snake game environment itself, which is implemented using the 'pygame' module.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to see if any external works are cited that might provide datasets. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and deep learning, but they do not specifically mention datasets related to the Snake game.

In conclusion, the only dataset I can extract from this paper is the Snake game environment itself, which is not formally cited as a dataset in the traditional sense. Therefore, I will note that the authors utilized the Snake game as their experimental environment but did not provide a formal citation for it.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to extract, I will summarize my findings accordingly.
