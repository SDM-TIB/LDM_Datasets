To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Predictive Learning from Videos" by Geng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors constructed two new benchmarks based on RoboNet and KTH, which indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **RoboNet**: This dataset contains action-conditioned videos of robotic arms interacting with various objects in different environments. The authors specify that they divided the dataset into four continual learning tasks, collecting approximately 3,840 training sequences and 960 testing sequences for each task.

2. **KTH Action Dataset**: This dataset consists of gray-scale videos that include six types of human actions. The authors indicate that they used action labels to divide the dataset into six tasks, collecting about 1,500 training sequences and 800 testing sequences on average for each task.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RoboNet**, the citation is:
  > Sudeep Dasari, Frederik Ebert, Stephen Tian, Suraj Nair, Bernadette Bucher, Karl Schmeckpeper, Siddharth Singh, Sergey Levine, and Chelsea Finn. *RoboNet: Large-scale multi-robot learning*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), pages 885–897, 2019.

- For **KTH Action Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing human actions: A local SVM approach*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), pages 32–36, 2004.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations.
