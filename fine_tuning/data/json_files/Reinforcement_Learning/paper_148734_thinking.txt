To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepFoldit - A Deep Reinforcement Learning Neural Network Folding Proteins" by Dimitra Panou and Martin Reczko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of **Foldit**, which is a crowdsourcing approach for protein structure prediction, indicating that it may involve a dataset related to protein structures.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **Data section**, the authors describe their dataset, which consists of **40 proteins from the PDB database** obtained by the X-ray Diffraction method. They specify that these proteins have no sequence homologues with known structures, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's uniqueness.

The authors also mention that the dataset was split into a **training set** and a **test set**, with specific proteins listed for each. This is important for documenting the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset referenced is the **PDB database**, which is a well-known resource for protein structures. The citation for the PDB database is as follows:

- **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**:
  > Berman, H., et al. "The protein data Bank." *Nucleic acids research* 28.1 (2000): 235-242. URL: www.rcsb.org

Additionally, the authors mention the use of **Foldit** in their experiments, which is a crowdsourcing platform for protein folding. The citation for the Foldit game is:

- **Foldit**:
  > Cooper, S., et al. "Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game." *Nature* 466.7307 (2010): 756.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for any downstream processing or review.
