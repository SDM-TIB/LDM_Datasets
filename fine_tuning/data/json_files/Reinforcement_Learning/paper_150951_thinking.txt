To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic V2X Autonomous Perception from Road-to-Vehicle Vision" by Jiayao Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, AR2VP, on the **V2X-Sim dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe the data preparation and evaluation metrics. Here, they provide detailed information about the **V2X-Sim dataset**, including its structure, the number of scenarios, frames, and samples used for training and testing. This section confirms that the V2X-Sim dataset is the primary dataset utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the V2X-Sim dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **V2X-Sim Dataset**: 
  > Y. Li, Z. A., Dekun Ma; and Wang, Z. 2022. *V2X-Sim: Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception Dataset and Benchmark for Autonomous Driving*. RAL.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **V2X-Sim Dataset**: This dataset emulates multi-agent scenarios with 100 distinct scenes, each containing 100 frames captured at intervals of 0.2 seconds. The training set comprises 23,500 samples, while the test set contains 3,100 samples.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for the V2X-Sim dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
