To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hiding in Plain Sight: Towards the Science of Linguistic Steganography" by Leela Raj-Sankar and S. Raj Rajagopalan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the need for a representative dataset of verbal/spoken English, which suggests that a dataset is indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing the practical construction of steganography for tweets**. Here, the authors mention using a corpus of approximately **240,300 Tweets from the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to confirm the dataset's application in the research. The authors describe how they scrubbed the dataset of personal information and computed word frequencies, which further validates the use of this dataset in their methodology.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset. The citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will need to refer to external sources to obtain it. The correct citation for the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset is:

> Socher, Richard, et al. "Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank." In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, 2013. 

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution for the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset as part of the description. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
