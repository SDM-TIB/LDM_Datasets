To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Decentralizing Federated Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Robot Scenarios" by Jayprakash S. Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of decentralized federated learning in multi-robot scenarios, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of centralized federated learning and hints at the use of robots in different environments, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results** section, as this is often where datasets are described in detail. In this section, the authors mention that they used five identical personal computers connected via a LAN, each running a Tartarus agent platform and one Webots instantiation with a robot within its arena. They describe the different environments (Webots arenas) used for the experiments, which include variations in the number of obstacles present in each arena. However, they do not refer to any specific datasets by name.

I will also check the **methodology** and **discussion** sections to see if any datasets are referenced. The methodology describes the use of Q-learning and SARSA for reinforcement learning, but it does not specify any datasets. The discussion section mentions the potential for using different learning algorithms and the implications of the work, but again, no datasets are explicitly cited.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this research paper. However, I will note the environments used for the experiments, which could be considered as informal datasets for the purpose of understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant information about the environments used in the experiments, even if they are not formal datasets with citations.

In summary, I will document:
- The environments used for the experiments (Webots arenas with varying obstacles).
- The lack of formal datasets or citations in the paper.

This will provide a comprehensive overview of the data context within the research, even if specific datasets were not identified.
