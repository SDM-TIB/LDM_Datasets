To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hit and Lead Discovery with Explorative RL and Fragment-based Molecule Generation" by Soojung Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including any datasets used for training their models or for validation purposes. I will look for any specific names of datasets, such as "DUD-E" or "ChEMBL," and note their context.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that may be referenced when discussing the outcomes of their experiments. The authors might compare their results against benchmarks or previously established datasets, which is crucial for understanding the scope of their work.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **DUD-E dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> M. Mysinger, M. Carchia, J. J. Irwin, and B. K. Shoichet. "Directory of useful decoys, enhanced (DUD-E): better ligands and decoys for better benchmarking." *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, vol. 55, no. 14, pp. 6582–6594, 2012.

Similarly, if they reference the **ChEMBL database**, I will find its citation:
> A. Gaulton, L. J. Bellis, A. P. Bento, et al. "Chembl: a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery." *Nucleic Acids Research*, vol. 40, no. D1, pp. D1100–D1107, 2012.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper, maintaining a high standard of academic rigor.
