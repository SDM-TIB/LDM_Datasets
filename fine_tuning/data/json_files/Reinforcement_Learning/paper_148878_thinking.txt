To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Skills to Navigate without a Master: A Sequential Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" by Ambedkar Dukkipati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. They mention three specific environments:

1. **3D Navigation Environment**: This is a custom simulated environment developed by the authors, which is designed for testing their algorithm. I need to note that this is not a publicly available dataset but rather a simulation created for the purpose of the study.

2. **Duckietown Environment**: The authors refer to the Duckietown self-driving car simulator, which is a well-known environment in the reinforcement learning community. I will need to find the full citation for this environment.

3. **Atari River Raid Environment**: This is a classic environment used in reinforcement learning research. I will also need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for the Duckietown and Atari River Raid environments:

- For the **Duckietown Environment**, the citation is:
  > M. Chevalier-Boisvert, F. Golemo, Y. Cao, B. Mehta, and L. Paull. "Duckietown environments for openai gym." https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown, 2018.

- For the **Atari River Raid Environment**, the citation is:
  > V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. G. I. Antonoglou, D. Wierstra, and M. Riedmiller. "Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning." Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013.

Since the 3D Navigation Environment is a custom environment developed by the authors, it does not have a formal citation but is important to mention as part of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the Duckietown and Atari River Raid environments, while also noting the custom nature of the 3D Navigation Environment.
