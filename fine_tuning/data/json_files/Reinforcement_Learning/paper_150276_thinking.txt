To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-of-Information Minimization in IRS-aided and Wireless-powered Wireless Networks" by Shimin Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will pay special attention to sections that describe the experiments or simulations conducted, as they typically outline the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **simulated environment** for their experiments, which may not correspond to a publicly available dataset. However, they reference the use of **synthetic data** generated for their simulations. This is important to note, as synthetic datasets are often created for specific research purposes and may not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited works that may have provided datasets or methodologies for generating synthetic data. If the authors refer to any established datasets or benchmarks in their methodology, I will extract those citations as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets mentioned, even if they are synthetic or generated. If no formal datasets are cited, I will note that the experiments were conducted using synthetic data generated for the study.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation, if applicable, ready for structured output or further processing.
