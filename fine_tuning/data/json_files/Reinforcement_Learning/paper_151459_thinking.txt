To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformal Counterfactual Inference under Hidden Confounding" by Zonghao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method across **synthetic and real-world data**, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a synthetic data-generating process involving hidden confounding factors. They provide details about the number of samples and the structure of the data.

2. **Yahoo Dataset**: This dataset is used for counterfactual outcome estimation in recommendation systems. The authors provide specific statistics about the dataset, such as the number of training and calibration samples.

3. **Coat Dataset**: Similar to the Yahoo dataset, this dataset is also used for counterfactual outcome estimation and includes details about the number of samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Synthetic Dataset**, the authors do not provide a formal citation since it is generated for the purpose of the study. However, I will note the details provided in the paper.

For the **Yahoo Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yahoo! R31 dataset. Available at: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/

For the **Coat Dataset**, the citation is:
> Coat dataset. Available at: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/mnar/

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets from the paper:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated for the study, no formal citation.
2. **Yahoo Dataset**: Used for counterfactual outcome estimation.
   - Citation: Yahoo! R31 dataset. Available at: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/
3. **Coat Dataset**: Used for counterfactual outcome estimation.
   - Citation: Coat dataset. Available at: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/mnar/

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
