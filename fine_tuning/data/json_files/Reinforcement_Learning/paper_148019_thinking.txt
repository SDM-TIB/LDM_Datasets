To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Exploration in Soft-Actor-Critic with Normalizing Flows Policies" by Patrick Nadeem Ward et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of Normalizing Flow policies within the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in deep reinforcement learning but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the environments used for testing their methods. They mention using a **continuous two-dimensional grid world** environment, which is a simulation rather than a traditional dataset. The paper references the work of Oh et al. (2017) for this environment, indicating that it is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might provide additional context or references to datasets. The figures illustrate the performance of different policies in the grid world environments but do not introduce new datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any additional datasets beyond the continuous grid world environment, I will now gather the full citation for the referenced environment:

- For the **continuous grid world environment**, the citation is:
  > Oh, J., Singh, S., & Lee, H. (2017). Value prediction network. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 6118â€“6128).

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that the only relevant dataset-like reference is the continuous grid world environment, which is a standard benchmark in the field.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name and its citation for clarity and completeness.
