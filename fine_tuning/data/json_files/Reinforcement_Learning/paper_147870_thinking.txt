To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Multi-Step Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Study of the DQN Target" by J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia and Richard S. Sutton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on multi-step methods in deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention using the **mountain car environment** for their experiments. This environment is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, but it is not a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it is a simulation environment used to evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets beyond the mountain car environment, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets or environments used in the study. However, the references primarily cite foundational papers and algorithms rather than datasets.

The relevant citation for the mountain car environment is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is commonly associated with the following source:

- For the mountain car environment, the citation is:
  > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* (2nd ed.). MIT Press.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets or provide specific dataset citations, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Mountain Car Environment**: Used for evaluating the performance of multi-step algorithms in deep reinforcement learning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the mountain car environment as it is the only relevant dataset-like entity mentioned in the paper.
