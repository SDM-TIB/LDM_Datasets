To extract datasets from the research paper titled "V2N Service Scaling with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Cyril Shih-Huan Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a **real-world vehicular trace dataset**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific details about the dataset. In the **Performance Evaluation** section, the authors state that they consider a **real-world dataset with a traffic trace from Corso Orbassano road in Turin**, spanning from January 2020 to October 2020. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. However, the primary dataset appears to be the vehicular traffic trace from Turin.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required. The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Vehicular Traffic Trace Dataset**: This dataset contains traffic data from the Corso Orbassano road in Turin, collected from January 2020 to October 2020. It includes the number of cars passing certain measuring points every 5 minutes.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a real-world dataset used for the experiments but lacks a specific reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details, including the dataset name, description, and any citations if available. This will allow for easy reference and use in future work or analyses.
