To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PIPPI2021: An Approach to Automated Diagnosis and Texture Analysis of the Fetal Liver & Placenta in Fetal Growth Restriction" by Aya Mutaz Zeidan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are critical for the research. The authors may discuss previous studies or datasets that inform their work.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the data collection process. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For instance, the authors mention using MRI datasets for 12 normally grown and 12 FGR pregnancies, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets when discussing their findings. This can help confirm the datasets used and provide additional context about their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "DECIDE model" or "IVIM model," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
