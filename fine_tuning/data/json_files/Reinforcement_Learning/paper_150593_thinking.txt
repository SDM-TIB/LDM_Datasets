To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normalization Enhances Generalization in Visual Reinforcement Learning" by Lu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **DMControl Generalization Benchmark** and **CARLA**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, particularly in **section 5 (Experiments)**. Here, they explicitly mention the two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **DMControl Generalization Benchmark**: This benchmark is designed for evaluating generalization capabilities in robotic control tasks. It includes various tasks with visual disturbances, such as color changes and background replacements.

2. **CARLA**: This is a realistic autonomous driving simulator used to assess the performance of their method in complex driving scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DMControl Generalization Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details necessary for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help me compile the dataset entries effectively.
