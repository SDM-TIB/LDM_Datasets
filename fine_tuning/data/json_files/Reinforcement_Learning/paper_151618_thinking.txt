To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Periodic agent-state based Q-learning for POMDPs" by Amit Sinha, Mathieu Geist, and Aditya Mahajan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. I will look for any subsections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as they will likely contain the most pertinent information.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical experiments or examples that illustrate the application of the proposed method. These sections often include datasets used for validation or testing purposes.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for any future references or for others who may want to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a quick search to find the authoritative source for that dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information according to the specified requirements, making sure to double-check for accuracy and completeness before finalizing the output.
