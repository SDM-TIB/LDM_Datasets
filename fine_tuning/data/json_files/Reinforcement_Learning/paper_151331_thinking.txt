To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DriveCoT: Integrating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with End-to-End Driving" by Tianqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset named **DriveCoT**, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (DriveCoT Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's purpose, structure, and the types of data it contains. They mention that the DriveCoT dataset includes sensor data, control decisions, and chain-of-thought labels, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's application in end-to-end driving.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the **DriveCoT dataset**:
- It consists of 1058 scenarios and 36,000 labeled samples, collected at a frequency of 2 Hz.
- The dataset includes various challenging driving scenarios, such as high-speed driving and lane-changing.
- The data is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets with specific ratios.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DriveCoT dataset. The authors reference the CARLA simulator, which is used for data collection, and I will ensure to include this in the citation.

The full citation for the **DriveCoT dataset** is:
> Wang, T., Xie, E., Chu, R., Li, Z., & Luo, P. (2023). DriveCoT: Integrating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with End-to-End Driving. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). Project page: https://drivecot.github.io/.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the DriveCoT dataset, ready for further use or analysis.
