To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternating Minimization Converges Super-Linearly for Mixed Linear Regression" by Avishek Ghosh and Kannan Ramchandran, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or features.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of **synthetic datasets** generated from a mixture of linear regressions. They may not provide a specific dataset name but rather describe the methodology for generating these datasets. I will note this as a dataset type rather than a specific named dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used to generate them. If the authors refer to any established datasets or previous works that utilized specific datasets, I will extract those citations.

For the synthetic datasets, I will document the following:
- **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Mixture of Linear Regressions
- **Description**: Datasets generated from a mixture of two linear regressions with Gaussian covariates.
- **Citation**: Since this is a synthetic dataset generated by the authors, I will note the paper itself as the source.

If any other datasets are mentioned, I will follow the same process to extract their names, descriptions, and citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited according to academic standards.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identifying any specific datasets or types of datasets (like synthetic datasets).
3. Checking the references for any relevant citations.
4. Documenting the dataset names, descriptions, and citations accurately.

This systematic approach will ensure that I capture all relevant dataset information from the paper effectively.
