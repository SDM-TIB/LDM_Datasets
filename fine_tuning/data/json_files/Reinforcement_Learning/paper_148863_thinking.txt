To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fire Threat Detection From Videos with Q-Rough Sets" by Debarati B. Chakraborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of methods for fire detection from video streams but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of fire detection but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** and any subsequent sections that might detail the datasets used for validation. In this case, the authors mention that they conducted experiments with 30 different types of videos, including more than 25,000 video frames. They specifically reference the **Firesense database** and videos from **YouTube**. 

In the **experimental results section**, the authors describe the videos used for their experiments, including specific sequences like 'PosVideo1', 'PosVideo2', and others. They also mention that ten video sequences were acquired from the Firesense database, which is a key dataset for their work.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. **Firesense Database**:
   > Grammalidis, N., Dimitropoulos, K., & Cetin, E. (2017). Firesense database of videos for flame and smoke detection [data set]. In Zenodo, pages 466â€“470.

2. **YouTube Videos**:
   - For 'WeddingDress' video:
     > Inside Edition. (2018). Daring brides light wedding dresses on fire while wearing them. YouTube. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNdaJblEqiU
   - For 'ChristmasTree' video:
     > National Fire Protection Association. (2015). Christmas tree fires can turn devastating and deadly within seconds. YouTube. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr6b9b8FYKkt=5s

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- Firesense Database
- YouTube Videos (specifically 'WeddingDress' and 'ChristmasTree')

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
