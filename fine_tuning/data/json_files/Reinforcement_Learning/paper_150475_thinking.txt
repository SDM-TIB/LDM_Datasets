To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Optimal Infinite-Horizon Control of Probabilistic Boolean Control Networks" by Jingjie Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets used for validation or testing their proposed methods.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or testing their model, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

For each dataset, I will ensure to gather the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, number of samples, and any specific features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have compiled this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
