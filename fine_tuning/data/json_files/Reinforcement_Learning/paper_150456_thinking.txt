To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Path Following on Rivers Using Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning" by Niklas Paulig and Ostap Okhrina, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions validation on "real-world river data from the lower- and middle Rhine," indicating that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will check the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors provide more details about the datasets used. In the introduction, they discuss the challenges of path-following on inland waterways, but I need to find specific dataset names and descriptions.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention using "real-world data from the middle and lower Rhine" for validation. This suggests that the Rhine river data is a key dataset for their experiments. I will look for any specific details about this dataset, such as how it was collected or any specific characteristics.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to the datasets. The authors acknowledge the German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) for providing real-world depth and current data for the lower- and middle Rhine. This indicates that the dataset is likely sourced from this institute.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Lower Rhine Dataset**: This dataset includes real-world depth and current data collected from the lower Rhine river, which is used to validate the proposed path-following controller.

2. **Middle Rhine Dataset**: Similar to the lower Rhine dataset, this dataset contains real-world data from the middle Rhine river, also used for validation purposes.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will cite the source of the data as follows:

- For the **Lower Rhine Dataset**:
  > German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW). *Real-world depth and current data for the lower Rhine*. [URL if available].

- For the **Middle Rhine Dataset**:
  > German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW). *Real-world depth and current data for the middle Rhine*. [URL if available].

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and citations before compiling them into a structured format for further use.
