To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning With Reward Machines in Stochastic Games" by Jueming Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors may have used in their experiments.

Next, I will review the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they utilized for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that would help in understanding their context.

If the paper includes a **datasets** section, I will focus on that as it will likely contain explicit mentions of the datasets used. I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will find the corresponding citation for these datasets in the references. If they refer to a specific dataset created by other researchers, I will ensure to capture the original source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all entries are clear and complete.
