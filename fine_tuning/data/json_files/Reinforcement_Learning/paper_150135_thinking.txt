To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Timescale Transmission Design for RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems" by Jianxin Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the performance evaluation of a two-timescale transmission design, which may imply the use of specific datasets for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically outline the context and significance of their research. If any datasets are mentioned, they will likely be introduced here, especially if they are foundational to the study.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, as it often details the experimental setup and the datasets used for analysis. This section may include specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Following that, I will look into the **results** section, where the authors present their findings. This section may reference the datasets again, confirming their use and possibly providing additional details about their characteristics or performance metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to:
1. **Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems**: Any datasets that provide empirical data or simulations relevant to this technology.
2. **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)**: Datasets that may include performance metrics or channel models used in the context of RIS.

Once I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "COST 2100 channel model," I will ensure to include the complete citation as follows:

- **COST 2100 Channel Model**: 
  > COST Action 2100. *Wireless Communications: The Future of Wireless Communications*. [Online]. Available: [URL or DOI if available].

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source, ready for further processing or review.
