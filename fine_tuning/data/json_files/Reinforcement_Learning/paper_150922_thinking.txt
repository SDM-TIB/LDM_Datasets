To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can bin-wise scaling improve consistency and adaptivity of prediction uncertainty for machine learning regression?" by Pascal Pernot, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a benchmark dataset for the prediction of atomization energies, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Results)**, where the author explicitly states the use of the **QM9 dataset**. This dataset is described as containing predicted atomization energies, uncertainties, reference values, and molecular formulas as input features. The author also mentions that the validation set and test set of uncalibrated predictions were provided by J. Busk et al., which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **acknowledgments** section, where the author thanks Jonas Busk for providing the data for the study. This reinforces the importance of the QM9 dataset in the context of the research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The QM9 dataset is referenced in the paper by Busk et al. as follows:

- For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Busk, P. B. JÃ¸rgensen, A. Bhowmik, M. N. Schmidt, O. Winther, and T. Vegge. *Calibrated uncertainty for molecular property prediction using ensembles of message passing neural networks*. Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol., 3:015012, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the dataset used in the research paper.
