To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Distillation" by Andrei A. Rusu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of policy distillation in the Atari domain, which suggests that datasets related to Atari games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In the results section, the authors refer to "ten popular Atari games" that were selected for their experiments. This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these games.

I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of the games used in the experiments. The paper states that the authors trained DQN agents on various Atari games, including "Breakout," "Pong," "Q*bert," and others. Each of these games represents a distinct dataset used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will refer to the original DQN paper by Mnih et al. (2015), which is the foundational work for the Atari datasets used in reinforcement learning.

The citation for the DQN paper is:
> Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, Ioannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, and Martin A. Riedmiller. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529â€“533, 02 2015.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Atari Games Dataset**: This dataset consists of various Atari games used for training reinforcement learning agents. The specific games mentioned in the paper include:
   - Breakout
   - Pong
   - Q*bert
   - Freeway
   - Ms. Pacman
   - Seaquest
   - Riverraid
   - Space Invaders
   - Enduro
   - Beamrider

Now, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the DQN paper as the authoritative source for the Atari datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
