To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rationale-Sensitive Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Multi-hop Fact Verification" by Yingjie Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention the use of counterfactual data augmentation techniques and the evaluation of their method on various datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **HOVER**: A dataset for multi-hop fact verification sourced from Wikipedia, which challenges models to extract relevant evidence and verify claims. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yingjie Zhu, Jiasheng Si, Yibo Zhao, Haiyang Zhu, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He. *HoVer: A dataset for many-hop fact extraction and claim verification*. In Proceedings of Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP, pages 3441–3460, 2020.

2. **FEVER**: A large-scale fact verification dataset with claims generated from Wikipedia sentences. The citation is:
   > James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Arpit Mittal. *FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and VERification*. In Proceedings of the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 809–819, 2018.

3. **FEVEROUS**: A multi-hop fact verification dataset consisting of claims verified against Wikipedia pages. The citation is:
   > Rami Aly, Zhijiang Guo, Michael Schlichtkrull, James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Arpit Mittal. *Feverous: Fact extraction and verification over unstructured and structured information*. In Proceedings of the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, 2021.

4. **PolitiHop**: A dataset of real-world claims with manual annotations of evidence from PolitiFact articles. The citation is:
   > Wojciech Ostrowski, Arnav Arora, Pepa Atanasova, and Isabelle Augenstein. *Multi-hop fact checking of political claims*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 3892–3898, 2021.

5. **SCIFACT**: A scientific fact verification dataset with expert-written claims paired with evidence. The citation is:
   > David Wadden, Shanchuan Lin, Kyle Lo, Lucy Lu Wang, Madeleine van Zuylen, Arman Cohan, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Fact or fiction: Verifying scientific claims*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 7534–7550, 2020.

6. **HealthVer**: An evidence-based fact verification dataset for health-related claims. The citation is:
   > Mourad Sarrouti, Asma Ben Abacha, Yassine Mrabet, and Dina Demner-Fushman. *Evidence-based fact-checking of health-related claims*. In Proceedings of Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021, pages 3499–3512.

7. **PubHealth**: A dataset for explainable fact verification in public health. The citation is:
   > Neema Kotonya and Francesca Toni. *Explainable automated fact-checking for public health claims*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 7740–7754, 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations and details for each. I will also check the **references section** of the paper to confirm the accuracy of the citations and gather any additional information that may be relevant.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
