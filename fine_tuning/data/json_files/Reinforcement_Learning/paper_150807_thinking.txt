To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Machine Learning and Physics based Machine Learning approach for prediction of peak temperature distribution in Additive Friction Stir Deposition of Aluminium Alloy" by Akshansh Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or testing machine learning models.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to analyze the peak temperature distribution or deposition quality. The introduction often outlines the context of the research and may specify datasets that are foundational to the study.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods section** closely, as it typically details the experimental setup and may explicitly mention the datasets used. In this paper, the author mentions that data was prepared and imported to Google Colab for machine learning algorithms, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

I will also check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The author discusses various machine learning algorithms and their performance metrics, which may reference specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Dataset for Peak Temperature Prediction**: The paper mentions that the data was prepared for machine learning algorithms, including parameters like Rotational Rate, Travel Speed, and Deposition Material Flow Rate. However, the specific dataset name is not provided in the text.

2. **Dataset for Deposition Quality Prediction**: The author discusses using various machine learning algorithms to classify deposition quality based on input features. Again, the specific dataset name is not mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are likely derived from experimental data related to the Additive Friction Stir Deposition process, but I will not be able to provide full citations without specific dataset names.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references section that may pertain to the datasets used in the study.
