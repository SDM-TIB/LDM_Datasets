To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEANing Cygnus A deep and fast with R2D2" by Arwa Dabbech et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on real data for imaging the radio galaxy Cygnus A, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Application to Cygnus A)**, where the authors describe the data acquisition and imaging settings. Here, they mention that the Cygnus A data were acquired at S band (2.052 GHz) using the Very Large Array (VLA). They provide specific details about the observation settings, including the total observation duration and the configurations used.

In this section, the authors also describe the training dataset used for the R2D2 variants, which consists of 20,000 pairs of ground truth images and associated dirty images. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training process of their deep learning models.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Cygnus A Observations**: The data used for imaging Cygnus A, acquired at S band with the VLA. This dataset is essential for demonstrating the effectiveness of the R2D2 method.

2. **Training Dataset for R2D2**: Composed of 20,000 pairs of ground truth images and associated dirty images, created from a low-dynamic range database of optical astronomy and medical images.

Next, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **Cygnus A observations**, the citation is:
  > Dabbech, A., Aghabiglou, A., Chu, C. S., & Wiaux, Y. (2024). *Cygnus A reconstructions at S band with R2D2*. doi: 10.17861/76034345-9e4d-488f-9558-3bd7674f41ee.

- For the **training dataset**, the authors reference the creation of synthetic ground truth images and the methods used, which are detailed in:
  > Terris, M., Dabbech, A., Tang, C., & Wiaux, Y. (2022). *MNRAS, 518, 604*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and ready for use.
