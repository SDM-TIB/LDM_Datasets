To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Continual Learning" by Sayna Ebrahimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the proposed methods.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **5-Split MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, split into 5 tasks, each containing 2 classes. It is commonly used for evaluating continual learning methods.

2. **Permuted MNIST**: Another variant of the MNIST dataset where the pixels are randomly permuted for each task. This dataset is also widely used in continual learning research.

3. **20-Split CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of the CIFAR100 dataset divided into 20 tasks, each containing 5 classes. It is used to assess the performance of continual learning algorithms.

4. **20-Split miniImageNet**: This dataset is derived from the miniImageNet dataset, split into 20 tasks, each containing 5 classes. It is a benchmark for evaluating continual learning methods.

5. **5-Datasets**: This refers to a sequence of datasets including MNIST, not-MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN, used to evaluate the model's performance across multiple tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For example, the citations for the datasets mentioned might look like this:

- **5-Split MNIST**: 
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- **Permuted MNIST**: 
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- **CIFAR100**: 
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Tech. rep.*, Citeseer.

- **miniImageNet**: 
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 3630-3638.

- **5-Datasets**: 
  > Various authors for each dataset (MNIST, not-MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
