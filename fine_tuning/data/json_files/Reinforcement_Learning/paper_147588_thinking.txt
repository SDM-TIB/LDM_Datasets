To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable lower bound for expected BLEU score" by Vlad Zhukov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of BLEU score as a metric for evaluating models in natural language processing, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of using non-differentiable metrics and mentions benchmark metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In section 4.2, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **IWSLT’14 dataset**: This dataset consists of German-English sentence pairs and is referenced in the context of preprocessing sentences. The authors state that they performed the same preprocessing as in a previous work.

2. **WMT’14 dataset**: This is another dataset of German-English sentence pairs, which is larger than the IWSLT’14 dataset. The authors mention that they used preprocessed data from a specific reference.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IWSLT’14 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stuker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th iwslt evaluation campaign, iwslt 2014*. 

- For the **WMT’14 dataset**, the citation is:
  > ACL2014. *Ninth workshop on statistical machine translation*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
