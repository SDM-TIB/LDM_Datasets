To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Advantage Actor-Critic for Recommender Systems" by Xin Xin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **RC15 Dataset**: This dataset is based on the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains session-based data with a total of 200,000 sequences, 26,702 items, 1,110,965 clicks, and 43,946 purchases.

2. **RetailRocket Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a real-world e-commerce website and includes 195,523 sequences, 70,852 items, 1,176,680 clicks, and 57,269 purchases.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, in this case, the datasets are not associated with specific papers in the references, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of recommender systems. Therefore, I will provide the citations based on the dataset sources mentioned in the paper:

- For the **RC15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2015. *http://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/*.

- For the **RetailRocket Dataset**, the citation is:
  > RetailRocket. *https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
