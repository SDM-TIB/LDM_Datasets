To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Essay Scoring Using Transformer Models" by Sabrina Ludwig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the analysis is based on **2,088 email responses** to a problem-solving task, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they describe the dataset derived from the study "Domain-Specific Problem-Solving Competence for Industrial Clerks (DomPL-IK)" conducted in 2014, which includes 780 vocational and educational training students. The dataset consists of 2,088 non-empty email responses written in German, with specific details about the nature of the tasks and the scoring process.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DomPL-IK dataset. The authors reference the study by Rausch et al. (2016) for the dataset, which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Rausch, A.; Seifried, J.; Wuttke, E.; KÃ¶gler, K.; Brandt, S. *Reliability and Validity of a Computer-Based Assessment of Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Facets of Problem-Solving Competence in the Business Domain*. Empirical research in vocational education and training 2016, 8, 9.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the data section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references for any datasets mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and completeness.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
