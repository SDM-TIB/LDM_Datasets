To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Problem Solving with Large Language Models" by Sina Gholamian and Domingo Huh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case studies sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may mention datasets used in prior work or relevant studies, which could guide me to the datasets utilized in this research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach. This section often includes details about the datasets used for training or testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **case studies section**, the authors provide two detailed examples: the "Research Scientist Workflow" and the "Legal Matter Intake Workflow." I will examine these case studies closely to see if they reference any datasets used to simulate or evaluate the workflows. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for each dataset. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Research Scientist Workflow Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will check if it is derived from another source and provide that citation instead.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on the importance of full citations for each dataset.
