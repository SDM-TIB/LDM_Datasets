To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Learning from Forbidden Actions" by Mathieu Seurin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on a "Visual Grid World Environment" and the "TextWorld domain," indicating that these environments may serve as datasets or benchmarks for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) to gather more details about these environments. In this section, the authors describe the **MiniGrid Environment** and **TextWorld** in detail:

1. **MiniGrid Environment**: This is a visual grid world where the agent navigates to reach a goal. The authors reference a previous work for this environment:
   > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Bahdanau, D., Lahlou, S., Willems, L., Saharia, C., Nguyen, T. H., and Bengio, Y. (2019). *BabyAI: First steps towards grounded language learning with a human in the loop*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

2. **TextWorld**: This is a text-based game environment where the agent interacts using sentences. The authors cite the following reference for this environment:
   > Côté, M.-A., Kádár, A., Yuan, X., Kybartas, B., Barnes, T., Fine, E., Moore, J., Hausknecht, M., Asri, L. E., Adada, M., Tay, W., and Trischler, A. (2018). *Textworld: A learning environment for text-based games*. CoRR, abs/1806.11532.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **references section** of the paper for the complete citations of the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source. This will allow for a structured representation of the datasets used in the research.
