To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust and Reliable Algorithmic Recourse" by Sohini Upadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on "multiple synthetic and real-world datasets." This indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention three real-world datasets used for evaluation:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is described as capturing demographic, personal, and financial details of about 1000 loan applicants, with labels indicating good or bad credit risk.

2. **Small Business Administration (SBA) Case Dataset**: This dataset contains information on 2102 small business loans approved in California from 1989 to 2012, capturing various features related to the businesses and their loan statuses.

3. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset includes records of 649 students from two Portuguese secondary schools, containing academic and demographic information, with labels indicating above-average performance.

In addition to these real-world datasets, the authors also mention the use of **synthetic datasets** generated for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific name for the synthetic dataset, as it is generated based on a defined process rather than being a pre-existing dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **SBA Case Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, M., Mickel, A., & Taylor, S. (2018). “Should this loan be approved or denied?”: A large dataset with class assignment guidelines. *Journal of Statistics Education*, 26(1), 55–66. doi: 10.1080/10691898.2018.1434342.

- For the **Student Performance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cortez, P., & Silva, A. (2008). Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance. In A. Brito & J. Teixeira (Eds.), *Proceedings of 5th FUture BUsiness TEChnology Conference*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
