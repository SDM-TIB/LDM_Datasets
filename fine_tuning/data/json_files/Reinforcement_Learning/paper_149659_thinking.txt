To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improvements to Gradient Descent Methods for Quantum Tensor Network Machine Learning" by Fergus Barratt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of tensor networks in various machine learning problems, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction mentions the application of QTNML to problems like image classification, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors state that they consider the image classification problem of the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 28 Ã— 28 grayscale images of digits from zero through nine. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically standardized. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
