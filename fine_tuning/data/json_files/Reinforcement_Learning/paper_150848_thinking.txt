To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory in Plain Sight: Surveying the Uncanny Resemblances of Associative Memory and Diffusion Models" by Benjamin Hoover et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and any sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

If the paper includes a **table or figure** summarizing the datasets, I will pay close attention to that as it often condenses important information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
