To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis and Optimization for RIS-Aided Multi-Pair Communications Relying on Statistical CSI" by Zhangjie Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may contain hints about the datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors explicitly mention any datasets used for their simulations or analyses. This is often where researchers detail the datasets they employed to validate their findings.

In this paper, the authors discuss simulation parameters and results, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they refer to parameters such as the Rician factor, angles of arrival (AoA), angles of departure (AoD), and large-scale fading coefficients, which are typically derived from theoretical models rather than specific datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the study. This could include foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in the field of RIS-aided communications.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that several papers are cited, but they primarily discuss methodologies and theoretical frameworks rather than providing datasets. Therefore, I will note that while the paper does not provide specific datasets, it references several works that may contain relevant data or methodologies.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, even if they are not explicitly named, and provide full citations for the referenced works that could be useful for future research or dataset acquisition.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not directly provide datasets but references several key works in the field. I will ensure to include full citations for these references to assist in locating potential datasets.

Here are the relevant citations from the references section:

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for datasets and provided useful references for further exploration.
