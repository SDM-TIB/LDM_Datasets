To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI system for fetal ultrasound in low-resource settings" by Ryan G. Gomes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of an AI system using "novice-acquired 'blind sweep' ultrasound videos," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of fetal ultrasound and the challenges faced in low-resource settings. They mention using "two prospectively collected fetal ultrasound datasets" for their study, indicating that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **methods section**, I will look for a subsection that explicitly discusses the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the "Fetal Age Machine Learning Initiative (FAMLI) cohort" and the "Novice User Study" datasets. They provide details about the data collection sites, the number of participants, and the purpose of these datasets.

1. **Fetal Age Machine Learning Initiative (FAMLI) Dataset**: This dataset includes ultrasound data collected from study sites in Chapel Hill, NC, USA. It is used to develop technology for estimating gestational age. The data collection occurred between September 2018 and June 2021.

2. **Novice User Study Dataset**: This dataset was collected from Lusaka, Zambia, and focuses on ultrasound data acquired by novice operators. It also aims to estimate gestational age and evaluate the performance of the AI models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **FAMLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > FAMLI. UNC Global Womenâ€™s Health. https://gwh.web.unc.edu/famli/ (2018).

- For the **Novice User Study**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is implied to be part of the same research initiative and can be referenced as:
  > Gomes, R. G., Vwalika, B., Lee, C., Willis, A., et al. *AI system for fetal ultrasound in low-resource settings*. (2023).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
