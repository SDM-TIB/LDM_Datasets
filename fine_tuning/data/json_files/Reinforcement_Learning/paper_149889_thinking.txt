To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Reinforcement Learning: Linear Speedup Under Markovian Sampling" by Sajad Khodadadian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections explicitly dedicated to datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the identified sections, I will extract relevant information about each dataset, including:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
   - Any specific metrics or benchmarks associated with the dataset.

4. **Check References for Citations**: After gathering the dataset information, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document the Findings**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The dataset name.
   - A description of the dataset.
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets have been captured and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
