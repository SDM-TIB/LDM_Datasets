To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Reinforcement Learning in a Simulated Robotic Arm" by Luka Kovač and Igor Farkaš, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Safety Gym library and mentions a customized environment with a Panda robotic arm, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets. They mention the Safety Gym library, which includes various agent types and tasks, but I need to confirm if specific datasets are referenced.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their use of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with the panda-gym robotics arm. They mention that the environment is compatible with OpenAI Safety Gym, but I need to check if they provide specific datasets or environments that were used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the **panda-gym** environment, which is a simulation environment for robotic arms. They also mention that they implemented additional arms (xarm and kuka) for training with safety algorithms. However, they do not provide specific datasets in the traditional sense (like image or video datasets) but rather refer to simulation environments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find citations for the environments and tools mentioned. The Safety Gym library is referenced, and I will need to provide its citation as it is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

The citation for the Safety Gym library is:
> Ray, A., Achiam, J., Amodei, D. *Benchmarking safe exploration in deep reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.01708 (2019).

Additionally, I will cite the panda-gym environment, which is mentioned in the paper. The citation for panda-gym is:
> Kovač, L., & Farkaš, I. *Panda Gym: A Robotic Arm Environment for Reinforcement Learning*. GitHub repository. Available at: https://github.com/lukakovac99/robotic-arm-safeRL.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention traditional datasets but rather focuses on simulation environments, I will summarize the relevant environments used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the environments and their citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset or environment referenced in the paper.
