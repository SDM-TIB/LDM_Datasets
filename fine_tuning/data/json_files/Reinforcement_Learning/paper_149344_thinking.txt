To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the Real Robot Challenge using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Robert McCarthy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the "Real Robot Challenge," which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this challenge.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the Real Robot Challenge (RRC) and its goals. They mention that participants have access to a simulated version of the robotic setup, which indicates that there may be datasets related to the simulation environment or the challenge itself.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe their training process and the use of simulation, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they refer to the "Move Cube on Trajectory" task, which is part of the RRC, and I will need to check if this task is associated with any specific datasets.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors provide any performance metrics or evaluations based on specific datasets. They mention their performance in the RRC, but again, there are no specific datasets named.

To ensure I have not missed any datasets, I will review the **references section** for any papers that might describe datasets related to the Real Robot Challenge or the simulated environments used in their experiments. 

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they refer to the Real Robot Challenge and the simulated environments, which are critical for understanding the context of their work.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will note that the primary dataset is the Real Robot Challenge itself, which is a competition framework rather than a traditional dataset. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this challenge, but I can reference the official website for the challenge as follows:

- Real Robot Challenge: 
  > Real Robot Challenge. Available at: https://real-robot-challenge.com

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it references the Real Robot Challenge as the primary context for their experiments. I will document this information accordingly.
