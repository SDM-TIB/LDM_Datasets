To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Markov Decision Process modeled with Bandits for Sequential Decision Making in Linear-flow" by Wenjun Zeng and Yi Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and simulation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the problem formulation but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (RL Policy and Policy Updating)**, where the authors mention "Dùëë denotes the dataset for updating contextual Bandit for Page ùëë." This indicates that there are datasets used for the algorithm's training and evaluation, but I need to find more details about these datasets.

In **section 3 (Simulation)**, the authors describe the simulation data generation process. They mention generating simulation data based on a Probit link function and using parameters to control the importance of content recommendations. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for any datasets, I will need to note that the authors primarily used simulated data for their experiments. The simulation data is generated based on specific equations and parameters rather than being sourced from an existing dataset.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references primarily discuss algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not provide specific datasets with full citations, as it relies on simulated data for its experiments. Therefore, I will document that the primary dataset used is simulated data generated for the study, and no external datasets were referenced.

Now, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets in a structured format, noting the absence of specific dataset citations.
