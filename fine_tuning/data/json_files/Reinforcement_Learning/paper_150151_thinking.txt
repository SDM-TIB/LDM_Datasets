To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-MCTS: Deep Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning by Planning with Epistemic Uncertainty" by Yaniv Oren, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, and Wendelin Böhmer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on a benchmark hard-exploration task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Deep Sea** environment as a benchmark for their experiments. This is a specific dataset or environment that is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will also check the **background and related work sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or if there are any standard datasets commonly used in the context of the research discussed. However, the primary focus here is on the Deep Sea environment.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Deep Sea environment. The paper cites the following reference for the Deep Sea benchmark:

- For the **Deep Sea environment**, the citation is:
  > Ian Osband, Yotam Doron, Matteo Hessel, John Aslanides, Eren Sezener, Andre Saraiva, Katrina McKinney, Tor Lattimore, Csaba Szepesvári, Satinder Singh, Benjamin Van Roy, Richard Sutton, David Silver, and Hado van Hasselt. *Behaviour suite for reinforcement learning*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygf-kSYwH.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
