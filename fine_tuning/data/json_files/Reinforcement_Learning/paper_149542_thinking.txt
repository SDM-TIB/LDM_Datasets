To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Attention Learning Approach to Antenna Tilt Optimization" by Yifei Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the optimization of antenna tilt and mentions the use of a simulation environment, which may imply the presence of datasets related to network parameters or simulation results.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental setup** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **Section V**. Here, they mention running experiments in a proprietary mobile network simulation environment, which suggests that the data used for training and evaluation might be derived from this simulation.

In **Table I**, the authors provide parameters for the simulation environment, including the number of cells, users, and other relevant metrics. However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets. Instead, they refer to the simulation environment as the source of their data.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the data used is generated from their own simulation environment rather than from established datasets. This is an important distinction to make in the dataset extraction process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of previous works on reinforcement learning and antenna optimization, and do not point to any specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Data**: The authors used data generated from a proprietary mobile network simulation environment, which is not publicly available as a dataset.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations for datasets. Instead, I will note that the data is derived from their own simulation, which is a critical aspect of their research methodology.

This thorough examination ensures that I accurately represent the data sources used in the study while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
