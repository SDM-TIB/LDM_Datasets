To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing the Ranking Context of Dense Retrieval through Reciprocal Nearest Neighbors" by George Zerveas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "two large-scale ad hoc text retrieval datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a large-scale dataset sourced from open-domain logs of the Bing search engine. It contains about 8.8 million passages and is used for training and evaluating models.

2. **TripClick Dataset**: This dataset is described as a health document retrieval dataset based on click logs, referring to approximately 1.5 million MEDLINE articles. It includes around 700,000 unique queries and is split into subsets based on query frequency.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder, Andrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Alina Stoica, Saurabh Tiwary, and Tong Wang. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. arXiv:1611.09268 [cs], 2018.

- For the **TripClick Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Navid Rekabsaz, Simone Kopeinik, and Markus Schedl. *TripClick: The Log Files of a Large Health Web Search Engine*. In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 2507–2513, 2021.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Retrieval Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for training and evaluating retrieval models.
   - Citation: Payal Bajaj et al. (2018). *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. arXiv:1611.09268 [cs].

2. **TripClick Dataset**: A health document retrieval dataset based on click logs.
   - Citation: Navid Rekabsaz et al. (2021). *TripClick: The Log Files of a Large Health Web Search Engine*. In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 2507–2513.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
