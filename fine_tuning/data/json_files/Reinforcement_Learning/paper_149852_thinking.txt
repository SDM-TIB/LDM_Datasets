To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concentration bounds for SSP Q-learning for average cost MDPs" by Shaan ul Haque and Vivek S. Borkar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and any **dedicated sections** that discuss datasets or experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss Q-learning and its applications but do not mention specific datasets. I will then look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a **"Datasets"** or **"Experiments"** section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical experiments described in **Section V (Comparison with RVI Q-learning and Simulation Results)**. Here, the authors mention using two controlled Markov chains with 20 states and 5 actions in each state as examples for their simulations. This indicates that they have created synthetic datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the datasets are synthetic and not derived from previously published datasets, there may not be formal citations for them. In this case, I will note that the datasets are generated for the purpose of the study and provide a description of how they were constructed.

The datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Controlled Markov Chain Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of a transition matrix generated randomly, ensuring that it is irreducible under any policy. It has 20 states and 5 actions.

2. **Controlled Markov Chain Dataset 2**: Similar to the first dataset, this one also has 20 states and 5 actions. However, 50% of the entries in the transition matrix were set to zero, except for specific entries to maintain irreducibility.

Since these datasets are synthetic and created for the experiments, I will note that they do not have formal citations but provide a description of their construction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the nature of the datasets and their construction methods.
