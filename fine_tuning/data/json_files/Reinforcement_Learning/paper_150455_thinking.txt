To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preserving Linear Separability in Continual Learning by Backward Feature Projection" by Qiao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on "Split-CIFAR10," "Split-CIFAR100," and "Split TinyImageNet." This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Split CIFAR-10**: This dataset is derived from the original CIFAR-10 dataset, which is divided into 5 tasks, each containing 2 classes. Each class includes 5000 training images and 1000 testing images of size 32x32.

2. **Split CIFAR-100**: Similar to Split CIFAR-10, this dataset is a division of CIFAR-100 into 10 tasks, with each task containing 10 classes. Each class has 500 training images and 100 testing images, also of size 32x32.

3. **Split TinyImageNet**: This dataset splits TinyImageNet into 10 tasks, with each task containing 20 classes. Each class consists of 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 testing images.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge, CS231N course*, CS231N.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
