To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness Aware Counterfactuals for Subgroups" by Loukas Kavouras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "different benchmark datasets" for evaluating the proposed framework, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains specific information about the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and their relevance to the experiments conducted.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate fairness in the context of gender and race. It includes various demographic features and is commonly used in fairness research.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for assessing fairness in criminal justice risk assessments. It contains features related to criminal history and demographic information.

3. **SSL Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze fairness in the context of criminal activity predictions. It includes various predictor features related to criminal behavior.

4. **Ad Campaign Dataset**: This dataset is employed to evaluate fairness in advertising algorithms, focusing on gender as a protected attribute.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2013.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Aif360. *COMPAS dataset documentation*. Available at: https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/aif360.sklearn.datasets.fetch_compas.html.

- For the **SSL Dataset**:
  > Samuel Yeom. *Chicago SSL dataset*. Available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuel-yeom/fliptest/master/exact-ot/chicago-ssl-clean.csv.

- For the **Ad Campaign Dataset**:
  > IBM. *Bias in advertising dataset*. Available at: https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/bias-in-advertising/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
