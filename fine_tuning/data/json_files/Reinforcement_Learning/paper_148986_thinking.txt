To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible MPC-based Conflict Resolution Using Online Adaptive ADMM" by Jerry An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses simulations conducted in CARLA, which suggests that there may be a dataset or simulation environment involved.

Next, I will check the **methodology and simulation setup sections** for any specific datasets or simulation environments used. The paper mentions using CARLA, an open-source vehicle simulator, for simulations. This indicates that CARLA itself is a dataset or simulation environment relevant to the research.

In the **results section**, the authors compare their method against other decentralized conflict resolution methods (AMP-IP and TDCR) and provide performance metrics. However, they do not mention any additional datasets beyond CARLA.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for CARLA, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the research. The CARLA simulator is referenced in the context of the simulations but may not have a specific citation in the references section. However, I can find the official CARLA GitHub repository or documentation to provide a proper citation.

The citation for CARLA is:
> CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator. Available at: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla

Since CARLA is the primary dataset or simulation environment used in this research, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CARLA, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I followed include:
1. Reading through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections to identify datasets.
2. Noting that CARLA is the primary simulation environment used.
3. Finding the proper citation for CARLA to include in the dataset documentation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for CARLA, ensuring it is ready for review or further processing.
