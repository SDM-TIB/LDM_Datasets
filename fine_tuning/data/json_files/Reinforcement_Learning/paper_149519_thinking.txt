To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Sample Analysis of Decentralized Q-Learning for Stochastic Games" by Zuguang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used for validation or comparison. I will take note of any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections usually contain information about the datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study. I will look for sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used well-known datasets in the field of reinforcement learning or stochastic games. I will ensure to capture the full citation format as required.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.
