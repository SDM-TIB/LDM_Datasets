To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gap-Increasing Policy Evaluation for Efficient and Noise-Tolerant Reinforcement Learning" by Tadashi Kozuno et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will focus on that section for comprehensive details.

While reviewing these sections, I will take note of any figures, tables, or references that may provide additional context or information about the datasets. For instance, if the authors mention using a specific environment or benchmark, I will ensure to capture that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned. I will look for the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived, ensuring that I include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **OpenAI Gym** environment, I would find the citation for it, which is:
> Brockman, Greg, et al. "OpenAI Gym." 2016.

If the paper refers to a specific dataset like **NChain** or **FrozenLake**, I would ensure to cite the original source or documentation that describes these environments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness. This will involve summarizing each dataset's key features and providing the corresponding citations in a consistent manner.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper, adhering to academic standards for citation and data reporting.
