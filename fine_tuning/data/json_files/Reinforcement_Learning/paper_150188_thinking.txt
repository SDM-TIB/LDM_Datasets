To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial counterfactual identification and uplift modeling: theoretical results and real-world assessment" by Th√©o Verhelst et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "large real-world customer data set provided by a telecom company," which suggests that there is a dataset relevant to their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific details about this dataset in the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. The introduction discusses counterfactuals and uplift modeling, but I need to find concrete references to datasets. In the methodology section, the authors describe the data set used for their analysis, which includes 11,268 samples and 145 features related to customer churn prevention campaigns.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide further details about the dataset, such as its characteristics or how it was used in their experiments. They mention that the dataset includes customer features like tariff plans, call history, and socio-demographic information, which confirms its relevance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and provided by a telecom company, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note it as follows:

- **Customer Churn Dataset**: A dataset provided by a telecom company for analyzing customer churn prevention campaigns, containing 11,268 samples and 145 features.

Since there are no formal citations for proprietary datasets, I will document it as described above.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant information about its source or characteristics.
