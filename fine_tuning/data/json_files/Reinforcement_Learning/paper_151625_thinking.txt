To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced Safety in Autonomous Driving: Integrating Latent State Diffusion Model for End-to-End Navigation" by Detian Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of ensuring safety in autonomous driving, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach and any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail their experimental setup, including the use of the **CARLA simulator** for testing various safety-critical scenarios. They describe specific scenarios such as Traffic Negotiation, Highway, Obstacle Avoidance, and Braking and Lane Changing, but I need to determine if these scenarios are based on existing datasets or if they are generated within the simulator.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The authors mention using the CARLA simulator, which is an open-source platform for autonomous driving research. I will need to include the citation for CARLA as a dataset.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: This is the primary environment used for the experiments, providing realistic urban simulations for autonomous driving research.
   - Citation: 
     > E. Leurent, “An environment for autonomous driving decision-making,” https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will conclude my extraction here. I will ensure that the citation for the CARLA simulator is included in the final output.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
