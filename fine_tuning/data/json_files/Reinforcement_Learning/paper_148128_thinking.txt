To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Shared Experience Replay" by Simon Schmitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using **Atari games** and **DMLab-30** as environments for their experiments. I will note these as datasets, as they are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Atari Games**: The Atari Learning Environment is a widely recognized benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 2013.

2. **DMLab-30**: This dataset is part of the DeepMind Lab suite, which is also a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning. The citation for DMLab-30 is:
   > Charles Beattie, Joel Z. Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, Julian Schrittwieser, Keith Anderson, Sarah York, Max Cant, Adam Cain, Adrian Bolton, Stephen Gaffney, Helen King, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Stig Petersen. *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper attribution.
