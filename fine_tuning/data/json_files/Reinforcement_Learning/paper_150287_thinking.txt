To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data-Driven Gaussian Process Filter for Electrocardiogram Denoising" by Mircea Dumitru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed filter is evaluated on the **PhysioNet QT Database**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of ECG denoising and mentions the use of Gaussian processes, but it primarily reiterates the focus on the QT database.

In the **methods** section, particularly in **section III (Results)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **PhysioNet QT Database (QTDB)** for evaluating their filter. They describe the dataset as consisting of 15 minutes of 2-lead ECGs sampled at 250 Hz, which provides important details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to confirm that the QTDB is the only dataset used and to gather any additional insights about its application in the study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the PhysioNet QT Database. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **PhysioNet QT Database**:
  > P. Laguna, R. Mark, A. Goldberg, and G. Moody. *A database for evaluation of algorithms for measurement of QT and other waveform intervals in the ECG*. In Computers in Cardiology 1997. IEEE, 1997. Available: https://doi.org/10.1109/cic.1997.648140

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **PhysioNet QT Database**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed GP filter, consisting of 15 minutes of 2-lead ECGs sampled at 250 Hz.

With this information, I can now prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
