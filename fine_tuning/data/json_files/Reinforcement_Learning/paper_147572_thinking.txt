To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Advantage Actor-Critic Model for Task-Completion Dialogue Policy Learning" by Baolin Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a method for dialogue policy learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they used a dataset of raw conversational data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, annotated by domain experts. This suggests that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors describe the dataset as a "single-domain movie-ticket booking dataset" containing 11 dialogue acts and 29 slots, with a total of 280 labeled dialogues. However, they do not provide a formal name for the dataset or a citation.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might have introduced or used this dataset. The authors reference a paper by Li et al. (2016) that discusses a user simulator for task-completion dialogues, which may be related to the dataset they used. The citation for this paper is:

- Xiujun Li, Zachary C Lipton, Bhuwan Dhingra, Lihong Li, Jianfeng Gao, and Yun-Nung Chen. *A user simulator for task-completion dialogues*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.05688, 2016.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the movie-ticket booking dataset, I will note that it is derived from the work of Li et al. (2016) and may be referenced as such.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Movie-Ticket Booking Dataset**: This dataset consists of raw conversational data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, annotated by domain experts. It includes 11 dialogue acts and 29 slots, with a total of 280 labeled dialogues.

The citation for the related work is:
- Xiujun Li, Zachary C Lipton, Bhuwan Dhingra, Lihong Li, Jianfeng Gao, and Yun-Nung Chen. *A user simulator for task-completion dialogues*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.05688, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
