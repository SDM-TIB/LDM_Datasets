To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoOD: Automated Outlier Detection via Curiosity-guided Search and Self-imitation Learning" by Yuening Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experimental results are demonstrated on "various real-world benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **MNIST**: An image dataset consisting of handwritten digits, with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST but containing fashion products, also with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 different classes.
4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet containing 10,000 test images from 200 different classes.
5. **MVTec-AD**: A benchmark dataset for industrial inspection, containing over 5,000 high-resolution images divided into 15 categories.
6. **CAT**: A dataset that includes 10,000 cat images.
7. **Gaussian Noise**: A synthetic dataset consisting of 1,000 random 2D images with pixel values sampled from a Gaussian distribution.
8. **Uniform Noise**: Another synthetic dataset with 1,000 images, where pixel values are sampled from a uniform distribution.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

- **Fashion-MNIST**:

- **CAT**: 
  > W. Zhang, J. Sun, and X. Tang. "Cat dataset." https://archive.org/details/CAT_DATASET, 2009.

- **Gaussian Noise**: No specific citation is provided as it is a synthetic dataset created for the experiments.

- **Uniform Noise**: Similar to Gaussian Noise, no specific citation is provided.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
