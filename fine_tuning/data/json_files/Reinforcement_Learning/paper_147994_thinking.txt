To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MQLV: Optimal Policy of Money Management in Retail Banking with Q-Learning" by Jeremy Charlier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of synthetic datasets generated from the Vasicek model, which indicates that there are datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. They explicitly state that they generated three different synthetic datasets using the Vasicek model, which are crucial for their experiments. The details provided include:

1. **Dataset 1**: Contains 20,000 Monte Carlo paths.
2. **Dataset 2**: Contains 30,000 Monte Carlo paths.
3. **Dataset 3**: Contains 40,000 Monte Carlo paths.

The authors emphasize that these datasets are generated to avoid bias and to assess the influence of sampling size on the results. They also mention that the datasets cannot be released publicly due to privacy and confidentiality issues, but they provide a description of how these datasets were created.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are synthetic and generated from the Vasicek model, there may not be specific citations for them. Instead, I will note the reference to the Vasicek model itself, which is crucial for understanding the generation of the datasets.

The citation for the Vasicek model is:
> Vasicek, O. (1977). "An equilibrium characterization of the term structure." *Journal of Financial Economics*, 5(2), 177â€“188.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their descriptions and the relevant citations, into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
