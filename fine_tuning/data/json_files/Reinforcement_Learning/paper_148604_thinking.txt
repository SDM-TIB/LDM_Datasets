To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Queueing Network Controls via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by J. G. Dai and Mark Gluzman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the PPO algorithm on a parallel-server system and multiclass queueing networks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these systems.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were used in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, I find that the authors refer to a specific dataset related to the **N-model network** and the **criss-cross network**. They describe the parameters and configurations used for these networks, which may imply the use of synthetic datasets generated based on these models.

I will also check the **references section** to see if the authors cite any external datasets or previous works that provide datasets relevant to their study. This could include datasets used in prior research that the authors built upon.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper refers to a dataset from a previous study, I will include the citation for that study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references for any cited datasets.
4. Document the names, descriptions, and full citations of the datasets identified.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of dataset information from the paper.
