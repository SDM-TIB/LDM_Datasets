To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Framework for Policy Mirror Descent with General Parametrization and Linear Convergence" by Carlo Alfano, Rui Yuan, and Patrick Rebeschini, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves. I will look for these citations in the **references section** of the paper, where the authors typically provide complete bibliographic details.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **OpenAI Gym** dataset, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily accessed later.

By following these steps, I will systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.
