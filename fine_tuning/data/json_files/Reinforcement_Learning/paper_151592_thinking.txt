To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UniFIDES: Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers" by Milad Saadat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of UniFIDES in solving various integro-differential equations, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention several test cases, including integer-order and fractional problems, but I need to determine if these problems are based on existing datasets or if they are synthetic data generated for the purpose of the study.

In the **results section**, the authors present various cases (e.g., Case 1, Case 2, etc.) and provide equations and solutions, but they do not explicitly reference any external datasets. Instead, they seem to be using mathematical formulations and numerical methods to generate their results. 

I will also check the **methods section** to see if there are any references to datasets used for training or validation. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on the development of their method and the mathematical formulations rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. While the references include various studies related to integro-differential equations, they do not seem to point to specific datasets that were used in this research.

Since the paper does not mention any specific datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that this research primarily relies on theoretical formulations and numerical simulations rather than external datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations for this paper.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Analyzing the results and methods sections for any mention of datasets.
3. Checking the references for potential dataset citations.
4. Concluding that no external datasets were utilized in this research.

As a result, I will not create any dataset entries since none were identified in the paper.
