To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Language Model-based Search" by Siddhant Bhambri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **BabyAI environment suite** for their experiments. I will note that this suite consists of various environments, including **DoorKey**, **Empty-Random**, and **LavaGap**. Each of these environments serves as a dataset for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. The BabyAI environment suite is referenced in the paper, and I will look for the original source or citation for this suite in the **References section**.

The citation for the BabyAI environment suite is:
> Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Salem Lahlou, Lucas Willems, Chitwan Saharia, Thien Huu Nguyen, and Yoshua Bengio. *BabyAI: A platform to study the sample efficiency of grounded language learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.08272, 2018.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset extracted from the paper.
