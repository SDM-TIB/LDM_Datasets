To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCaRL - A Synthetic Multi-Modal Dataset for Autonomous Driving" by Avinash Nittur Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the SCaRL dataset as a novel multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving, which indicates that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **generation of SCaRL Dataset** sections to gather detailed information about the SCaRL dataset itself. The authors describe SCaRL as a synthetic dataset that includes synchronized data from various sensors, including RGB cameras, lidar, and radar. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition, such as the types of data collected and the scenarios simulated.

In the **summary and future work** section, the authors reiterate the significance of the SCaRL dataset and its intended applications, confirming that SCaRL is the primary dataset discussed throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SCaRL dataset. However, since SCaRL is a newly introduced dataset in this paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced and described in this paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Avinash Nittur Ramesh, Aitor Correas-Serrano, María González-Huici. *SCaRL - A Synthetic Multi-Modal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. Fraunhofer FHR, Germany.

Since SCaRL is the only dataset mentioned in this paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's details and its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
