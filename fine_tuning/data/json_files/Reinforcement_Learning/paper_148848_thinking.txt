To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Augmented Index Policy for Optimal Service Placement at the Network Edge" by Guojun Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses related work, which may include datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their sources and relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
