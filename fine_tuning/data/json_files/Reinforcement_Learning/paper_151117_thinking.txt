To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Investigation of Value-Based Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning for Stochastic Environments" by Kewen Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) but do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section** where they describe the experimental setup.

In **section 3 (Experimental methodology)**, the authors mention using the **Space Traders MOMDP** as a benchmark for their experiments. This indicates that the Space Traders environment is a dataset or simulation used for their evaluations.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experimental results** section. Here, they describe various approaches tested, but they primarily focus on the performance of algorithms rather than additional datasets. However, they do provide details about the **Space Traders environment**, which includes transition probabilities and reward structures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Space Traders dataset. The authors reference the original work that introduced the Space Traders environment, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the Space Traders environment is:
> Ding, K. (2022). Addressing the issue of stochastic environments and local decision-making in multi-objective reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:221108669.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the Space Traders MOMDP.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the Space Traders environment as required. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and accurately documented.
