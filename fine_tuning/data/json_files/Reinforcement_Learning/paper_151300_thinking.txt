To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Tuning Parameter Selection for High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressions" by Anders Bredahl Kock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional mentions of datasets, particularly if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets or provide comparisons.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "US Macroeconomic Data," I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> McCracken, M. W., & Ng, S. (2016). FRED-MD: A Monthly Database for Macroeconomic Research. *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, 34(4), 574-589.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
