To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Beamforming in IRS-assisted Wireless Communications" by Jiaye Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets used in their research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will check there as well to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on the datasets, which may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset" in their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references that provides the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
