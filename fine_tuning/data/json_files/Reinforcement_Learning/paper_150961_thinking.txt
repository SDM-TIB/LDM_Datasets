To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dropout Strategy in Reinforcement Learning: Limiting the Surrogate Objective Variance in Policy Optimization Methods" by Zhengpeng Xie, Changdong Yu, and Weizheng Qiao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses comparative experiments in the **Atari 2600 environment**, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or a benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments in the **Atari 2600 environment**, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. I will confirm if they refer to any specific games or datasets within this environment.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention various games such as **Breakout, MsPacman, CrazyClimber, DemonAttack, Enduro, Gravitar, Kangaroo, and SpaceInvaders**. These games are part of the Atari 2600 environment and serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the Atari 2600 environment or the specific games mentioned. The Atari 2600 environment is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The citation for the Atari 2600 environment is:
> Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. “Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning.” arxiv preprint arxiv:1312.5602 (2013).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Atari 2600 Environment**: This includes various games used for testing reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically the games mentioned in the experiments.

I will ensure to format the dataset entries correctly and include the full citation for the Atari 2600 environment. After compiling the dataset entries, I will prepare them for structured output as required.
