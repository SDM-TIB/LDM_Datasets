To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Text Generation for Authorship Anonymization" by Haohan Bo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two datasets: the **real-life peer reviews dataset** and the **Yelp review dataset**. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Yelp Review Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews and tips from the top 100 reviewers on Yelp, containing 76,241 reviews and 200,940 sentences from 100 authors.

2. **Academic Review Dataset**: This dataset includes public reviews from NeurIPS (2013-2018) and ICLR (2017), totaling 17,719 reviews and 268,253 sentences, with authorship unknown.

Both datasets are crucial for understanding the evaluation of the proposed model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets in the text, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For the **Yelp Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge.

- For the **Academic Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dongyeop Kang, Waleed Ammar, Bhavana Dalvi, Madeleine van Zuylen, Sebastian Kohlmeier, Ed- uard Hovy, and Roy Schwartz. *A dataset of peer reviews (peerread): Collection, insights and NLP applications*. In Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Yelp Review Dataset**: A dataset containing reviews and tips from the top 100 reviewers on Yelp, with a total of 76,241 reviews and 200,940 sentences from 100 authors.

2. **Academic Review Dataset**: A dataset comprising public reviews from NeurIPS (2013-2018) and ICLR (2017), with 17,719 reviews and 268,253 sentences, where authorship is unknown.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
