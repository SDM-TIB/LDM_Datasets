To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning by In-Network Experience Sampling" by Masaki Furukawa and Hiroki Matsutani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of communication performance in distributed reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background and implementation sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In the background section, the authors mention "Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay (Ape-X)" as a baseline architecture, but again, no specific datasets are named.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** environment, specifically the **Atari's Breakout game**, as a reinforcement learning task. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the OpenAI Gym environment, which is a well-known framework for reinforcement learning tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > OpenAI Gym. https://gym.openai.com.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will summarize my findings:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is the primary dataset/environment used in the experiments, specifically for the Atari's Breakout game.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the full citation for the OpenAI Gym. This will ensure that the information is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
