To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Counterfactual Explanations for Neural Networks With Probabilistic Guarantees" by Faisal Hamman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they utilized:

1. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains anonymized information about home equity line of credit applications made by homeowners in the US. It consists of 10,459 rows and 40 features, normalized to be between zero and one.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,000 entries representing individuals who have taken credit from a bank, characterized by 20 categorical features. The data is one-hot encoded and normalized to fall between 0 and 1.

3. **Cardiotocography (CTG) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,126 fetal cardiotocograms categorized into three categories: healthy, suspect, and pathological. It has been transformed into a binary classification task and normalized.

4. **Adult Dataset**: Based on 1994 U.S. census data, this dataset is used to predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 per year. It consists of approximately 48,842 instances, split into training and test sets.

5. **Taiwanese Credit Dataset**: This dataset contains 30,000 instances with 24 features, indicating individuals' financial data, with a binary response indicating creditworthiness. The data is normalized and partitioned into training and test sets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **HELOC Dataset**: 
  > FICO. *FICO XML Challenge*. Available at: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge, 2018.

- **German Credit Dataset**: 
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. UCI machine learning repository, 2017. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

  > Yeh, I.-C. and hui Lien, C. *The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients*. Expert Systems with Applications, 36(2):2473â€“2480, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
