To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Deep Q-Learning Based Handover in Wireless Networks with Dual Connectivity" by Pedro Enrique Iturria-Rivera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced or described. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for improving handover latency in dual connectivity scenarios, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to look for any datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention simulation results, but they do not specify any real-world datasets. Instead, they describe the simulation settings and parameters used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The authors refer to various technical reports and papers related to dual connectivity and reinforcement learning, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Since the paper primarily focuses on simulation results rather than empirical data from established datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract in the traditional sense. However, I will note the relevant references that provide context for the methodologies used in the simulations.

The references that might be relevant for understanding the context of the experiments include:

1. **3GPP TR 36.842**: "Study on small cell enhancements for E-UTRA and E-UTRAN, v12.0.0," Tech. Rep., 2013.
2. **3GPP TS 37.340**: "Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), LTE, 5G, NR, Multi-connectivity, Overall description, Stage-2," Tech. Rep., 2019.
3. **M. Polese et al.**: "Improved Handover Through Dual Connectivity in 5G mmWave Mobile Networks," IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun., vol. 35, no. 9, pp. 2069â€“2084, 2017.

Since there are no datasets to extract, I will summarize my findings and document the relevant references for future reference or for anyone interested in the methodologies discussed in the paper.
