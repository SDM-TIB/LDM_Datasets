To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R2D2" by Yiwei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any references to specific datasets or datasets used in prior works that are relevant to their study.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in subsection III (Data Simulation), the authors describe the generation of their dataset. They mention using the **FastMRI single-coil knee dataset** for their experiments. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **experimental results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **FastMRI single-coil knee dataset**, the citation is:
> Jure Zbontar, Florian Knoll, Anuroop Sriram, Tullie Murrell, Zhengnan Huang, Matthew J Muckley, Aaron Defazio, Ruben Stern, Patricia Johnson, Mary Bruno, et al. *FastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset using the required format.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and full citation, which is crucial for proper documentation and future reference. This structured approach will help me extract and present the dataset information clearly and effectively.
