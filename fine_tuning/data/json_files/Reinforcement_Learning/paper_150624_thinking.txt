To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Difference Learning with Experience Replay" by Han-Dong Lim and Donghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment** for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or citations in the paper.
