To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with Quantum Variational Circuits" by Owen Lockwood and Mei Si, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using two OpenAI Gym environments: **CartPole** and **Blackjack**. This suggests that these environments are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to confirm the use of these environments and gather more details. In section 5, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **CartPole** and **Blackjack**, describing them as benchmarks for reinforcement learning algorithms. This confirms that these environments are indeed the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. Since both CartPole and Blackjack are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will refer to the citation for the OpenAI Gym itself:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G.; Cheung, V.; Pettersson, L.; Schneider, J.; Schulman, J.; Tang, J.; and Zaremba, W. 2016. OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since CartPole and Blackjack are specific environments within the OpenAI Gym, they do not have separate citations but are included under the OpenAI Gym reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **CartPole**: An environment used for reinforcement learning tasks, where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.
2. **Blackjack**: A casino game environment used for reinforcement learning, where the objective is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented along with its citation.
