To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization Smoothed Algorithm" by Wangshu Zhu and Andre Rosendo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention testing their algorithm on various continuous control tasks implemented on OpenAI Gym, specifically simulated by MuJoCo. This indicates that the datasets used are likely the environments provided by OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets or environments in the **experimental setup** and **comparison with other methods** sections. The authors refer to five Mujoco environments: **Humanoid-v2, Ant-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Swimmer-v2, and Reacher-v2**. These environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The paper cites the following relevant references:

1. For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012, October). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries. The datasets identified are the environments from OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo used in the experiments.

Finally, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
