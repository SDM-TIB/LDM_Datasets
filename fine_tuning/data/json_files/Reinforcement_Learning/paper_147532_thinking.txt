To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoT: Cooperative Training for Generative Modeling of Discrete Data" by Sidi Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any benchmarks or specific datasets that the authors reference. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using a dataset for their experiments, specifically the **EMNLP 2017 WMT News Section** for text generation tasks. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMNLP 2017 WMT News Section dataset. If the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will look for any relevant papers or sources that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the EMNLP 2017 WMT News Section is as follows:
> EMNLP 2017 WMT News Section. *WMT 2017: Conference on Machine Translation*. Available at: [http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html](http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
