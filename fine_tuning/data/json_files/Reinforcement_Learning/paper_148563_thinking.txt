To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developmental Reinforcement Learning of Control Policy of a Quadcopter UAV with Thrust Vectoring Rotors" by Aditya M. Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may specify the datasets used for training or evaluation.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to simulation environments or datasets used for training the quadcopter. The authors mention using **Mujoco Physics** and **OpenAI Gym** for their simulations, which indicates that they might have created a custom dataset or environment for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or simulation environment, I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:

- For the **Mujoco Physics** environment, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026â€“5033). IEEE.

- For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
