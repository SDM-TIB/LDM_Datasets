To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effects of Sparse Rewards of Different Magnitudes in the Speed of Learning of Model-Based Actor Critic Methods" by Juan Vargas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference prior works that used specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include specific environments or datasets used for training and testing. In this paper, the authors mention using the **FetchSlide environment**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets or environments used in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of their methods in relation to the training and testing phases, which may provide insights into the datasets involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference several works, including those related to the **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)** and the **FetchSlide environment**. 

For the **FetchSlide environment**, the citation is:
> Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., & Zaremba, W. (2018). Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research. CoRR, abs/1802.09464.

For **Hindsight Experience Replay**, the citation is:
> Andrychowicz, M., Wolski, F., Ray, A., Schneider, J., Fong, R., Welinder, P., McGrew, B., Tobin, J., Abbeel, P., & Zaremba, W. (2017). Hindsight experience replay. CoRR, abs/1707.01495.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
