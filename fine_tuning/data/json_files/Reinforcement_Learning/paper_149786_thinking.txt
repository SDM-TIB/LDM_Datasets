To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness via Explanation Quality: Evaluating Disparities in the Quality of Post hoc Explanations" by Jessica Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an empirical analysis using three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their analysis. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for credit scoring tasks and is known for its binary classification of credit risk.
2. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset is utilized to predict student performance based on various features related to their educational background and demographic information.
3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for assessing recidivism risk and has been widely discussed in the context of fairness in machine learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **German Credit Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

- **Student Performance Dataset**:
  > Cortez, P., & Silva, A. (2008). Using Data Mining to Predict Secondary School Student Performance. Proceedings of 5th FUture BUsiness TEChnology Conference.

- **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine Bias. ProPublica. https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources, which is essential for any subsequent analysis or reporting.
