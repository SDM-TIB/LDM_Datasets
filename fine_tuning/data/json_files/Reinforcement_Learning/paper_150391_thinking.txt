To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Likelihood Annealing: Fast Calibrated Uncertainty for Regression" by Uddeshya Upadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical analysis on "five vastly diverse tasks," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they conducted experiments on five datasets, which are categorized into small-scale and large-scale problems. 

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **Lorenz Attractor**: This dataset is used for chaotic system regression, generated from the Lorenz equations with added Gaussian noise. 

2. **Atom3D**: This dataset is aimed at predicting physical properties of molecules using 3D atomistic representations. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Townshend, R. J. L., et al. *Atom3D: Tasks on molecules in three dimensions*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 1), 2021.

3. **Boston Housing**: This dataset is used for predicting house prices based on various attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Harrison Jr, D. & Rubinfeld, D. L. *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1): 81-102, 1978.

4. **DIV2K**: This dataset is utilized for super-resolution tasks, specifically for mapping low-resolution images to high-resolution images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Timofte, R., et al. *NTIRE 2018 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, June 2018.

5. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset is used for medical image translation tasks, specifically translating T1 MRI to T2 MRI images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Robinson, E. C., et al. *Identifying population differences in whole-brain structural networks: a machine learning approach*. NeuroImage, 50(3): 910-919, 2010.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to verify the citations in the **References section** of the paper to confirm their accuracy and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
