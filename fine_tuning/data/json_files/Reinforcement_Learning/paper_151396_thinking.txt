To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Privacy Guard: Robust Traceable Adversarial Watermarking against Face Recognition" by Yunming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their proposed method. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on two commonly used large face image datasets: **LFW** and **CelebA**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional information regarding how these datasets were processed or utilized in the experiments. This may include preprocessing steps or specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

1. For **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**, the citation is:
   > G. B. Huang, M. Mattar, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In Workshop on faces in 'Real-Life' Images: detection, alignment, and recognition, 2008.

2. For **CelebA**, the citation is:
   > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
