To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributive Dynamic Spectrum Access through Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Reservoir Computing Based Approach" by Hao-Hsuan Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning for dynamic spectrum access, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or provide insights into their structure and usage. If the authors conducted experiments using specific datasets, they should be clearly identified here.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper mentions any datasets but does not provide full citations, I will look for the original sources of those datasets in the references. This may involve searching for the datasets online or checking other papers that have cited them.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and correctly attributed to the original sources.
