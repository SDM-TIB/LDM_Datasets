To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Network Based Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Binary Action Agents" by Abdul Mueed Hafiz and Ghulam Mohiuddin Bhat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their proposed approach on three tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **implementation and experimentation section** (Section 3) closely, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets or environments used for the experiments. In this section, the authors mention three specific environments:

1. **CartPole-v1**: An OpenAI Gym environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The authors describe the actions and rewards associated with this environment.

2. **LunarLander-v2**: Another OpenAI Gym environment where the task is to land a spacecraft on a designated pad. The authors provide details about the actions and rewards in this environment as well.

3. **Maze Traversal**: A customized environment designed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with specific rules for navigating a maze. The authors describe the structure of the maze and the rewards associated with reaching the target cell.

After identifying these environments, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. Since the environments are standard benchmarks from OpenAI Gym, I will reference the official documentation for these environments:

- For **CartPole-v1**, the citation is:
  > Barto AG, Sutton RS, Anderson CW (1983) Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics SMC-13 (5):834-846. doi:10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313077

- For **LunarLander-v2**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Maze Traversal**, since it is a customized environment, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as a custom implementation based on the authors' design.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for the standard environments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
