To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARSM: Augment-REINFORCE-Swap-Merge Estimator for Gradient Backpropagation Through Categorical Variables" by Mingzhang Yin, Yuguang Yue, and Mingyuan Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments"** or **"Datasets"**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, which typically includes the datasets used for validation and testing.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any standard datasets, I will note them down. For instance, if they mention using datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10, I will ensure to capture those details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using the MNIST dataset, I would find the citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through accurate citations.
