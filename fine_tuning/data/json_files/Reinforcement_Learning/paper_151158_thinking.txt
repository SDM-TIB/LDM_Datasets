To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Alignment: A Closed-form Solution for Aligning Human Preferences without Tuning and Feedback" by Songyang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on both general and personalized preference datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention a new dataset focused on personalized preferences, which features 536 samples across five preference domains. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being introduced.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the **Anthropic-RLHF-HH dataset**, which is a large-scale collection of pair-level human preferences in AI responses. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Personalized Preference Dataset**: This dataset includes 536 samples spanning five preference domains, designed to model a diverse range of user needs. The authors constructed this dataset to evaluate the model's capacity for capturing personalized user intentions.

2. **Anthropic-RLHF-HH Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 161K training samples of pair-level human preferences in AI responses. It is used for comparison with the proposed method.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references:

- For the **Anthropic-RLHF-HH dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anthropic. *Anthropic-RLHF-HH Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf.

- The **Personalized Preference Dataset** does not have a specific citation listed in the references, but it is described in detail within the paper itself.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details accurately.
