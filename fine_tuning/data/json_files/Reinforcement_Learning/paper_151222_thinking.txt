To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entropy-Regularized Token-Level Policy Optimization for Large Language Models" by Muning Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a simulated environment for data science code generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that outlines the datasets, including their names, features, samples, and classes.

Upon reviewing the text, I find a table (Table 1) that lists several datasets used for experiments, including:

1. **Pharyngitis Dataset**: 
   - Features: 19
   - Samples: 512
   - Classes: 2

2. **Kidney Stone Dataset**: 
   - Features: 7
   - Samples: 414
   - Classes: 2

3. **Health Insurance Dataset**: 
   - Features: 13
   - Samples: 2000
   - Classes: 2

4. **Spaceship Titanic Dataset**: 
   - Features: 13
   - Samples: 2000
   - Classes: 3

5. **Airlines Dataset**: 
   - Features: 7
   - Samples: 2000
   - Classes: 2

6. **Balance Scale Dataset**: 
   - Features: 4
   - Samples: 625
   - Classes: 3

7. **Breast-W Dataset**: 
   - Features: 9
   - Samples: 699
   - Classes: 2

8. **CMC Dataset**: 
   - Features: 9
   - Samples: 1473
   - Classes: 3

9. **Credit-G Dataset**: 
   - Features: 20
   - Samples: 1000
   - Classes: 2

10. **Diabetes Dataset**: 
    - Features: 8
    - Samples: 768
    - Classes: 2

11. **Eucalyptus Dataset**: 
    - Features: 19
    - Samples: 736
    - Classes: 5

12. **Jungle Chess Dataset**: 
    - Features: 6
    - Samples: 2000
    - Classes: 2

13. **PC1 Dataset**: 
    - Features: 10
    - Samples: 1109
    - Classes: 2

14. **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: 
    - Features: 9
    - Samples: 958
    - Classes: 2

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that some datasets are sourced from Kaggle and OpenML, which will help in locating their citations.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **Pharyngitis Dataset**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
