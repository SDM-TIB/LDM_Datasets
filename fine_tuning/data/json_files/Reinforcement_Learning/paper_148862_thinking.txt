To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Perturbation-based Saliency Maps for Explaining Atari Agents" by Tobias Huber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate saliency map approaches on **four different Atari 2600 games**, which suggests that these games may serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **Atari Learning Environment** as the test-bed for their evaluation. They state that four DRL agents were trained on the games **MsPacman, Space Invaders, Frostbite, and Breakout**. This confirms that these games are indeed the datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Atari Learning Environment is a well-known framework, and the games mentioned are part of this environment. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:

- **Atari Learning Environment**:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari Learning Environment, which encompasses the games used in the experiments.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Atari Learning Environment** (which includes the games MsPacman, Space Invaders, Frostbite, and Breakout):
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
