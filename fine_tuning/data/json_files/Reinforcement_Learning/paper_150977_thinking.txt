To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithm enhanced by Deep Reinforcement Learning in parent selection mechanism and mutation: Minimizing makespan in permutation flow shop scheduling problems" by M. Irmouli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the problem being addressed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the flow shop scheduling problem (FSP) and the challenges associated with it. They mention various algorithms and approaches but do not specify datasets yet. 

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for testing the proposed method. In this paper, the authors mention that they implemented their hybrid algorithm on "several instances of taillard benchmarks," specifically citing "instances 1 and 7" from the Taillard benchmarks. This indicates that the Taillard benchmark datasets are used for evaluation.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the Taillard benchmarks is:

- For the **Taillard benchmarks**, the citation is:
  > Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. *Journal of Scheduling*, 1(2), 111-117. DOI: 10.1007/BF00120289.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Taillard Benchmarks**: The paper utilizes instances from the Taillard benchmarks for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes ensuring that the full citation is accurately represented for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
