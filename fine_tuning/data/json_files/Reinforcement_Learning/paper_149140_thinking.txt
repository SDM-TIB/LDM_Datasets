To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning by Watching" by Jimuyang Zhang and Eshed Ohn-Bar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework and mentions the CARLA benchmark, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this framework.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the **CARLA** and **NoCrash** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific details about these datasets. The authors mention using the **CARLA simulator** for generating diverse multi-agent driving scenes and evaluating their framework. They also refer to the **NoCrash benchmark**, which employs various traffic density conditions.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
   > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In CoRL, 2017.

2. **NoCrash Benchmark**: The citation for the NoCrash benchmark is:
   > Felipe Codevilla, Eder Santana, Antonio M LÃ³pez, and Adrien Gaidon. *Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving*. In ICCV, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
