To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QoS-SLA-Aware Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Request Offloading in Integrated Edge-Cloud Computing in Internet of Vehicles" by Leila Ismail et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Vehicle-Crowd Interaction (VCI) – DUT dataset** for vehicles’ positioning. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the VCI dataset as follows:

- For the **Vehicle-Crowd Interaction (VCI) – DUT dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Yang, L. Li, K. Redmill, and Ü. Özgüner, “Top-view trajectories: A pedestrian dataset of vehicle-crowd interaction from controlled experiments and crowded campus,” in 2019 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2019, pp. 899–904.

Additionally, the paper mentions using characteristics from three different ITS applications, but it does not specify additional datasets for these applications. Therefore, I will focus on the VCI dataset as the primary dataset extracted from this paper.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section for any identified datasets.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
