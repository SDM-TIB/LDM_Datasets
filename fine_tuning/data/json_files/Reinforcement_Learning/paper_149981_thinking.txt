To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Image Synthesis for Discovery of Personalized Predictive Image Markers" by Amar Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "large-scale, multi-scanner, multi-center multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset." This suggests that a specific dataset is being used, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Dataset and Implementation Details)**, where the authors provide more specific information about the dataset. Here, they mention that they leverage a "large, proprietary, longitudinal RRMS clinical trial MRI dataset, with a total of 815 subjects." However, the dataset is described as proprietary, which means it may not have a publicly available citation.

I will also look for any references to other datasets that may be used in the experiments or mentioned in the context of their methodology. The authors refer to established imaging markers and previous studies, but they do not explicitly mention additional datasets beyond the proprietary one.

Since the dataset is proprietary, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Proprietary RRMS Clinical Trial MRI Dataset**: This dataset is used for the experiments and consists of 815 subjects. It is a longitudinal dataset with MRI scans taken at baseline and follow-up.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will focus on documenting the proprietary dataset as follows:

- For the **Proprietary RRMS Clinical Trial MRI Dataset**, I will note:
  > Amar Kumar, Anjun Hu, Brennan Nichyporuk, Jean-Pierre R. Falet, Douglas L. Arnold, Sotirios Tsaftaris, and Tal Arbel. *Counterfactual Image Synthesis for Discovery of Personalized Predictive Image Markers*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that the citation is clear and complete for future reference.
