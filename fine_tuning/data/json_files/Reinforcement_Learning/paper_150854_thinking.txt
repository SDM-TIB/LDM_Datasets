To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for Lighting Systems: Application to Aircraft Cabin" by Kritika Vashishtha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or studies that utilized datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors present any data derived from specific datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on the datasets used in their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Daily Glare Index" or any specific user study data, I will ensure to find the original source or citation for that dataset.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining academic integrity through proper citation.
