To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization Issues in KL-Constrained Approximate Policy Iteration" by Nevena LaziÄ‡ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it can indicate the types of experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which appears to be section 6 in this paper) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the environments they tested their algorithms on. 

In the experiments section, the authors mention several environments from the **DeepMind Control Suite** and provide a brief description of each:

1. **cartpole:balance**: This environment involves balancing an unactuated pole by applying forces to a cart. The reward function is based on the position of the pole and cart.

2. **cartpole:swingup**: Similar to the previous environment, but the pole starts pointing down, and the goal is to swing it up and balance it.

3. **ball in cup:catch**: In this environment, an actuated planar receptacle catches a ball. The reward is given if the ball is in the cup.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are part of the DeepMind Control Suite, I will look for the citation for that suite.

The citation for the DeepMind Control Suite is:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
