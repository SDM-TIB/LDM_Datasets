To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "ScreenerNet: Learning Self-Paced Curriculum for Deep Neural Networks" by Tae-Hoon Kim and Jonghyun Choi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using three vision datasets: **Pascal VOC 2012, CIFAR10, and MNIST**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 5,717 images for training and 5,823 images for validation. It is a well-known benchmark in object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 32x32 pixels. It is widely used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

3. **MNIST**: This dataset includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each sized 28x28 pixels. It is a classic dataset for image classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their visual recognition tasks, which further validates their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html, 2012.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2012.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. Lecun and C. Cortes. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. NYU, 1992.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
