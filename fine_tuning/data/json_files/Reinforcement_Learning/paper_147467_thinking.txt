To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Organizing Experience: A Deeper Look at Replay Mechanisms for Sample-based Planning in Continuous State Domains" by Yangchen Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets" or "Experiments" section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments they used for testing their methods. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of environments or datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention two specific environments: **Continuous Gridworld** and **River Swim**. I will extract the relevant details about these environments, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments.

1. **Continuous Gridworld**: This environment is described as a continuous variant of a gridworld problem, where the state space consists of points in a 2D space, and the agent can move with some probability of success. The paper mentions that the agent receives a reward for reaching the goal area.

2. **River Swim**: This environment is a modified version of a tabular River Swim domain, where the state space is continuous. The agent's goal is to swim upstream, and it receives rewards based on its position in the river.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any foundational papers or datasets that are referenced. However, in this case, the environments are described in detail within the paper itself, and they do not appear to have separate citations.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as well as any relevant details about the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Yangchen Pan, Muhammad Zaheer, Adam White, Andrew Patterson, Martha White. *Organizing Experience: A Deeper Look at Replay Mechanisms for Sample-based Planning in Continuous State Domains*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2023.

With this information gathered, I will prepare the dataset entries for the Continuous Gridworld and River Swim environments, ensuring that I document their characteristics and relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
