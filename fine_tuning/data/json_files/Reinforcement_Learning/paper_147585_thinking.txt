To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Tower Line Wars" by Per-Arne Andersen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a game environment for reinforcement learning, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Deep Line Wars)**, which describes the game environment created by the authors. This section may provide insights into the data used for training the reinforcement learning models. However, it primarily focuses on the game mechanics and does not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will then check **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the experiments conducted with various deep learning algorithms. They mention testing algorithms in the Deep Line Wars environment but do not specify any external datasets used for training or evaluation. Instead, they focus on the performance of their proposed algorithms within the game environment.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the research. The references primarily consist of foundational papers on reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created a custom game environment (Deep Line Wars) specifically designed for testing their reinforcement learning algorithms.

In conclusion, I will document that no external datasets were mentioned in the paper, and the focus was on the custom game environment developed by the authors. Therefore, there are no full citations for datasets to provide.

I will summarize my findings clearly, noting the absence of datasets and emphasizing the unique contribution of the paper in creating a new game environment for reinforcement learning research.
