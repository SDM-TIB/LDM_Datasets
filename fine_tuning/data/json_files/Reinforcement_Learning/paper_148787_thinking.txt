To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Driving-Policy Adaptive Safeguard for Autonomous Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning" by Zhong Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed safeguard using a simulation platform, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to traffic simulations or driving data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. The paper mentions a "simulation platform" and "naturalistic driving data," which indicates that there are datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **simulation platform section**, the authors describe the traffic simulation environment and mention that the performance metrics are calibrated using "naturalistic driving data." This suggests that there is a dataset that captures real-world driving behaviors, which is crucial for validating the proposed methods.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any specific datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss various simulation experiments and their outcomes, but I need to ensure that I capture the exact names and details of the datasets used.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references several studies and datasets that may be relevant to the work presented. I will look for citations that specifically mention datasets related to traffic simulations or naturalistic driving data.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any relevant details that were mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
