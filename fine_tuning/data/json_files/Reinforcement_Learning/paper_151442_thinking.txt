To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization with Adaptive Exploration" by Andrei Lixandru, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, but it does not mention any specific datasets. The introduction discusses the dual control problem in reinforcement learning but does not explicitly reference datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly the **experiments** subsection. Here, the author mentions that the experiments are conducted in the **Gymnasium CartPole-v1 environment**. This indicates that the dataset used for training the reinforcement learning agent is the CartPole environment, which is part of the Gymnasium toolkit.

In the **results** section, the author presents performance metrics for the different algorithms tested, but again, there is no mention of additional datasets. The focus remains on the performance of the proposed algorithm in the specified environment.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Gymnasium toolkit, which is essential for proper attribution. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Gymnasium**:
  > Mark Towers, Jordan K. Terry, Ariel Kwiatkowski, John U. Balis, Gianluca de Cola, Tristan Deleu, Manuel Goulão, Andreas Kallinteris, Arjun KG, Markus Krimmel, Rodrigo Perez-Vicente, Andrea Pierré, Sander Schulhoff, Jun Jet Tai, Andrew Tan Jin Shen, and Omar G. Younis. *Gymnasium*, March 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Gymnasium dataset.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the Gymnasium CartPole-v1 environment, and I will ensure to document it accurately with its citation.
