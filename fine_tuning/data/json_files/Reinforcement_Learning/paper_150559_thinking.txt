To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Multi-objective Path Planning on the Off-road Terrain Environment for Ground Vehicles" by Shuqiao Huang, Xiru Wu, and Guoming Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **2.5D map** for their simulations. I will need to determine if this map is a publicly available dataset or if it is a custom dataset created by the authors. If it is custom, I will note that down as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. This is crucial for providing full citations. If the authors reference existing datasets, I will extract the full citation details from the references.

For example, if they reference a specific terrain dataset or simulation environment, I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication in the citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
