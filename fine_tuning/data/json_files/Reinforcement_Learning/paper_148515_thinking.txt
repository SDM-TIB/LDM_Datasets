To extract datasets from the research paper titled "First Steps Towards a Runtime Analysis When Starting With a Good Solution" by Max Buzdalov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may reference specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation of the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions of each dataset. This section is crucial as it usually provides the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their sources, the number of samples, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "OneMax benchmark," I will look for its original citation, which might be something like:
> Benjamin Doerr, Carola Doerr, and Franziska Ebel. *From black-box complexity to designing new genetic algorithms*. Theoretical Computer Science, 567:87â€“104, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
