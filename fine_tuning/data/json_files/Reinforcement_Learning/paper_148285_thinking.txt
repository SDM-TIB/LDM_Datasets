To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Hindsight Experience Replay," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **OpenAI Robotic manipulation tasks**, which suggests that there are specific datasets or environments used for these evaluations.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. They mention two specific environments:

1. **Fetch environments**: These are based on a 7-DoF Fetch robotic arm, which includes tasks like moving, sliding, or placing objects to desired positions. The tasks are described as having sparse binary rewards.

2. **Hand environments**: These involve the Shadow Dexterous Hand, which has 24 degrees of freedom and is used for more complex manipulation tasks. The actions and observations are detailed, indicating the complexity of the tasks involved.

In this section, the authors do not provide formal dataset names but refer to the environments used for training and evaluation. I will need to find the original sources or references for these environments to provide proper citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The relevant references are:

- For the **OpenAI Robotics environment**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Plappert, Marcin Andrychowicz, Alex Ray, Bob McGrew, Bowen Baker, Glenn Powell, Jonas Schneider, Josh Tobin, Maciek Chociej, Peter Welinder, et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

This citation provides the necessary information about the environments used in the experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment as required. This will ensure that the extracted information is complete and properly referenced for future use.
