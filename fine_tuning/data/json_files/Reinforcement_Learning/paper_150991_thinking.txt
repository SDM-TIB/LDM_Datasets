To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Network Optimization with Mixture Datasets" by Kun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of offline reinforcement learning (RL) for wireless radio resource management (RRM) and mentions the evaluation of several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. This suggests that datasets are involved, particularly those related to the RRM problem.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the **section V (Offline RL)**, the authors describe how they collect offline datasets from existing behavior policies (BPs) used for training. They mention that they deployed four rule-based policies and two online RL policies as BPs, which implies that datasets were generated from these policies.

The paper states that they gathered one million trajectories for their offline dataset using the best online RL policy as a BP. This indicates a specific dataset used for their experiments. I will note this dataset and its context.

In **section VI (Offline RL with Mixture Datasets)**, the authors discuss the concept of combining datasets from multiple behavior policies to enhance offline RL performance. They mention two combinations of BPs used for their experiments: "Mixed-RL" and "Mixed-ITLinQ." However, they do not provide specific names for the datasets themselves, but rather describe the policies used to generate them.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The references include citations for the algorithms and methods mentioned, but they do not provide specific dataset citations. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the behavior policies mentioned:

1. **High-quality dataset**: Collected from the best online RL policy, which is not explicitly named in the paper but is referenced as having one million trajectories.

2. **Low-quality datasets**: Generated from four rule-based policies (Random, Greedy, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), and ITLinQ) and two online RL policies (one trained for 125 epochs and another for 350 epochs). The paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are derived from the performance of the policies rather than standalone datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the behavior policies described in the paper, and I will summarize them accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of the datasets used in the research, ensuring to highlight the context and the policies involved in generating the datasets.
