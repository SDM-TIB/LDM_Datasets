To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigating Explanatory Multiverse Through Counterfactual Path Geometry" by Kacper Sokol et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach using the **German Credit** and **MNIST datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look specifically for sections that detail the datasets used, which are often found in sections titled **Datasets**, **Experiments**, or **Methodology**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **Section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments.

1. **German Credit Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of 20 categorical and numerical features, with a binary target variable indicating good or bad credit ratings. The dataset is commonly used in explainability studies.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, where each image is 28x28 pixels. The authors mention that they randomly selected 1,000 images of each digit for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hofmann, H. (1994). Statlog (German Credit Data). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
