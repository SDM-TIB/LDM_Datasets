To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Propagation Learning for Network-Wide Flight Delay Prediction" by Yuankai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with "two real-world delay datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **U.S. Delay Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) database, covering seven years of flight data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021. It includes data from 360 airports, but the authors selected 70 airports with heavier traffic volumes for their experiments.

2. **China Delay Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Xiecheng, covering two years of flight data from April 30, 2015, to May 1, 2017. It includes records from various weather categories and focuses on flights between 6 am and 12 pm.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **U.S. Delay Dataset**, the citation is:
> U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. *BTS Flight Data*. Available at: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DLSelectFields.asp?gnoyrVQ=.

For the **China Delay Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xiecheng. *Flight Data*. Available at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dEPyMGh#list/path=%2F.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research and validation.
