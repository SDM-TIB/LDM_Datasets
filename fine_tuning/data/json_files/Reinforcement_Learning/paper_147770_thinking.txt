To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to adapt: a meta-learning approach for speaker adaptation" by Ondřej Klejch, Joachim Fainberg, and Peter Bell, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improving automatic speech recognition systems through speaker adaptation, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention that all experiments were performed on **TED talks** and used the **TED-LIUM dataset** for training the acoustic models. They also mention testing on a combined test set of **IWSLT 2010, 2011, and 2012**.

I will gather the details about these datasets:

1. **TED-LIUM Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the acoustic models. It is a well-known dataset in the speech recognition community.

2. **IWSLT 2010, 2011, and 2012 Datasets**: These datasets are used for testing the models. They are part of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) evaluation campaigns.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TED-LIUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Rousseau, P. Deléglise, and Y. Estève. *Enhancing the TED-LIUM corpus with selected data for language modeling and more TED talks*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2014.

- For the **IWSLT datasets**, the citations are:
  > M. Paul, M. Federico, and S. Stücker. *Overview of the IWSLT 2010 evaluation campaign*. In IWSLT, 2010.
  > M. Federico, L. Bentivogli, M. Paul, and S. Stücker. *Overview of the IWSLT 2011 evaluation campaign*. In IWSLT, 2011.
  > M. Federico, M. Cettolo, L. Bentivogli, M. Paul, and S. Stücker. *Overview of the IWSLT 2012 evaluation campaign*. In IWSLT, 2012.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
