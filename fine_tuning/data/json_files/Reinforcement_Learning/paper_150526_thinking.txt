To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing the Cost of Cycle-Time Tuning for Real-World Policy Optimization" by Homayoon Farrahi and Rupam Mahmood, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of hyper-parameter tuning approaches on simulated and real-world robotic tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using two benchmark tasks: the **Reacher Task** and the **Double Pendulum Task**. I will note these tasks as they likely correspond to datasets used in the experiments.

I will also check the **validation section** where the authors mention validating their approaches on the **UR-Reacher-2 task**, which is a real-world robotic task. This indicates that the authors have utilized datasets related to these tasks for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset.

1. For the **Reacher Task**, the citation is:
   > Mahmood, A. R., Korenkevych, D., Vasan, G., Ma, W., Bergstra, J. (2018). *Benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms on real-world robots*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Robot Learning.

2. For the **Double Pendulum Task**, the citation is:
   > Tassa, Y., Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., Trochim, P., Liu, S., Bohez, S., Merel, J., Erez, T., Lillicrap, T., Heess, N. (2020). *dm_control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.12983.

3. For the **UR-Reacher-2 task**, the citation is:
   > Mahmood, A. R., Korenkevych, D., Vasan, G., Ma, W., Bergstra, J. (2018). *Benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms on real-world robots*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Robot Learning.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper effectively.
