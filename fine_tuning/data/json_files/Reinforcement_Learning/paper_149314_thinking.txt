To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Peers: Deep Transfer Reinforcement Learning for Joint Radio and Cache Resource Allocation in 5G RAN Slicing" by Hao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the context of the research.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather detailed information about each dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant metrics or features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to 5G RAN slicing, radio resource allocation, and cache resource allocation, as these are the main topics of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
