To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibration of the von Wolffersdorff model using Genetic Algorithms" by Francisco J. Mendez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the calibration of the von Wolffersdorff model using a synthetic dataset and experimental data from specific tests, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the calibration of the Sand Hypoplasticity (SH) model and mentions the need for experimental data from oedometer and triaxial tests, but does not specify dataset names yet.

I will then look into **section 4 (Results)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for calibration. Here, the authors mention using experimental data from von Wolffersdorff (1996) and Herle & Gudehus (1999) for the Hochstetten sand. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets used for validation.

In **section 4.3**, the authors specifically mention the experimental data obtained from two oedometer tests and three triaxial drained tests reported by von Wolffersdorff. This section provides the necessary context for the datasets used in their calibration procedure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the experimental data from von Wolffersdorff, the citation is:
   > von Wolffersdorff, V. (1996). A hypoplastic model for granular material with a predefined limit state surface. *Mechanics of Cohesive-Frictional Materials*, 1, 251-271.

2. For the experimental data from Herle & Gudehus, the citation is:
   > Herle, I., & Gudehus, G. (1999). Determination of parameters of a hypoplastic constitutive model from properties of grain assemblies. *Mechanics of Cohesive-Frictional Materials*, 4(5), 461-486.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
