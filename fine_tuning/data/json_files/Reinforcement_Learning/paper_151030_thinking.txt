To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Experience Replay" by Cong Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the use of "offline D4RL datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets being utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their evaluation on various environments, specifically mentioning the **D4RL** datasets, which are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will identify the specific datasets used. The paper refers to several environments from the D4RL suite, including:

1. **halfcheetah medium-replay**
2. **walker2d medium-replay**
3. **hopper medium-replay**
4. **maze2d environments** (including umaze, medium, and large)
5. **AntMaze environments**

I will also check the **results tables** for any additional datasets or variations mentioned. For instance, the paper discusses the performance of the SYNTHER method across various D4RL datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the D4RL datasets. The D4RL datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For the D4RL datasets, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. 2020. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219.

Next, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about each dataset, including their specific characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
