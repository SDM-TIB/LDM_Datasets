To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SYNERGY BETWEEN SYNAPTIC CONSOLIDATION AND EXPERIENCE REPLAY FOR GENERAL CONTINUAL LEARNING" by Fahad Sarfraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and empirical evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The authors may describe the challenges they address, which could hint at specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or datasets. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **empirical evaluation section** for any performance results that reference specific datasets. This section typically summarizes the findings and may include tables or figures that list the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

Based on the content of the paper, I expect to find datasets such as:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, often used in continual learning research.
2. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, used for similar tasks but with fewer classes.
3. **MNIST**: A classic dataset for handwritten digit recognition, frequently used in machine learning experiments.
4. **R-MNIST**: A variant of the MNIST dataset with rotated images, used to evaluate robustness to distribution shifts.
5. **GCIL (Generalized Class Incremental Learning)**: A dataset designed for testing class-incremental learning methods, which may have specific characteristics outlined in the paper.

Once I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Hadi Pouransari and Saman Ghili. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS231N course, Stanford University, 2015.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **R-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > David Lopez-Paz and Marc’Aurelio Ranzato. *Gradient Episodic Memory for Continual Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 6467–6476, 2017.

- For **GCIL**, the citation is:
  > Fei Mi, Lingjing Kong, Tao Lin, Kaicheng Yu, and Boi Faltings. *Generalized Class Incremental Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 240–241, 2020.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
