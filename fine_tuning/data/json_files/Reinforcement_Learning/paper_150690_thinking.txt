To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S Equilibrium: A Synthesis of (Behavioral) Game Theory" by Jacob K. Goeree and Bernardo Garc√≠a-Pola, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. If the authors mention any datasets or experiments, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors describe any experimental games or datasets, I will make sure to capture that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors refer to the datasets again, perhaps in the context of their findings or comparisons with other studies. This will help confirm the datasets' relevance and usage in the research.

Once I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Chain-Store Paradox" or any experimental datasets, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to write down the full citation for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
