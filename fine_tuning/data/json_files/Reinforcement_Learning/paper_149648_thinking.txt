To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Aware Scene Sampling for Dynamic Assurance of Autonomous Systems" by Shreyas Ramakrishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the need for labeled data from different operating modes of the system, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their experiments. In the introduction, they mention the use of synthetic data generated from simulators, specifically referencing the CARLA simulator. This indicates that there may be datasets related to the scenarios generated in this environment.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) case study and mention that they generated 250 scenes using their samplers. I will look for any specific datasets or sources of data that were used to train the models or evaluate the performance of the samplers.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references the CARLA simulator, which is a well-known open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. The citation for CARLA is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv:1711.03938.

Additionally, the authors mention using a calibration dataset that includes scenes with sensor faults and adverse weather conditions. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will note that it is a custom dataset generated for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for dataset mentions.
2. Focus on the experiments and evaluation sections for specific datasets used.
3. Check the references section for full citations of any mentioned datasets.
4. Document the findings, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.
