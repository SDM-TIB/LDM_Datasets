To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitation Learning by State-Only Distribution Matching" by Damian Boborzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on well-known continuous control environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to using expert demonstrations for training, which implies that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using expert data generated by training an expert policy based on conditional normalizing flows and the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. However, they do not specify the names of the datasets directly in the experiments section.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate the datasets used. The paper mentions several baseline methods and related works, which may reference datasets. I will look for any papers that are known to provide datasets for imitation learning or continuous control tasks.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations. For example, if the paper references the Pybullet physics simulation, I will note that the environments used (like Ant, HalfCheetah, etc.) are part of the datasets provided by the Pybullet framework.

Finally, I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset mentioned or implied in the paper. If specific datasets are not named, I will note that the paper uses expert data generated from simulations, which may not correspond to publicly available datasets.

In summary, I will:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or mentions in the methodology/experiments sections.
3. Check the references for any relevant citations that indicate datasets.
4. Compile the findings and ensure to include full citations for each dataset identified.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
