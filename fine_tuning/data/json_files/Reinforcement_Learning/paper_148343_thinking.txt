To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of Deep Q-Network in Portfolio Management" by Ziming Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their model on "five low-relevant American stocks," which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look closely at the **experimental section (Section IX)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that they selected five US stocks from Yahoo Finance, specifically the stock codes: CAH, CAT, CCE, CCL, and DIS. This gives me the names of the stocks used in their dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the source of the stock data. The authors state that they obtained the stock data from Yahoo Finance, which is a widely recognized financial data provider. However, since Yahoo Finance is not a formal citation, I will note it as the source of the dataset.

The relevant dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: US Stock Data for Portfolio Management
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of historical price data for five US stocks (CAH, CAT, CCE, CCL, DIS) obtained from Yahoo Finance. The data includes prices over a specified period used for training and backtesting the Deep Q-Network model.
   - **Source**: Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/)

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset source. Since Yahoo Finance is a website and not a traditional academic reference, I will provide the URL as the citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
