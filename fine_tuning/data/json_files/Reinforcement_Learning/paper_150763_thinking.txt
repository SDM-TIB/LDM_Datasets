To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Sample Efficiency of Model-Free Algorithms for Zero-Sum Markov Games" by Songtao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any statements regarding the datasets used for evaluation or comparison. This section often highlights the significance of the datasets in the context of the research.

I will then focus on the **methodology or experiments section**, where the authors usually describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will take note of any specific dataset names and their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the "OpenAI Gym" for experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
