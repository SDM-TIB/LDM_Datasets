To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Credit Assignment: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Human-like AI Agents" by Thuy Ngoc Nguyen, Chase McDonald, and Cleotilde Gonzalez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves human and model simulation data, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental design. They mention conducting two human experiments based on interactive browser-based gridworld applications. This implies that there are datasets related to human performance in these experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the models and human participants, which may reference the datasets used for analysis. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that summarize the data collected during the experiments.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to datasets. The authors mention that all human and model simulation data, model code, and scripts are available on the Open Science Framework, which is a crucial piece of information for locating the datasets.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Human Experiment Data**: This dataset includes performance metrics from 305 participants in Experiment 1 and 301 participants in Experiment 2, focusing on their navigation through gridworld tasks. The data includes proportions of target consumption and decision-making strategies.

2. **Model Simulation Data**: This dataset consists of synthetic data generated from simulations of various models (IBL-Equal, IBL-Exponential, IBL-TD, and Q-learning) across different gridworld configurations. The simulations were run to compare model performance against human data.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **human experiment data**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T. N., McDonald, C., & Gonzalez, C. (2023). *Credit Assignment: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Human-like AI Agents*. Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University. Available at Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/ue4tv/?view_only=28204c18941042cab2555097422706b9.

- For the **model simulation data**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T. N., McDonald, C., & Gonzalez, C. (2023). *Credit Assignment: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Human-like AI Agents*. Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University. Available at Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/ue4tv/?view_only=28204c18941042cab2555097422706b9.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
