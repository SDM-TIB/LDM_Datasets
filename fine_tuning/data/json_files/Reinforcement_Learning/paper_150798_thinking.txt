To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Career Path Recommendations for Long-term Income Maximization: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Spyros Avlonitis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study leverages data from Randstad The Netherlands, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their attributes and the context in which they were used.

The paper mentions two primary datasets:

1. **Work Experience Dataset**: This dataset consists of work experience items submitted by employees to Randstad. It includes attributes such as Employee ID, job start and end dates, ISCO codes, and SBI codes. This dataset is crucial for understanding the work history of employees.

2. **Vacancies Dataset**: This dataset contains salary ranges for approximately six million vacancies, including ISCO and SBI codes. It is used to estimate expected salaries for various occupations, which is essential for the study's focus on income maximization.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since these datasets are proprietary and specific to Randstad, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that they are derived from Randstad's internal data.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

- **Work Experience Dataset**: 
  - Description: A tabular dataset containing work experience items submitted by employees, including Employee ID, job start and end dates, ISCO codes, and SBI codes.
  - Citation: Data sourced from Randstad The Netherlands.

- **Vacancies Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset with salary ranges for about six million vacancies, including ISCO and SBI codes, used to estimate expected salaries.
  - Citation: Data sourced from Randstad The Netherlands.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research.
