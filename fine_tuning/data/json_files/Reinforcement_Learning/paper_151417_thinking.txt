To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guiding Attention in End-to-End Driving Models" by Diego Porres et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using the **CARLA simulator** for experiments, which suggests that the datasets may be derived from this simulator.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **14-hour dataset**: This dataset was collected in Town01 of the CARLA simulator and includes various weather conditions. It consists of eight hours of driving with a busy object density and additional hours recorded with an empty object map.

2. **55-hour dataset**: This dataset spans multiple towns (Town01 to Town06) and includes diverse driving scenarios such as multi-lane driving and highways. It features a broader set of vehicle commands compared to the 14-hour dataset.

In **section 4.1**, the authors provide details about the conditions under which these datasets were collected, including the number of driving hours and the variety of weather conditions, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are derived from the CARLA simulator, I will cite the CARLA paper as the authoritative source for these datasets:

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio M. LÃ³pez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
