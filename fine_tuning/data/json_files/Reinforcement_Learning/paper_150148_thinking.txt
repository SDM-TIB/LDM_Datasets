To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full-Text Argumentation Mining on Scientific Publications" by Arne Binder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a sequential pipeline model and references the Sci-Arg corpus, indicating that this is a dataset used in their work.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state that they use the **Sci-Arg dataset** for model training and evaluation. This section provides key details about the dataset, including that it contains 40 full-text publications annotated with argumentative discourse units (ADUs) and argumentative relations.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results** or **discussion** sections, but it appears that the Sci-Arg dataset is the primary focus for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Sci-Arg dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- **Sci-Arg Dataset**: 
  > Lauscher, A., Glavaš, G., & Ponzetto, S. P. (2018b). An argument-annotated corpus of scientific publications. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Argument Mining (pp. 40–46). Brussels, Belgium: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
