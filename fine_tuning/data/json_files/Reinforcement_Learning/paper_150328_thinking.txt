To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Local Planning" by Dong Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in Section 6, where they evaluate their approach on various environments. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets or environments that are explicitly mentioned.

In Section 6.1, the authors mention two environments from the **bsuite**: **Deep Sea** and **Cartpole Swingup**. They describe the characteristics of these environments, which are crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments. Additionally, they reference four Atari games: **Montezumaâ€™s Revenge**, **PrivateEye**, **Venture**, and **Pitfall**. These environments are also important datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references may include papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail. 

For the **bsuite environments**, the citation is:
- **bsuite**: Osband, I., Blundell, C., Pritzel, A., & Van Roy, B. (2019). *Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.03568.

For the **Atari games**, the citation is:
- **Arcade Learning Environment**: Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
