To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Band-based Adversarial Training for Generalized Attack Immunity of A3C Path Finding" by Tong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method for generating adversarial examples and training for immunity against them, which suggests that there may be datasets used for testing or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any datasets that may be referenced. The authors discuss adversarial attacks in various domains, including automatic path finding, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the experimental environment and data used. They mention that the experiments are conducted on a grid-world of size N Ã— N with randomly placed obstacles, which indicates that they are using generated datasets rather than publicly available ones. However, they also mention using 10,000 map samples generated randomly under 10 different categories of map size, which is important to note.

I will also check the **results and evaluation sections** to see if any specific datasets are referenced in the context of their experiments. The authors provide statistics on the generation and immune precision under various map sizes, but they do not cite any external datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of prior work or methodologies that could be relevant. However, it appears that the datasets used in this paper are primarily generated by the authors for their specific experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Generated Map Samples**: The authors created a dataset consisting of 10,000 randomly generated map samples for their experiments, categorized into 10 different map sizes (e.g., 10x10, 20x20, etc.). This dataset is not publicly available and was specifically designed for the study.

2. **No External Datasets Cited**: The paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets used in the experiments.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the generation of datasets for its experiments, it does not provide citations for any external datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are internally generated and not sourced from existing repositories. This will be important for anyone looking to replicate the study or understand the data context.
