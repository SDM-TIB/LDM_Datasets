To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Variance in Temporal-Difference Value Estimation via Ensemble of Deep Networks" by Litian Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, MeanQ, is evaluated on the **Atari Learning Environment benchmark**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors state that they conducted experiments on a **set of 26 benchmark Atari environments**. This suggests that the Atari Learning Environment is the primary dataset being referenced.

To ensure I have the correct citation for this dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The Atari Learning Environment is commonly cited in reinforcement learning literature, and I will look for the original source. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:

- **Atari Learning Environment**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Atari Learning Environment** is the only dataset used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
