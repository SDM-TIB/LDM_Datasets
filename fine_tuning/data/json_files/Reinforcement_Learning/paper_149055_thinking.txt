To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vietnamese Complaint Detection on E-Commerce Websites" by Nhung Thi-Hong Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **UIT-ViOCD**, which is a Vietnamese Open-domain Complaint Detection dataset containing 5,485 human-annotated reviews. This indicates that there is a dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the UIT-ViOCD dataset. They describe the dataset's size, the nature of the reviews, and the categories it covers (fashion, cosmetics, applications, and phones). This section confirms that UIT-ViOCD is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

In the **dataset analysis** subsection, the authors provide insights into the distribution of complaints and non-complaints, which further emphasizes the dataset's significance. They also mention the annotation process and the inter-annotator agreement, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UIT-ViOCD dataset. Since this dataset is introduced in the paper itself and does not reference another source, I will cite the paper as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The citation for the UIT-ViOCD dataset is:
> Nhung Thi-Hong Nguyen, Phuong Phan-Dieu Ha, Luan Thanh Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen, and Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen. *Vietnamese Complaint Detection on E-Commerce Websites*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE), pages 1-10, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for UIT-ViOCD, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for UIT-ViOCD, ensuring it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
