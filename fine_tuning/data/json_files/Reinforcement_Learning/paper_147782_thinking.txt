To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Across Multi-Objective Reward Functions in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Eli Friedman and Fred Fontaine, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of experience replay datasets but does not specify any particular datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors reference the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm developed by Andrychowicz et al. (2017). This section does not mention specific datasets either, but it indicates that the authors are building upon existing work that may involve datasets.

In **section 2 (Background)** and **section 2.1 (Hindsight Experience Replay)**, the authors describe the HER method and its application to goal-based rewards. However, they still do not specify any datasets used in their experiments.

Moving on to **section 4 (Environment)**, the authors describe the environments used for testing their algorithm, specifically a double integrator environment. They mention that the agent controls a particle moving along a line and receives a two-dimensional reward. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name here either.

In **section 5 (Results)**, the authors present results from their experiments but again do not mention any datasets. They discuss the performance of their algorithm in various environments but do not provide citations for any datasets.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily include foundational papers and algorithms related to reinforcement learning and do not list specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Instead, they focus on the methodology and results of their proposed algorithm without referencing specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have provided their full citations as required.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in this paper and ensure to note the absence of dataset citations.
