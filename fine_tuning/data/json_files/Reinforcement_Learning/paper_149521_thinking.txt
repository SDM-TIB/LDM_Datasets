To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Reward Machines: A Study in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning" by Rodrigo Toro Icarte et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in various partially observable domains. I will pay particular attention to any specific datasets or environments they refer to, such as the **cookie domain**, **symbol domain**, and **2-keys domain**. Each of these domains may represent a unique dataset or experimental setup.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on previous works or established benchmarks. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to include the full citation for that dataset. If they describe a novel dataset created for this research, I will document its details as provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
4. Document each dataset with its details and citations for clarity and completeness.
