To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Sample Complexity of Teaching-by-Reinforcement on Q-Learning" by Xuezhou Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to identify any datasets used for empirical evaluation. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as they may summarize datasets or provide additional context about their usage in experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will ensure to note the following details for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for its citation, which might be:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

By following this methodical approach, I can ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
