To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Resolution Enhancement Plug-in for Deformable Registration of Medical Images" by Kaicong Sun and Sven Simon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on the **LPBA40 brain MRI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section IV (Experiments and Results), the authors explicitly state that they utilized the **LPBA40 dataset**, which contains brain MR images of 40 neurologically intact nonepileptic subjects with segmentation labels for 56 brain regions. They also describe how the images were processed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LPBA40 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **LPBA40 dataset**:
  > D. W. Shattuck et al., "Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures," *Neuroimage*, vol. 39, no. 3, pp. 1064â€“1080, 2008.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its citation, into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes all necessary details, including the citation, to maintain proper academic referencing.
