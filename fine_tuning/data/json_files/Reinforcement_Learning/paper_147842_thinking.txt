To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for optimizing traffic light control policies, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains details about the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. In this section, the authors describe simulations for both a single-intersection scenario and a linear road topology. They mention using random variables for vehicle arrivals but do not explicitly name any datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references may include foundational datasets or benchmarks that the authors used in their experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets by name. Instead, they describe the simulation setup and the types of data generated (e.g., vehicle arrivals modeled as Bernoulli distributed random variables). Since no formal datasets are cited, I will note that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

However, I will still provide the full citation for the paper itself, as it may be relevant for future reference or for readers interested in the context of the research:

- Liu, X.-Y., Ding, Z., Borst, S., & Walid, A. (2018). Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems. In Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2018), Montr√©al, Canada.

In conclusion, while I did not find any specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I have documented the citation for the paper itself, which may be useful for readers looking for more information on the research conducted.
