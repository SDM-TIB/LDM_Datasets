To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "B-SCST: Bayesian Self-Critical Sequence Training for Image Captioning" by Shashank Bujimalla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they improve CIDEr-D scores on **Flickr30k, MS COCO, and VizWiz image captioning datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Flickr30k**: This dataset contains 31,014 training images, 1,014 validation images, and 1,000 test images, each with 5 ground truth captions. The authors also mention specific preprocessing steps and the vocabulary size used.

2. **MS COCO**: This dataset includes 113,287 training images, 5,000 validation images, and 5,000 test images, each with 5 ground truth captions. Similar to Flickr30k, they describe the preprocessing and vocabulary size.

3. **VizWiz**: This dataset consists of 22,866 training images, 7,542 validation images, and 8,000 test images, each having up to 5 ground truth captions. The authors explain how they combined training and validation images for their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Flickr30k**, the citation is:
  > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 2641–2649, 2015.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

- For **VizWiz**, the citation is:
  > Danna Gurari, Yinan Zhao, Meng Zhang, and Nilavra Bhattacharya. *Captioning images taken by people who are blind*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.08565, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
