To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoding-Time Language Model Alignment with Multiple Objectives" by Ruizhe Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about their content, size, and purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Summarize-from-Feedback Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Reddit Summary task. It is referenced as being available on Hugging Face.

2. **Anthropic-HH Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the Helpful Assistant task, also available on Hugging Face.

3. **BeaverTails-10K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of Safety Alignment, and it is also available on Hugging Face.

4. **HelpSteer Dataset**: This dataset is used for the HelpSteer task, and it is available on Hugging Face as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations should include the authors, title, source, and year of publication, if applicable.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Summarize-from-Feedback Dataset**:
  > OpenAI. *Summarize from Feedback*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/summarize_from_feedback.

- **Anthropic-HH Dataset**:
  > Anthropic. *Anthropic-HH Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf.

- **BeaverTails-10K Dataset**:
  > PKU-Alignment. *BeaverTails-10K Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF-10K.

- **HelpSteer Dataset**:
  > NVIDIA. *HelpSteer Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
