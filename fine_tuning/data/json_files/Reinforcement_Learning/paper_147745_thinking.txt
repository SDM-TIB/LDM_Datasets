To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Summarisation by Classification with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kaiyang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **TVSum**: This dataset contains 10 categories, each with 5 videos, and the lengths of the videos vary from 2 to 10 minutes. The authors note that the dataset was annotated by multiple persons, resulting in multiple human summaries for each video.

2. **CoSum**: This dataset consists of 51 videos covering 10 categories, with video lengths ranging from 1 to 12 minutes. Similar to TVSum, CoSum was also annotated by multiple individuals.

In this section, the authors provide enough detail about the datasets, including their structure and the nature of the annotations, which confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TVSum**, the citation is:
  > Yale Song, Jordi Vallmitjana, Amanda Stent, and Alejandro Jaimes. *TVSum: Summarizing web videos using titles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **CoSum**, the citation is:
  > Wen-Sheng Chu, Yale Song, and Alejandro Jaimes. *Video co-summarization: Video summarization by visual co-occurrence*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
