To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Theoretic Model Predictive Q-Learning" by Mohak Bhardwaj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention several tasks and environments, which may imply the use of specific datasets or simulation environments.

Upon reviewing the **experimental setup**, I find that the authors describe four tasks: 

1. **PENDULUMSWINGUP**: This task involves a pendulum that the agent tries to swing up and stabilize. The authors mention that the initial state is randomized after every episode, but they do not specify a dataset in the traditional sense.

2. **BALLINCUPSPARSE**: This task is a sparse version of a task from the DeepMind Control Suite. Again, while the authors describe the task, they do not explicitly mention a dataset.

3. **FETCHPUSHBLOCK**: This task involves controlling a robot gripper to push a block to a goal location. Similar to the previous tasks, the authors describe the task but do not provide a dataset citation.

4. **FRANKADRAWEROPEN**: This task is based on a real-world manipulation problem. The authors reference a previous work by Chebotar et al. (2019) for this task, which may imply the use of a dataset from that work.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The only relevant citation that may correspond to a dataset is:

- For the **FRANKADRAWEROPEN** task, the citation is:
  > Yevgen Chebotar, Ankur Handa, Viktor Makoviychuk, Miles Macklin, Jan Issac, Nathan Ratliff, and Dieter Fox. *Closing the sim-to-real loop: Adapting simulation randomization with real world experience*. In 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 8973â€“8979. IEEE, 2019.

Since the other tasks do not reference specific datasets, I will note that the experiments are conducted in simulated environments (e.g., MuJoCo) rather than traditional datasets.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **PENDULUMSWINGUP**: No specific dataset citation.
2. **BALLINCUPSPARSE**: No specific dataset citation.
3. **FETCHPUSHBLOCK**: No specific dataset citation.
4. **FRANKADRAWEROPEN**: Referenced work for task context.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
