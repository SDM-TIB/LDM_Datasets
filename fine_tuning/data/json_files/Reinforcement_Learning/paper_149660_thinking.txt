To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning for distributed control of residential energy flexibility" by Flora Charbonnier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of "large real-life datasets" for case studies, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Input Data)**, where the authors describe the data used to populate their model. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Customer Led Network Revolution (CLNR)**: This dataset is used for load and PV generation profiles, which are crucial for the study. The authors specify that it includes data from 11,907 customers between 2011 and 2014, yielding 620,702 full days of data.

2. **National Travel Survey (NTS)**: This dataset provides mobility data and is noted for its comprehensive view of travel patterns across 82,455 households from 2002 to 2017, resulting in 1,272,834 full days of travel profiles.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Customer Led Network Revolution (CLNR)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Wardle, R. (2014). Dataset (TC1a): Basic Profiling of Domestic Smart Meter Customers. 

- For the **National Travel Survey (NTS)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Department for Transport. (2019). National Travel Survey 2002-2017. doi:http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5340-10.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their respective citations.
