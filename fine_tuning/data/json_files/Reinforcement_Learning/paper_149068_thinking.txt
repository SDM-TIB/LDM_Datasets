To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Linear Convergence of Natural Policy Gradient Algorithm" by Sajad Khodadadian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and if datasets are used for experiments, they are often mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used). I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive details about each dataset used in the study. This section may include information about the source of the datasets, their purpose, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **OpenAI Gym** dataset for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
