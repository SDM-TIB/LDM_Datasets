To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-Space Planning with Subgoal Models" by Chunlok Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

While reviewing these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will record its name and any details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will ensure that it is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or presentation.

By following this structured approach, I can effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I capture all necessary details for future reference or use.
