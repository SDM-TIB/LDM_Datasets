To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Argument Mining for Discussion Threads Based on Parallel Constrained Pointer Architecture" by Gaku Morio and Katsuhide Fujita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have annotated a large-scale civic discussion dataset, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Argument Mining for Discussion Thread)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they have annotated a large-scale online civic discussion dataset obtained from COLLAGREE, which includes various statistics about the dataset, such as the number of threads, posts, sentences, and tokens.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Civic Discussion Dataset**: This dataset consists of 399 threads, 1327 posts, 5559 sentences, and 120241 tokens, all in Japanese. It was collected from an online civic engagement initiative co-hosted by the government of Nagoya City, Japan.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work for the dataset annotation, which is:
- Morio, Gaku, and Katsuhide Fujita. "Annotating online civic discussion threads for argument mining." In 2018 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI), page (to appear).

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Civic Discussion Dataset**: Annotated from COLLAGREE, containing 399 threads, 1327 posts, 5559 sentences, and 120241 tokens in Japanese.
   - Citation: Morio, Gaku, and Katsuhide Fujita. "Annotating online civic discussion threads for argument mining." In 2018 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI), page (to appear).

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
