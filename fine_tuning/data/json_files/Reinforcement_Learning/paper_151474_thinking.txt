To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biological Neurons Compete with Deep Reinforcement Learning in Sample Efficiency in a Simulated Gameworld" by Moein Khajehnejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often details the data sources, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the datasets again when discussing their findings. This is a good opportunity to confirm the datasets mentioned earlier and to gather additional details about their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access the same data.

For this paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be mentioned:

1. **DishBrain Dataset**: This dataset is likely derived from the DishBrain system, which uses in vitro neuronal networks. I will look for details on how this dataset was generated and any relevant citations.

2. **Deep Reinforcement Learning Baselines**: The paper compares biological neurons with deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, A2C, PPO). I will check if the authors used any standard datasets associated with these algorithms, such as the Atari game datasets.

3. **Human and Mouse Cortical Cell Data**: The authors mention using human cortical cells (HCC) and mouse cortical cells (MCC) in their experiments. I will look for any datasets related to these biological samples.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, making sure to include all necessary details for each dataset, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.
