To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Dialogue Utterance Rewriting as Sequence Tagging" by Jie Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in dialogue rewriting and reference previous works, which may lead to the identification of datasets. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **REWRITE** and **RESTORATION**. I will note the details provided about each dataset, including their sizes and characteristics.

1. **REWRITE Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset consists of 18,000 training examples, 1,000 validation examples, and 1,000 test examples. It is specifically designed for the dialogue rewriting task.

2. **RESTORATION Dataset**: This dataset is larger, with 194,000 training examples, 5,000 validation examples, and 5,000 test examples. It is also used for the dialogue rewriting task and is noted for its complexity and size.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The authors reference the original papers that describe these datasets:

- For the **REWRITE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Su, H., Shen, X., Zhang, R., Sun, F., Hu, P., Niu, C., & Zhou, J. (2019). Improving multi-turn dialogue modelling with utterance ReWriter. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 22-31). Florence, Italy.

- For the **RESTORATION dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pan, Z., Bai, K., Wang, Y., Zhou, L., & Liu, X. (2019). Improving open-domain dialogue systems via multi-turn incomplete utterance restoration. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1824-1833). Hong Kong, China.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
