To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empowerment-driven Exploration using Mutual Information Estimation" by Navneet Madhu Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of empowerment as an intrinsic reward signal for reinforcement learning, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (section 3) more closely. Here, the author describes the agent's architecture and training process, but I need to look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Upon reviewing the text, I notice that the paper specifically mentions the game **Montezuma’s Revenge** as the environment in which the proposed method is tested. This indicates that the dataset in question is related to this game, which is part of the Atari game suite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for Montezuma’s Revenge, as it is a well-known game in the Atari suite and does not have a specific dataset paper associated with it. Instead, it is commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **Montezuma’s Revenge**: This is the primary environment used for the experiments, but it is not formally cited as a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it is recognized as a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper does not provide a formal citation for a dataset, the use of Montezuma’s Revenge is acknowledged as part of the experimental setup. I will document this information clearly, emphasizing that it is a common benchmark in the field.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
