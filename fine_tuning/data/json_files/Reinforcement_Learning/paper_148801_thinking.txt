To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Radio Environment Monitoring for Next Generation Wireless Networks" by Halise TÃ¼rkmen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the G-REM framework but does not mention specific datasets. I will then check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there may not be a clear section labeled "Datasets," but I will search for any mentions of data sources or datasets used in the experiments or applications discussed.

As I read through the **applications and challenges sections**, I will pay attention to any examples or case studies that might reference specific datasets. The authors discuss various applications of the G-REM framework, but I need to confirm if they cite any datasets used for validation or testing.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the original sources accurately.

For example, if they mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" in the context of their experiments, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset and note its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source.

By following this step-by-step approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations.
