To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization with Adaptive Threshold for Symmetric Relative Density Ratio" by Taisuke Kobayashi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning and mentions benchmark simulations, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (likely section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the simulations. This section typically provides the most explicit information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the benchmark simulations. If the paper describes the environments used for testing the proposed method, I will note down the names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Pybullet** environments for simulations, I will look for the citation that corresponds to the Pybullet library, which is likely to be:
> Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2016). Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning. GitHub repository.

If the paper refers to specific benchmark tasks like **InvertedPendulum** or **Hopper**, I will ensure to find their respective citations as well, which may be included in the references or could be sourced from other foundational papers in reinforcement learning.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper attribution to the original sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets and their citations.
