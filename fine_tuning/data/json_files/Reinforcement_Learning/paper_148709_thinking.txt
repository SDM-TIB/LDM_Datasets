To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Weighted Heterogeneous Graph Based Dialogue System" by Xinyan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their dialogue system is evaluated using two public disease diagnosis dialogue datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection labeled **IV. EMPIRICAL STUDY**. Here, the authors explicitly describe two datasets:

1. **MZ dataset**: This dataset was collected from the Baidu Muzhi Doctor website and contains 710 dialogue goals involving 4 types of diseases (infantile diarrhea, children functional dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, and children’s bronchitis) and 66 types of symptoms. The training set consists of 568 dialogues, while the test set has 142 dialogues.

2. **DX dataset**: Collected from an online health-care website (dxy.com), this dataset includes 527 real medical diagnosis dialogues covering five diseases (pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and hand-foot-mouth disease) and 41 symptoms. The training set comprises 423 dialogues, with 104 dialogues reserved for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MZ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wei, Z., Liu, Q., Peng, B., Tou, H., Chen, T., Huang, X., Wong, K., & Dai, X. (2018). Task-oriented dialogue system for automatic diagnosis. In Proceedings of the Association for the 56th Annual Meeting of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2018), Melbourne, Australia, July 15-20, 2018, Volume 2: Short Papers, pp. 201–207.

- For the **DX dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, L., Zhou, Q., Gong, K., Liang, X., Tang, J., & Lin, L. (2019). End-to-end knowledge-routed relational dialogue system for automatic diagnosis. In The Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2019), Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, January 27 - February 1, 2019, pp. 7346–7353.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems.
