To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte Carlo Scene Search for 3D Scene Understanding" by Shreyas Hampali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their approach on the **ScanNet dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their method's performance. They mention using the **ScanNet dataset** for evaluating their method, which confirms its significance in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ScanNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias NieÃŸner. *ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **methodology section**, the authors refer to **ShapeNet** for generating synthetic point clouds. This indicates that ShapeNet is also a dataset used in their experiments.

I will check the **References section** again for the full citation of the ShapeNet dataset. The citation is:
> Angel X. Chang, Thomas A. Funkhouser, Leonidas J. Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qi-Xing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. CoRR, abs/1512.03012, 2015.

Now, I have identified two datasets used in the research:

1. **ScanNet Dataset**
2. **ShapeNet Dataset**

I will compile the information about these datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the datasets used in the research.
