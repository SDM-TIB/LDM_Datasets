To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "OpenHEXAI: An Open-Source Framework for Human-Centered Evaluation of Explainable Machine Learning" by Jiaqi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework includes a "collection of diverse benchmark datasets," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The OpenHEXAI Framework)**, particularly the **Machine Learning Module** subsection, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets available in OpenHEXAI. Here, they list several datasets along with their respective domains, sizes, and features.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is used in the finance domain and has 1,000 instances with 20 features, including a protected attribute (gender).

2. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,871 instances and is also in the finance domain, with 23 features, including a protected attribute (gender).

3. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset has 45,222 instances and is used in the finance domain, with 13 features, including a protected attribute (gender).

4. **Give Me Some Credit Dataset**: This dataset contains 102,209 instances and is in the finance domain, with 10 features, including a protected attribute (gender).

5. **RCDV Dataset**: This dataset is used in the criminal justice domain and has 9,549 instances with 16 features, including protected attributes (gender and ethnicity).

6. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset has 6,162 instances and is also in the criminal justice domain, with 7 features, including protected attributes (gender and ethnicity).

7. **Student Admission Dataset**: This dataset is in the education domain and contains 100 instances with 29 features, with no protected attributes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
