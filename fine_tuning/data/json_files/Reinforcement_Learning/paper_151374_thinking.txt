To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Imitation Learning via Boosting" by Jonathan D. Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **DeepMind Control Suite** for their experiments. This suite is a collection of continuous control tasks that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. I will need to gather more details about this suite to provide a complete citation.

In the **dataset details section (B.2)**, the authors specify that they trained expert policies for state-based and image-based environments using the DeepMind Control Suite. They also provide performance metrics for various tasks within this suite, which indicates that these tasks are part of the dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the necessary citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., de Las Casas, D., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Next, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper. If there are any additional datasets referenced in the related works or other sections, I will document those as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
