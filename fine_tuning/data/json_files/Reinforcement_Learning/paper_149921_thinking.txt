To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An AlphaZero-Inspired Approach to Solving Search Problems" by Evgeny Dantsin, Vladik Kreinovich, and Alexander Wolpert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss examples and setups** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the adaptation of AlphaZero techniques for solving search problems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Examples for the SatisÔ¨Åability Problem)**, as it seems to provide setups related to the satisfiability problem, which may include datasets or references to datasets used in the context of SAT solving. 

In this section, the authors describe various setups for the satisfiability problem, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they refer to the general concept of SAT instances and solutions, which are common in the field. I will look for any references to datasets in the examples provided.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various works related to SAT solving and combinatorial optimization, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note that the authors discuss the use of "industrial instances of SAT" and "curriculum learning" for training neural networks, which implies that they may be using datasets from existing SAT benchmarks or repositories. However, without specific names or citations, I cannot extract formal dataset entries.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses concepts and methodologies relevant to SAT solving, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will summarize the findings without creating dataset entries, as there are no explicit datasets to cite.
