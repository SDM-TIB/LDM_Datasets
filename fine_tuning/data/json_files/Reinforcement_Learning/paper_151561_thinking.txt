To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post-hoc Utterance Refining Method by Entity Mining for Faithful Knowledge Grounded Conversations" by Yoonna Jang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three KGC datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **FoCus**: This dataset is described as having conversations about world landmarks, consisting of 14,452 conversations and 173,424 utterances. The authors reference their own previous work for this dataset.
   
2. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**: This dataset is noted for its conversational format based on Wikipedia articles, containing 22,311 conversations. The authors cite the original paper that introduced this dataset.

3. **CMUDoG**: This dataset involves conversations based on movie Wikipedia articles and includes 4,112 conversations. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FoCus**, the citation is:
  > Yoonna Jang, Jungwoo Lim, Yuna Hur, Dongsuk Oh, Suhyune Son, Yeonsoo Lee, Donghoon Shin, Seungryong Kim, and Heuiseok Lim. *Call for customized conversation: Customized conversation grounding persona and knowledge*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 36, pages 10803–10812, 2022.

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**, the citation is:
  > Emily Dinan, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, and Jason Weston. *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.01241, 2018.

- For **CMUDoG**, the citation is:
  > Kangyan Zhou, Shrimai Prabhumoye, and Alan W Black. *A dataset for document grounded conversations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 708–713, 2018.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
