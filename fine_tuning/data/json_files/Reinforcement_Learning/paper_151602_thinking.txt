To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Robotic Arm Control" by Jonaid Shianifar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on hyperparameter optimization for deep reinforcement learning algorithms, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges of controlling robotic arms and mentions the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **materials and methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe the experimental setup involving the Franka Emika Panda arm in a simulated environment, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the evaluation of the algorithms. The authors discuss the performance of the algorithms but do not mention any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references include various papers related to deep reinforcement learning and robotic control, but I need to identify if any of these papers correspond to datasets used in the current study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they refer to the **Franka Emika Panda arm** and the **panda gym** simulation environment, which are crucial for the experiments conducted. 

To provide full citations for these references, I will look up the relevant papers:

1. For the **Franka Emika Panda arm**, the citation is:
   > Q. Gallouédec, N. Cazin, E. Dellandrèa, and L. Chen. *Panda-gym: Open-robotic learning for source goal-conditioned environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.13687, 2021.

2. For the **panda gym** simulation environment, the citation is:
   > E. Coumans and Y. Bai. *Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. http://pybullet.org, 2016–2021.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather focuses on the simulation environment and the robotic arm, I will document these references as the relevant sources for the experimental setup.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for review or downstream processing.
