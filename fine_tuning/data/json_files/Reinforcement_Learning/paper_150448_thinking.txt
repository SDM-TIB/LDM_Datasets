To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessor-Guided Learning for Continual Environments" by Muhammad Anwar Ma’suma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not specify datasets. I will then check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention four datasets used to examine the advantages of their proposed method: 

1. **Split MNIST (SMNIST)**: This dataset is commonly used for continual learning tasks and consists of images of handwritten digits.
2. **Split CIFAR10 (SCIFAR10)**: A subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
3. **Split CIFAR100 (SCIFAR100)**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **Split Mini-ImageNet (SMINIIMAGENET)**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, often used for few-shot learning tasks.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for these datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Split MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proc. IEEE*, 86, 2278–2324.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T. P., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *NIPS*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain the proper format and include all necessary details for each dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
