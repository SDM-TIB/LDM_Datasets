To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Deep Q-learning Algorithms" by Justin Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not mention specific datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experimental setup** and **methods** sections, as these sections typically describe the data used for experiments. In the **Experimental Setup** section, the authors mention using a suite of tabular environments and continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that datasets or environments are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

In the **Appendices**, particularly in section A, the authors describe the benchmark tabular domains used for evaluation. They mention several environments:

1. **Gridworlds**: Various grid environments with different configurations.
2. **Cliffwalk**: A toy example from Schaul et al. (2015).
3. **InvertedPendulum**: A discretized version of a continuous control task.
4. **MountainCar**: Another discretized continuous control task.
5. **SparseGraph**: A randomly connected graph environment.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. The paper cites several foundational works related to the environments used:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., and Zaremba, W. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. 2018.

- For **Cliffwalk**, the citation is:
  > Schaul, T., Quan, J., Antonoglou, I., and Silver, D. *Prioritized experience replay*. International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2015.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format. 

1. **Gridworlds**: Various configurations of grid environments.
   - Citation: Not specifically cited, but based on common reinforcement learning environments.

2. **Cliffwalk**: A toy example from Schaul et al. (2015).
   - Citation: Schaul, T., Quan, J., Antonoglou, I., and Silver, D. *Prioritized experience replay*. International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2015.

3. **InvertedPendulum**: A discretized version of a continuous control task.
   - Citation: Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., and Zaremba, W. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. 2018.

4. **MountainCar**: Another discretized continuous control task.
   - Citation: Plappert, M., Andrychowicz, M., Ray, A., McGrew, B., Baker, B., Powell, G., Schneider, J., Tobin, J., Chociej, M., Welinder, P., Kumar, V., and Zaremba, W. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. 2018.

5. **SparseGraph**: A randomly connected graph environment.
   - Citation: Not specifically cited, but based on common reinforcement learning environments.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
