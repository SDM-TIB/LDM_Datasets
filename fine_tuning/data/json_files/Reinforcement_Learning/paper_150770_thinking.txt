To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Few-Shot Coordination: Revisiting Ad-Hoc Teamplay Challenge in the Game of Hanabi" by Hadi Nekoei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of various algorithms in the context of the game Hanabi, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors refer to a **pool of diverse pre-trained agents** and mention that they evaluate the adaptability of these agents in the game of Hanabi. They do not explicitly name a dataset in the traditional sense (like a benchmark dataset), but they do refer to the **Hanabi game** itself as a benchmark environment for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the Hanabi game or any datasets that might have been used in previous works. The references may provide insights into the original sources of the game or any datasets that have been created for it.

The relevant citations I find will be crucial for documenting the datasets. For example, if the authors reference the original Hanabi game paper or any datasets associated with it, I will ensure to include those citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or benchmark mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
