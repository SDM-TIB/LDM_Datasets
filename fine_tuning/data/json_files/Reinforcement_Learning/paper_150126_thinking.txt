To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Model Interpretability: On the Faithfulness and Adversarial Robustness of Contrastive Textual Explanations" by Julia El Zini and Mariette Awad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on sentiment analysis data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. In this paper, the authors refer to using sentiment analysis data, specifically mentioning that they benchmark two contrastive methods, POLYJUICE and MiCE. I will need to find out if they specify which datasets were used for sentiment analysis.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **IMDB sentiment analysis dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks and is a well-known benchmark in the field.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IMDB dataset. The citation for the IMDB dataset is as follows:
> Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, 2011.

Since the paper primarily discusses the IMDB dataset and does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the IMDB dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included as required.
