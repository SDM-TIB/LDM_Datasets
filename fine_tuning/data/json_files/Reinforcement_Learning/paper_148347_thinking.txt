To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning through Learning from Demonstrations in Minecraft" by Christian Scheller et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized human demonstrations to improve agent performance, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention a dataset consisting of **over 60 million state-action pairs of human demonstrations**. This is a significant clue that a dataset is being referenced, and I need to find its specific name and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methods or experiments sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the **MineRL dataset** for training their agents. They specifically mention that they used human demonstrations from this dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MineRL dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MineRL Dataset**: 
  > William H. Guss, Brandon Houghton, Nicholay Topin, Phillip Wang, Cayden Codel, Manuela Veloso, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *Minerl: A large-scale dataset of minecraft demonstrations*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-19, pages 2442â€“2448, 2019. doi: 10.24963/ijcai.2019/339.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MineRL Dataset**: This dataset contains over 60 million state-action pairs of human demonstrations solving nine distinct complex tasks in the MineRL environment, specifically for the ObtainDiamond task.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
