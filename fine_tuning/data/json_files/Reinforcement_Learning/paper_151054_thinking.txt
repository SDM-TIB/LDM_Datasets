To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesis of Temporally-Robust Policies for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks using Reinforcement Learning" by Siqi Wang, Shaoyuan Li, and Xiang Yin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments used for testing their algorithms. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets or environments they mention.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments in simulated environments rather than using publicly available datasets. They describe the scenarios and tasks for their experiments, such as a warehouse robot navigating a grid world. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations, as the experiments are based on custom simulations rather than established datasets.

Since there are no formal datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors reference their own simulation environments and tasks without providing external dataset citations. 

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper does not utilize traditional datasets, it describes the experimental setups in detail, which could be useful for replicating the experiments.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, emphasizing the lack of external dataset citations while acknowledging the custom experimental setups described in the paper.
