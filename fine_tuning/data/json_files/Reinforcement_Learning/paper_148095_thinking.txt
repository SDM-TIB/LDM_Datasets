To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Q(σ, λ): A Unified Algorithm with Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning" by Long Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In the abstract, the authors discuss empirical results on "some standard domains," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention conducting extensive experiments on "some standard domains," and they specifically refer to three typical domains for policy evaluation: **Baird Star**, **Boyan Chain**, and **Cart-Pole balancing**. I will note these as they are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets. The paper includes descriptions of the Baird Star and Boyan Chain domains, which provide insights into their structure and characteristics. The Baird Star is described as having seven states and two actions, while the Boyan Chain consists of a chain of 14 states with specific transition probabilities and rewards.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Baird Star**: The dataset is referenced in the context of reinforcement learning and is associated with the work of Baird (1995):
   > Baird, L. 1995. Residual algorithms: Reinforcement learning with function approximation. In Machine Learning Proceedings 1995. 30–37.

2. **Boyan Chain**: This dataset is referenced in the context of temporal difference learning and is associated with the work of Boyan (2002):
   > Boyan, J. A. 2002. Technical update: Least-squares temporal difference learning. Machine learning 49(2-3):233–246.

3. **Cart-Pole balancing**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. A common reference for this task is:
   > Sutton, R. S., and Barto, A. G. 1998. Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT Press.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
