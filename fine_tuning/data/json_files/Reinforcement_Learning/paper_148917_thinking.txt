To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Conditional Random Field-based Attention Mechanism Approach for Gastric Histopathology Image Classification" by Yixin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved a classification specificity of 96.67% on a gastric histopathology dataset with 700 images. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. They mention using a public dataset containing **700 gastric histopathology images stained by H&E**. The dataset includes **140 normal images and 560 abnormal images**, with corresponding ground truth images marked by pathologists.

In **section 4.1.1**, the authors describe the dataset further, noting that the images are in ‘*.tiff’ or ‘*.png’ format and have a size of **2048 × 2048 pixels**. They also explain the staining process and the characteristics of normal versus abnormal images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the gastric histopathology dataset, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Z., & Lin, C. (2018). Pathological Image Classification of Gastric Cancer Based on Depth Learning. *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology*, 45(11A), 263–268.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Gastric Histopathology Dataset**: Contains 700 images (140 normal and 560 abnormal) used for classification tasks in gastric cancer diagnosis.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
