To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skip Vectors for RDF Data: Extraction Based on the Complexity of Feature Patterns" by Yota Minami and Ken Kaneiwa, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on RDF data and mentions evaluation experiments with datasets like Wikidata, DBpedia, and YAGO, which indicates that these are likely the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for evaluation. The paper lists several classification problems along with their respective datasets:

1. **Wikidata**: Used for the Gender1, SeaLake, and NetIncome classification tasks. The paper states that Gender1 consists of 284,464 triples, SeaLake has 177,340 triples, and NetIncome has 104,523 triples.

2. **DBpedia**: Utilized for the ScientistArtist and BoxOffice classification tasks. The ScientistArtist dataset contains 46,822 triples, while the BoxOffice dataset has 64,521 triples.

3. **YAGO**: Used for the Gender2, GDP, and PopulationDensity classification tasks. Gender2 consists of 40,724 triples, GDP has 108,517 triples, and PopulationDensity has 51,748 triples.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can reference the original sources for Wikidata, DBpedia, and YAGO:

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikidata: A free and open knowledge base*. [https://www.wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org).

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:
  > Christian Bizer, Jens Lehmann, Georgi Kobilarov, Sören Auer, Leo Sauermann, and Zhe Wu. *DBpedia - A Crystallization Point for the Linked Data Web*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2007), pages 722–735, 2007.

- For **YAGO**, the citation is:
  > Fabian M. Suchanek, Gjergji Kasneci, and Gerhard Weikum. *YAGO: A Core of Semantic Knowledge*. In Proceedings of the 16th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2007), pages 697–706, 2007.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
