To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Discrete Firefly Algorithm to Solve a Rich Vehicle Routing Problem Modelling a Newspaper Distribution System with Recycling Policy" by Eneko Osaba et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a benchmark composed of 15 instances has been proposed, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the complexity of the newspaper distribution problem and the need for a benchmark, which hints at the existence of a dataset but does not provide specific names yet.

In the **experimentation section**, particularly in **Section 5.1**, the authors describe the benchmark in detail. They mention that the benchmark consists of 15 instances composed of 50 to 100 nodes, representing customers located in real geographical locations in Bizkaia, Spain. This section provides crucial information about the dataset used for the experiments.

The authors also specify the characteristics of the instances in **Table 1**, which summarizes the benchmark. Each instance is named (e.g., "Osaba 50 1 1", "Osaba 50 1 2", etc.) and includes details such as the number of nodes, clusters, vehicle capacity, and forbidden paths. This table is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the benchmark is a new contribution of this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the benchmark is available upon request from the corresponding author or via a specified web link.

The key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Benchmark for AC-VRP-SPDVCFP**: Composed of 15 instances with real geographical locations in Bizkaia, Spain. Each instance has specific characteristics such as the number of nodes, clusters, vehicle capacity, and forbidden paths.

The citation for the paper itself is:

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and the citation for the paper, which serves as the source for the benchmark dataset.
