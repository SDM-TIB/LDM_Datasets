To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Suppressing Overestimation in Q-Learning through Adversarial Behaviors" by HyeAnn Lee and Donghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the methodologies used, including any datasets employed for testing the proposed algorithms. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various benchmark environments for their experiments, such as **Grid World**, **Sutton’s MDP**, and **Weng’s MDP**. I will note these environments as they represent the datasets used for empirical validation of the proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmark environments mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, if the paper references the Grid World environment, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced it. Similarly, I will do the same for Sutton’s MDP and Weng’s MDP.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
