To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GNNUERS: Fairness Explanation in GNNs for Recommendation via Counterfactual Reasoning" by Giacomo Medda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four real-world graphs coming from various domains," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. In this section, they specifically mention using four datasets: 

1. **MovieLens 1M (ML-1M)**: This dataset is widely used in recommendation system research and contains 1 million ratings from users on movies.

2. **Last.FM 1K (LFM-1K)**: This dataset consists of user listening histories and is used for music recommendation tasks.

3. **Insurance (INS)**: This dataset is related to user interactions in the insurance domain, although specific details about its structure are not provided in the text.

4. **Ta Feng (FENG)**: This dataset pertains to grocery shopping interactions, providing insights into consumer behavior in the grocery domain.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MovieLens 1M**, the citation is:

- For **Last.FM 1K**, the citation is:

- For **Insurance (INS)** and **Ta Feng (FENG)**, the paper does not provide specific citations, but they are mentioned as datasets used in the experiments. If they are derived from existing works, I would need to look for those references in the literature or the authors' previous works.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
