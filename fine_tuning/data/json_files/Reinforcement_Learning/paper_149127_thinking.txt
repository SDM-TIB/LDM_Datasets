To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning with Trust Region Methods" by Xiaoteng Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the environments or benchmarks used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets or environments used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments in the **MuJoCo** continuous control environment, which is a well-known physics engine used for reinforcement learning tasks.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 5) for any references to datasets or benchmarks that may have been used in previous studies, as this can provide context for the datasets used in this paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. In this case, the authors refer to the **MuJoCo** environment, which is a widely recognized resource in the reinforcement learning community.

The citation for the MuJoCo environment is:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026–5033, 2012.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset identified.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning.
   - Citation: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026–5033.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
