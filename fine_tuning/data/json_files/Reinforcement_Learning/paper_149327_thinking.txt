To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRANet: Point Cloud Registration with an Artificial Agent" by Lisa Tse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **ModelNet40**, which suggests that this dataset is used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments using the **ModelNet40 dataset**. They describe how they split the official training set into distinct training and validation sets and retained the official test set. This confirms that ModelNet40 is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ModelNet40 dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z.; Song, S.; Khosla, A.; Yu, F.; Zhang, L.; Tang, X.; and Xiao, J. 2014. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Since ModelNet40 is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for ModelNet40, ready for further processing or review.
