To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Exploration for Reinforcement Learning" by Weijun Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments and datasets used for testing their proposed method. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on several environments, specifically:

1. **Chain MDP**: A custom environment designed for testing exploration strategies in reinforcement learning. The authors describe its structure and the challenges it presents.

2. **Atari Games**: The paper states that they tested their method on several hard exploration environments from the Atari suite, including:
   - **Venture**
   - **Montezumaâ€™s Revenge**
   - **Gravitar**
   - **Private Eye**
   - **Solaris**
   - **Freeway**

3. **Super Mario Bros**: Another environment mentioned where the authors tested their method without extrinsic rewards.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The Atari games and Super Mario Bros are well-known datasets, and their citations can be found in the literature. 

For the Atari games, the citation is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Srinivasan, S., Ostrovski, G., Schaul, T., Saxton, D., & Munos, R. (2016). Unifying count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation. In NeurIPS (pp. 1471-1479).

For the Super Mario Bros environment, the citation is:
> Kauten, C. (2018). Super Mario Bros for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/Kautenja/gym-super-mario-bros.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
