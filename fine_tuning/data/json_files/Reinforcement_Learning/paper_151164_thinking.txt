To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A2C: A Modular Multi-stage Collaborative Decision Framework for Human-AI Teams" by Shahroz Tariq et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive simulative experiments using benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they explicitly list four datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification.
2. **FMNIST**: A dataset of fashion items, serving as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
4. **KDDCup99**: A dataset used for network intrusion detection.

The authors provide specific configurations for each dataset, which confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE 86, 11 (1998), 2278–2324.

- For **FMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

- For **KDDCup99**, the citation is:
  > Salvatore Stolfo, Wei Fan, Wenke Lee, Andreas Prodromidis, and Philip Chan. *KDD Cup 1999 Data*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C51C7N.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
