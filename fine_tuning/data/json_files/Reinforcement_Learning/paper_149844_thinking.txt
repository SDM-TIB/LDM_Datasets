To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor UAV" by Beomyeol Yu and Taeyoung Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses prior work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, I will pay close attention to any sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they typically include details about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the abstract or introduction. However, in the **experiments section**, they describe the simulation environment and the reinforcement learning algorithms used, which may imply the use of certain datasets or benchmarks.

I will also check the **references section** for any papers that might have introduced datasets relevant to the study. The authors reference several works that may have utilized datasets, but I need to determine if they are directly using any specific datasets in their experiments.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **OpenAI Gym** as the simulation environment for their experiments. OpenAI Gym is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, and it provides various environments, including those for quadrotor simulations.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: While not a traditional dataset, it serves as a framework that provides environments for reinforcement learning tasks, including quadrotor simulations. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since the paper does not specify any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets or frameworks mentioned.
