To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning with UCB Exploration is Sample Efficient for Infinite-Horizon MDP" by Kefan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for validation and testing of their proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics such as the number of samples, features, or any other pertinent details.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain comprehensive information about each dataset used in the study. This section may also provide insights into how the datasets were collected or processed.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
