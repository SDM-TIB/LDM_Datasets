To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Rigorous Runtime Analysis of the (1 + (λ, λ)) GA on Jump Functions" by Denis Antipov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any benchmarks or datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, the authors discuss the **jump functions benchmark** as the primary focus of their analysis. I will ensure to capture this as it is central to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **jump functions benchmark**, I will note that it is a well-known class of functions used in evolutionary computation, but I will also look for any specific papers or sources that define or describe this benchmark in detail.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset (e.g., Jump Functions).
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset or the source where it can be found.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
