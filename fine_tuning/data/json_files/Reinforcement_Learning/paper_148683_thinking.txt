To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EPIDEMIOPTIM: A Toolbox for the Optimization of Control Policies in Epidemiological Models" by Cédric Colas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets or models used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the tools, models, and datasets they used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention the use of an **extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model** fitted to French data from Prague et al. (2020). This indicates that the SEIR model is based on a specific dataset, which I need to identify.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings or provide any additional details about the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the SEIR model is based on the work by Prague et al. (2020), which I will need to cite correctly.

The citation for the SEIR model is:
> Mélanie Prague, Linda Wittkop, Quentin Clairon, Dan Dutartre, Rodolphe Thiébaut, and Boris Pierre Hejblum. *Population modeling of early COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in French regions and estimation of the lockdown impact on infection rate*. medRxiv, 2020.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
