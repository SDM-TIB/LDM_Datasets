To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Fuzzing" by Konstantin BÃ¶ttinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets that were utilized for testing the proposed methods. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **PDF files** as the target programs for their fuzzing experiments. However, they do not specify a particular dataset of PDF files. Instead, they describe the structure of PDF documents and the types of mutations applied to them. I will note that while there is no formal dataset citation, the authors refer to a **PDF specification** as a foundational document for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct references, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets or tools used in their experiments. The paper cites the **PDF Reference** as a key resource, which provides the necessary background on the PDF format.

The relevant citation for the PDF specification is:
> PDF Reference, 6th ed., Adobe Systems Incorporated, Nov. 2006, available at http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf.

Since the authors do not provide a specific dataset name but refer to the PDF format and its specification, I will document this as the primary reference for the dataset context.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PDF specification as it serves as the basis for the dataset used in the experiments.
