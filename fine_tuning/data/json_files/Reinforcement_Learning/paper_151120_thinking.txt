To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactuals in factor models" by Jad Beyhum, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical application sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and empirical application sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the methodology and its applications but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **empirical application section** where the author revisits the work of Voigtländer (2014) and mentions a dataset used for analysis.

The paper states that it uses the dataset from Yin et al. (2021), which is a balanced version of the original data from Voigtländer (2014). The author provides a link to the dataset, indicating its relevance to the study.

Next, I will extract the details of the dataset mentioned:

1. **Dataset from Yin et al. (2021)**: This dataset corresponds to a panel data with N = 313 sectors of the U.S. economy observed yearly from 1958 to 2005. It is used to analyze the effect of skill intensity on wage inequality.

Now, I will look up the full citation for the dataset referenced from Yin et al. (2021). The citation is as follows:

- For the dataset from Yin et al. (2021):
  > Yin, S.-y., Liu, C.-a., & Lin, C.-C. (2021). Focused information criterion and model averaging for large panels with a multifactor error structure. *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, 39(1), 54–68. DOI: 10.1080/07350015.2021.1871234.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified one dataset used in the paper, and I will document it along with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
