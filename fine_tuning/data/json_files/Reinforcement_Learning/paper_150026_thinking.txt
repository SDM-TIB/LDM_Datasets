To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial Counterfactual Identification for Infinite Horizon Partially Observable Markov Decision Process" by Aditya Kelvianto Sidharta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an algorithm but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets used for validation or testing are described. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the author does not explicitly mention any datasets in the experiments section. However, I will check if there are any references to datasets in the **methodology** or **preliminaries** sections, as sometimes datasets are described in the context of the methods used.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. If the author refers to datasets used in previous studies, I will note those references as well.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if a dataset is mentioned as being used in a previous study, I will look up that study to get the complete citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

If no datasets are found, I will note that the paper does not provide any datasets for use in experiments or validation.
