To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model" by Julian Schrittwieser et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the MuZero algorithm on **57 different Atari games**, which suggests that there is a dataset related to these games.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. In the **results section**, the authors discuss performance across various games, indicating that the **Atari Learning Environment** is used as a benchmark. This is a strong indication that the dataset is related to the Atari games.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The Atari Learning Environment is referenced as:
- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of classic board games like **Go, Chess, and Shogi**. I will look for their respective datasets as well. The citations for these games are typically found in the references section, and I will ensure to include them.

For **Go**, the citation is:
- **AlphaGo**:
  > David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris J. Maddison, Arthur Guez, Laurent Sifre, George van den Driessche, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis Antonoglou, Veda Panneershelvam, Marc Lanctot, Sander Dieleman, Dominik Grewe, John Nham, Nal Kalchbrenner, Ilya Sutskever, Timothy Lillicrap, Madeleine Leach, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Thore Graepel, and Demis Hassabis. *Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search*. Nature, 529(7587):484–489, January 2016.

For **Chess**, the citation is:
- **AlphaZero**:
  > David Silver, Thomas Hubert, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis Antonoglou, Matthew Lai, Arthur Guez, Marc Lanctot, Laurent Sifre, Dharshan Kumaran, Thore Graepel, et al. *A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and go through self-play*. Science, 362(6419):1140–1144, 2018.

For **Shogi**, the citation is included in the same paper as Chess.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: A dataset consisting of 57 different Atari games used for evaluating the MuZero algorithm.
   - Citation: Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

2. **AlphaGo Dataset**: Used for evaluating the performance of the MuZero algorithm in the game of Go.
   - Citation: David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris J. Maddison, Arthur Guez, Laurent Sifre, George van den Driessche, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis Antonoglou, Veda Panneershelvam, Marc Lanctot, Sander Dieleman, Dominik Grewe, John Nham, Nal Kalchbrenner, Ilya Sutskever, Timothy Lillicrap, Madeleine Leach, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Thore Graepel, and Demis Hassabis. *Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search*. Nature, 529(7587):484–489, January 2016.

3. **AlphaZero Dataset**: Used for evaluating the performance of the MuZero algorithm in Chess and Shogi.
   - Citation: David Silver, Thomas Hubert, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis Antonoglou, Matthew Lai, Arthur Guez, Marc Lanctot, Laurent Sifre, Dharshan Kumaran, Thore Graepel, et al. *A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and go through self-play*. Science, 362(6419):1140–1144, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured properly for any further processing or review.
