To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Triggers for Watermarking of Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies" by Vahid Behzadan and William H. Hsu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses watermarking a DQN policy trained in the Cartpole environment, which suggests that the Cartpole environment may be a dataset or at least a benchmark used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiment setup section** (Section 4) closely, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets or environments used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention that they evaluate their watermarking scheme in the **CartPole environment**. This environment is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, but I need to confirm if it is treated as a dataset in this context.

In the **experiment setup**, the authors provide specifications for the CartPole environment, including the state space and action space. However, they do not mention any additional datasets beyond the CartPole environment. Therefore, I will focus on documenting the CartPole environment as the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CartPole environment. The CartPole environment is part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is as follows:

- For **CartPole environment**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., & Tang, J. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets or environments, I will compile the information regarding the CartPole environment into a structured format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CartPole environment, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
