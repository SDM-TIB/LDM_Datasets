To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Teammates for Training Robust Ad Hoc Teamwork Agents via Best-Response Diversity" by Arrasy Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in various environments, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. This section is likely to provide details about the datasets or environments that were utilized.

In **section 6.1 (Environments)**, the authors describe three environments used for their experiments: **Cooperative Reaching**, **Level-Based Foraging**, and **Simple Cooking**. Each environment is detailed, including its structure and the tasks involved, but I need to confirm if these environments are based on existing datasets or if they are newly created.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited that correspond to the environments mentioned. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the environments are based on existing frameworks and methodologies rather than traditional datasets. However, I will still document the environments as they serve as the basis for the experiments conducted in the paper.

1. **Cooperative Reaching**: This environment is a grid world where agents must reach specific coordinates to receive rewards. It is based on the framework established by previous works in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

2. **Level-Based Foraging (LBF)**: This environment involves agents collecting objects scattered in a grid world, requiring collaboration. It is also based on established methodologies in the field.

3. **Simple Cooking**: This environment simulates a cooking task where agents must collaborate to prepare a dish. It draws inspiration from existing cooperative task frameworks.

Since these environments are not traditional datasets but rather experimental setups, I will note that they are based on established methodologies in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Finally, I will compile the information about these environments and their references into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any foundational works referenced in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the information in a structured manner.
