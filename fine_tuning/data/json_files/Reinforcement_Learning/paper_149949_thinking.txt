To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering novel systemic biomarkers in photos of the external eye" by Boris Babenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study developed a deep learning system using images from patients, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **Datasets subsection**, where the authors describe the data sources used for developing and evaluating their deep learning system. Here, they mention three specific sources:

1. **EyePACS/LACDHS dataset**: This dataset includes data from clinics in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, comprising 61,230 patients.
2. **Technology-based Eye Care Services (TECS) dataset**: This dataset consists of data from primary care clinics in the greater Atlanta area, involving 10,402 patients.
3. **VA TECS dataset**: This dataset includes data from community-based outpatient clinics in the Atlanta VA Healthcare system, with 6,266 patients.

In addition to identifying the datasets, I will also look for any specific details about the datasets, such as the number of images, patient demographics, and any relevant characteristics that might be useful for understanding the context of the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors may reference the original sources of these datasets or provide additional context that can help in constructing the citations.

For example, if the EyePACS dataset is referenced in another paper, I will include that citation. If the datasets are proprietary or not publicly available, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and ready for further analysis or use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
