To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning in Competitive Network with Haeussler's Equation" by N. Joshi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses competitive learning and neural networks but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will focus on the **results section** where the author discusses the application of the FIREFLY algorithm and mentions using a dataset of handwritten digits as a real-world example. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved in the research.

In the **discussion section**, the author elaborates on the use of the handwritten digits dataset, stating that it is available on the internet for standard cases. However, the paper does not provide a specific name for this dataset or a citation.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will look for the most commonly used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, which is the **MNIST dataset**. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized in the machine learning community for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Handwritten Digits Dataset**: The paper refers to a dataset of handwritten digits used for training the network. While the paper does not explicitly name it, it is reasonable to assume that it refers to the MNIST dataset, which is a standard dataset for this type of task.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the MNIST dataset from the literature:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for the handwritten digits dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation for proper documentation.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
