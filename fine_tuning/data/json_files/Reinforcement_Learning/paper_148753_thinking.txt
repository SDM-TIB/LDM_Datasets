To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Process Optimization" by Elton Pana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case studies sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the data used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying reinforcement learning (RL) in industrial settings, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **methodology** section, where they outline their approach and may reference datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will examine the **case studies** section, as this is where the authors often provide detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized. In this paper, the authors present two case studies:

1. **Case Study 1**: This case study involves the photoproduction of phycocyanin synthesized by cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis. The authors reference a model from a previous study (Bradford et al., 2020) that describes the system dynamics. However, they do not explicitly mention a dataset name; instead, they describe the parameters and constraints used in the simulation.

2. **Case Study 2**: This case study involves a semi-batch reactor with specific chemical reactions. Similar to Case Study 1, the authors reference a model from a previous study (Bradford et al., 2018) but do not provide a specific dataset name.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might contain datasets relevant to the case studies. The references to Bradford et al. (2020) and Bradford et al. (2018) are crucial, as they may provide datasets or models that the authors used in their experiments.

The full citations for these references are:

- For the model used in Case Study 1:
  > E. Bradford, L. Imsland, D. Zhang, E. A. del Rio Chanona. *Stochastic data-driven model predictive control using gaussian processes*. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 139, 106844, 2020.

- For the model used in Case Study 2:
  > E. Bradford, L. Imsland. *Economic stochastic model predictive control using the unscented kalman filter*. IFAC-PapersOnLine, 51(18), 417â€“422, 2018.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, including the references to the models used in the case studies, into a structured format for further processing or review.
