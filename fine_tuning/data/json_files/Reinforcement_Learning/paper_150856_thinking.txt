To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA: Adjusted common average referencing for cortico-cortical evoked potential data" by Harvey Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an algorithm (CARLA) tested on both simulated and real CCEP data, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly focusing on the subsections that describe the data collection and simulation processes. Here, the authors mention that CARLA was tested on simulated CCEP data and real CCEP data collected from four human participants. This suggests that there are two types of datasets to extract: simulated data and real data from human subjects.

In the **2.4 (Construction of simulated CCEP data)** subsection, the authors detail how they created simulated CCEP data, specifying that they generated data with 50 channels and 12 trials at various levels of responsiveness. This section provides a clear description of the simulated dataset.

In the **2.5 (Collection and preprocessing of real CCEP data)** subsection, the authors describe the real CCEP data collected from four human subjects, including details about the number of measurement electrodes and stimulation sites for each subject. This information is crucial for documenting the real dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **Simulated CCEP Data**: The authors created simulated CCEP data with 50 channels and 12 trials, varying the number of channels containing true responses from 0 to 45. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the CARLA algorithm.

2. **Real CCEP Data**: The real CCEP data were collected from four human subjects (two male and two female), with specific details about the number of measurement electrodes and stimulation sites for each subject. This dataset is used to validate the CARLA algorithm.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the simulated dataset is generated by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will focus on the real dataset.

The real CCEP data is referenced in the context of the study, but it does not have a specific citation like a published dataset. Instead, I will note that the data is available in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format upon manuscript publication, as mentioned in the **2.8 (Data and code availability)** subsection.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

- **Simulated CCEP Data**: Generated by the authors for testing the CARLA algorithm, consisting of 50 channels and 12 trials with varying responsiveness levels. No formal citation as it is a generated dataset.

- **Real CCEP Data**: Collected from four human subjects, with specific details on the number of electrodes and stimulation sites. The data will be available in BIDS format upon publication.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into the required output structure for review or further processing.
