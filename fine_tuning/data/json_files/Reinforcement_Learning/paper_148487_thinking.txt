To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human and Multi-Agent Collaboration in a Human-MARL Teaming Framework" by Neda Navidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets or experimental setups that might involve data collection. The abstract discusses the development of an open-source MARL framework called COGMENT, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or any specific environments that might imply the use of datasets. The introduction discusses the need for scalable simulation platforms but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then examine **section 4 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (COGMENT)**, where the authors describe the framework and its components. This section may provide insights into the types of data collected or used within the framework. However, it primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of COGMENT without detailing specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **conclusion** section to see if the authors summarize any datasets or data sources used in their experiments. The conclusion mentions the simplification of conducting large-scale experiments but does not specify any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to identify any cited works that may include datasets or frameworks that are relevant to the study. I will look for papers that might have introduced datasets or methodologies that the authors of this paper have built upon.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that in my output. If I find any relevant datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations as follows:

- For example, if the authors referenced a dataset from a previous study, I would include the citation in the format:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. Journal/Conference, Year.

If I find no datasets mentioned, I will document that the paper does not provide specific datasets for review. 

In summary, my approach involves a careful reading of the abstract, introduction, methods, conclusion, and references to extract any datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset identified.
