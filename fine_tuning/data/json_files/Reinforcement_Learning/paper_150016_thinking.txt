To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniformly Sampled Polar and Cylindrical Grid Approach for 2D, 3D Image Reconstruction using Algebraic Algorithm" by Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "experimental projections data of a frog and Cu-Lump," indicating that these are the datasets used for validation.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **results section**. The authors describe the datasets used for reconstruction, specifically mentioning the "Copper lump" and "frog specimens." They provide parameters related to the data collection and reconstruction for these specimens, which will help in detailing the datasets.

In the **results section**, I will find the following information:

1. **Copper Lump Dataset**: 
   - Source coordinate: (-8.2, 0, 0)
   - Center coordinate of detector system: (38.4, 0, 0)
   - Reconstruction image grid size: (128 × 128 × 128)
   - Grid spacing: 0.03125
   - Number of lines in each projection: 101 × 101
   - Number of projections: 50
   - Relaxation value: 0.4

2. **Frog Dataset**:
   - Source coordinate: (-22.5, 0, 0)
   - Center coordinate of detector system: (24.1, 0, 0)
   - Reconstruction image grid size: (256 × 256 × 256)
   - Grid spacing: 0.0078
   - Number of lines in each projection: 201 × 201
   - Number of projections: 70
   - Relaxation value: 0.4

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. The paper mentions that the projection data for the frog and Cu-lump were generated using a Procron X-ray CT mini machine, which is referenced in the paper.

The citation for the Procron X-ray CT mini machine is:
> "Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur Procon X-ray CT mini," [Online]. Available: https://www.iitk.ac.in/net/data/CT-MINI_Dec_18.pdf. [Accessed 23 September 2020].

Since the datasets are derived from experimental data collected using this machine, I will use this citation for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited for future reference.
