To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sum Throughput Maximization in Multi-BD Symbiotic Radio NOMA Network Assisted by Active-STAR-RIS" by Rahman Saadat Yeganeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical for their research. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Then, I will examine the **methodology section** to identify if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the study.

After that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This may provide additional insights into how the datasets were used and their significance in the research.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them with their full citations. For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references and note it down.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, to ensure a comprehensive extraction of the datasets used in the paper.
