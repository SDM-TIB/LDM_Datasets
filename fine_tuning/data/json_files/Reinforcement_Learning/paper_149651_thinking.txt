To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast-R2D2: A Pretrained Recursive Neural Network based on Pruned CKY for Grammar Induction and Text Representation" by Xiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of grammar induction and mention that they pretrain their model on a large corpus. However, they do not specify the datasets in this section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that they pretrain Fast-R2D2 on **WikiText103** and fine-tune it on the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**. This is a crucial finding, as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **WikiText103**, the citation is:
   > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017, Conference Track Proceedings. OpenReview.net.

2. For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
   > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
