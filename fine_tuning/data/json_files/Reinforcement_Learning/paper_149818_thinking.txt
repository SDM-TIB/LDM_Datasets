To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Donâ€™t Explain Noise: Robust Counterfactuals for Randomized Ensembles" by Alexandre Forel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of counterfactual explanations and mentions the evaluation of methods on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **Section 5 (Experimental Results)**. Here, they mention several datasets used for evaluating their methods. I will extract the names and descriptions of these datasets from this section.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for assessing the fairness of risk assessments in criminal justice. It contains features related to individuals' criminal history and demographic information.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is used for credit scoring and contains various features related to individuals' financial history and demographic information.

3. **Credit Card Default Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict defaults on credit card payments and includes features related to individuals' financial behavior.

4. **Online News Popularity Dataset**: This dataset contains features related to online articles and their popularity metrics.

5. **Phishing Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting phishing websites and includes various features related to website characteristics.

6. **Spambase Dataset**: This dataset is used for spam detection and contains features extracted from emails.

7. **Students Performance Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze students' performance based on various demographic and educational features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
