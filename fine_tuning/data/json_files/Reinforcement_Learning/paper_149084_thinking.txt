To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Conversational Dense Retrieval" by Shi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **TREC CAsT and OR-QuAC**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of conversational search and mention the datasets used for evaluation. This section often provides context about the datasets and their significance in the research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. The authors typically provide descriptions, statistics, and the specific roles of each dataset in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **TREC CAsT 2019**: This dataset includes a series of dialogues for conversational search, with specific statistics about the number of conversations, questions, and relevance judgments.

2. **TREC CAsT 2020**: Similar to the 2019 dataset, this dataset builds on the previous year's work and includes additional dialogues and relevance judgments.

3. **OR-QuAC**: This is a large-scale synthetic conversational retrieval dataset built on the QuAC dataset, which involves multi-turn questions about Wikipedia entities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **TREC CAsT 2019**:
  > Jeffrey Dalton, Chenyan Xiong, and Jamie Callan. 2019. TREC CAsT 2019: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview. In Proceedings of TREC.

- For **TREC CAsT 2020**:
  > Jeffrey Dalton, Chenyan Xiong, and Jamie Callan. 2020. CAsT 2020: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview. In Proceedings of TREC.

- For **OR-QuAC**:
  > Chen Qu, Liu Yang, Cen Chen, Minghui Qiu, W. Bruce Croft, and Mohit Iyyer. 2020. Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering. In Proceedings of SIGIR.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
