To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Don’t Touch What Matters: Task-Aware Lipschitz Data Augmentation for Visual Reinforcement Learning" by Zhecheng Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation on three benchmarks: **DeepMind Control Suite**, **CARLA**, and **DeepMind Manipulation tasks**. I will check if these benchmarks are associated with specific datasets or if they reference any original dataset papers.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC-GB)**: This is a popular benchmark modified from the DMControl suite, which is referenced in the paper. I will look for the original citation for this dataset.

2. **CARLA**: The authors mention using the CARLA simulator for autonomous driving tasks. I will find the citation for the CARLA dataset.

3. **DeepMind Manipulation Tasks**: This dataset is used for robot manipulation tasks. I will also look for the original citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *dm control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6:100022, 2020.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1–16. PMLR, 2017.

- For **DeepMind Manipulation Tasks**, the citation is:
  > Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *dm control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6:100022, 2020. (Note: This is the same citation as for the DeepMind Control Suite, as they are related.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
