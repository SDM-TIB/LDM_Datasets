To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Search by Target Distribution Learning for Continuous Control" by Chuheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted in the **MuJoCo environment**, which suggests that datasets related to this environment may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on continuous control tasks using the **OpenAI Gym** and **MuJoCo** simulators. I will note any specific datasets or benchmarks that are referenced.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any unique datasets but refer to the **MuJoCo** environment and **OpenAI Gym** as the platforms used for their experiments. Therefore, I will need to provide citations for these platforms as they serve as the datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these platforms:

1. **MuJoCo**:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A Physics Engine for Model-based Control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026â€“5033). IEEE.

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets used in the experiments:

- **MuJoCo**: A physics engine used for model-based control tasks, providing a variety of continuous control benchmarks.
- **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which includes various environments for testing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
