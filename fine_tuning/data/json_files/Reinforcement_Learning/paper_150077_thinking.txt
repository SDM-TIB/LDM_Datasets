To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Shaping for User Satisfaction in a REINFORCE Recommender" by Konstantina Christakopoulou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of surveys to measure user satisfaction, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to user survey responses.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Imputing Satisfaction in Reward)**, as it appears to focus on the methodology for incorporating satisfaction signals into the reward system. Here, the authors mention using survey data to assess user satisfaction, indicating that there is a dataset of survey responses involved.

In **section 6 (Live Experiments)**, the authors describe conducting A/B experiments on a large-scale recommendation platform. They mention the collection of survey responses to evaluate user satisfaction, which reinforces the presence of a dataset related to user feedback.

Now, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **References section**. The authors cite several works that may provide context or data sources for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name a specific dataset in the references.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **User Satisfaction Survey Dataset**: This dataset consists of user responses to satisfaction surveys, where users rate their satisfaction with items they have interacted with on a scale from 1 to 5. The authors mention that the response rate is around 2%, indicating the dataset is sparse.

The citation for the survey methodology is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is implied that the dataset is derived from user interactions on a commercial recommendation platform.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset is based on internal data collected from the authors' experiments on a recommendation platform.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the relevant citations and descriptions for each dataset.
