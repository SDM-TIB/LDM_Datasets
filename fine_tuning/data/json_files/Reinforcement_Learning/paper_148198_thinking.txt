To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Observables for continuous control of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm via Reinforcement Learning" by Artur Garcia-Saez and Jordi Riu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of a classical control mechanism for Quantum devices, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section II (The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm as a Quantum Environment)** and **section III (Reinforcement Learning in a Continuous Action Space)** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. These sections focus on the methodology and theoretical framework, but they may also contain information about the datasets used for testing.

In **section IV (Results)**, the authors present results from simulations of a classical-Quantum system running the Q-learning algorithm. They mention running tests on **MAXCUT instances of size up to N = 21**. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name; instead, they describe the problem being solved (MAXCUT) and the parameters used.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or benchmarks relevant to the MAXCUT problem or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers related to the QAOA and MAXCUT problem, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation. The references include foundational papers on QAOA and its applications, which may imply the use of standard datasets in the field, but they do not specify any datasets directly.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will note that the MAXCUT problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, and datasets for this problem can be found in the literature, but they are not specified in this particular paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **MAXCUT Instances**: The paper discusses running tests on MAXCUT instances of size up to N = 21, but does not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as initially intended. Instead, I will note the absence of specific dataset references in my final output.
