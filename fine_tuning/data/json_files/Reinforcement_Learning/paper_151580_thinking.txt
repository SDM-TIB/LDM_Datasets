To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The State-Action-Reward-State-Action Algorithm in Spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma Game" by Lanyu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, models and methods, simulation and analysis, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical framework and the significance of cooperative behavior in evolutionary game theory, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **models and methods** section, where they describe the SARSA algorithm and its application in the context of the prisoner’s dilemma. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, in the **simulation and analysis** section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the parameters used for the SARSA algorithm and the lattice structure for agents. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Instead, they refer to the methodology based on previous research, which may indicate reliance on existing datasets rather than new ones.

I will also check the **conclusion** to see if the authors summarize any datasets or data sources they utilized. However, it appears that the paper primarily focuses on the algorithm and its implications rather than on specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references** section to identify any studies or datasets that may have been used indirectly. The references include various foundational works in evolutionary game theory and reinforcement learning, but they do not point to specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it seems that there are no distinct datasets provided or referenced that can be extracted for citation. The authors primarily focus on the theoretical aspects and the application of the SARSA algorithm without relying on specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the SARSA algorithm and its implications for cooperation in evolutionary games, it does not provide explicit datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries as there are none to extract from this paper.
