To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Is attention to bounding boxes all you need for pedestrian action prediction?" by Lina Achaji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **PIE dataset** and introduced a new dataset called **CP2A**. This gives me a starting point for further investigation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for additional context about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of predicting pedestrian behavior and mentions the PIE dataset as a benchmark for evaluating pedestrian action prediction. This reinforces the significance of the PIE dataset in their research.

Then, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on the parts where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In the **experiments section**, they provide a description of both datasets:

1. **Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) dataset**: This dataset contains 6 hours of footage recorded at 30 frames per second, capturing various pedestrian behaviors near crossing events. It includes bounding box coordinates and critical crossing times for pedestrians.

2. **CARLA Pedestrian Action Anticipation (CP2A) dataset**: This is a simulated dataset generated using the CARLA simulator, containing nearly 55,000 simulated pedestrians and approximately 14 million bounding box samples. The dataset is designed for action prediction and includes sequences of pedestrian behavior.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **PIE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Rasouli, Iuliia Kotseruba, Toni Kunic, and John K Tsotsos. *PIE: A large-scale dataset and models for pedestrian intention estimation and trajectory prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 6262â€“6271, 2019.

- For the **CP2A dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Lina Achaji, Julien Moreau, Thibault Fouqueray, Francois Aioun, and Francois Charpillet. *Is attention to bounding boxes all you need for pedestrian action prediction?* In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2022.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
