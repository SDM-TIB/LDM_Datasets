To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Non-myopic Power Allocation in Constrained Scenarios" by Arindam Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of power allocation but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, the authors mention that they set the wireless network size \( M = 10 \), spatial size \( S = 60 \) units, and transmitter range \( R = 20 \) units for all experiments. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or specific datasets used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. The references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments; instead, they constructed their own simulated environments based on defined parameters. Therefore, there are no datasets to extract or cite.

In conclusion, I will document that there are no datasets mentioned in this paper, and thus no citations are necessary. If I were to summarize this finding, I would note that the authors conducted experiments using a simulated wireless network environment rather than relying on external datasets.
