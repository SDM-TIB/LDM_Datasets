To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN" by Ian Osband et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Arcade Learning Environment)**, where the authors evaluate their algorithm across 49 Atari games. This section is likely to contain specific mentions of the datasets used for training and testing their model. 

In this section, the authors refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment** as the primary dataset for their experiments. They mention that they evaluate their algorithm on 49 Atari games, which are part of this environment. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.4708, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the Arcade Learning Environment, I will compile this information.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset entry correctly, including the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: A platform for evaluating general agents across various Atari games.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.4708, 2012.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
