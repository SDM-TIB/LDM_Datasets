To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rollout Heuristics for Online Stochastic Contingent Planning" by Oded Blumenthal and Guy Shani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for empirical evaluation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several benchmark domains for their empirical evaluation, such as **Doors**, **Blocks World**, **Unix**, **MedPks**, **Localize**, and **Wumpus**. I will note these domains as they may correspond to datasets or specific problem instances used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmark problems mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to document them with their full citations. If the datasets are derived from existing literature, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
