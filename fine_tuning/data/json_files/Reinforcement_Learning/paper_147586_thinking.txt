To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QLBS: Q-Learner in the Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds" by Igor Halperin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned explicitly. The abstract discusses a model for option pricing using reinforcement learning, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the application of reinforcement learning in finance, but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed model. In the methodology section, the author discusses the use of historical trading data and mentions that the model can be applied to both real data and data generated from known models. However, no specific datasets are named.

I will also check the **numerical experiments** section, where the author might provide examples of datasets used in simulations or experiments. The author mentions that the model can be implemented using historical datasets of stock prices and hedge positions, but does not provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning, option pricing, and financial modeling, but they do not specifically cite datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the author discusses the use of historical trading data and mentions the potential for using datasets from the OpenAI Gym platform, no specific datasets are explicitly named or cited in the paper.

Since I did not find any specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Historical Trading Data**: The paper discusses the use of historical trading data for training the QLBS model but does not provide a specific dataset name or citation.
2. **OpenAI Gym**: The author mentions that similar environments are available in the OpenAI Gym, which could be used for reinforcement learning experiments, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning in finance and the use of historical data, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for them. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned in the text.
