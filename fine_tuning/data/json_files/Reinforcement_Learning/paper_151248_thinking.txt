To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Changed? Converting Representational Interventions to Natural Language" by Matan Avitan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments or referenced in the context of the research. The authors discuss various intervention techniques and their implications, which may lead to the identification of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. Here, they explicitly mention the **BiasBios dataset** as the primary dataset for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the specific annotations it contains.

The paper states that the BiasBios dataset is a large collection of short biographies annotated with gender and profession. This is crucial information that I will include in my dataset description.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BiasBios dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Maria De-Arteaga, Alexey Romanov, Hanna Wallach, Jennifer Chayes, Christian Borgs, Alexandra Chouldechova, Sahin Geyik, Krishnaram Kenthapadi, and Adam Tauman Kalai. 2019. Bias in bios: A case study of semantic representation bias in a high-stakes setting. In proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pages 120â€“128.

Now that I have the dataset name, its description, and the full citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review, making sure to emphasize the importance of including the full citation for proper attribution.
