To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resource Allocation in Mobility-Aware Federated Learning Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Huy T. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning and may reference existing datasets used in related works. I will look for any specific datasets that are cited or described.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CIFAR-10" or "MNIST," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examine the methodology and experiments sections for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations for each one.
