To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Sampling on Temporal Medical Imaging Sequences" by Zhishen Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any context or background that might mention datasets relevant to the study. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may highlight key datasets that are foundational to the work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the author explicitly mentions the dataset used for testing the reinforcement learning sampling schemes. Here, the paper states that they tested their methods on the **OCMR dataset**, which is described as an open cardiovascular MRI dataset containing multiple cardiac cine series. The details provided include the number of series used for training and testing, as well as the dimensions of the frames.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OCMR dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **OCMR dataset**:
  > Chong Chen, Yingmin Liu, Philip Schniter, Matthew Tong, Karolina Zareba, Orlando Simonetti, Lee Potter, and Rizwan Ahmad. *OCMR (v1.0)â€“open-access multi-coil k-space dataset for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging*, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OCMR dataset as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
