To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rescuing referral failures during automated diagnosis of domain-shifted medical images" by Anuj Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors examine two benchmark diagnostic medical imaging datasets related to diabetic retinopathy and chest X-ray images. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **EyePACS Dataset**: This is the in-domain dataset for diabetic retinopathy, containing 35,126 training images, 10,906 validation images, and 42,670 test images. The dataset is used for binary classification based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

2. **APTOS Dataset**: This is the out-of-domain dataset for diabetic retinopathy, containing 733 training images and 2,929 test images. It follows the same labeling conventions as EyePACS.

3. **CheXpert Dataset**: This is the in-domain dataset for chest X-ray images, with 191,027 training images, 202 validation images, and 518 test images. It is annotated based on 14 radiological findings.

4. **ChestX-ray14 Dataset**: This is the out-of-domain dataset for chest X-ray images, containing 89,795 training images and 22,325 test images. It also follows the same labeling conventions as CheXpert.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
