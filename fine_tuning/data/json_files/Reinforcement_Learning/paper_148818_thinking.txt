To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Gradient RL Algorithms as Directed Acyclic Graphs" by Juan Jose Garau Luis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors test their approach using a set of training environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide specific names or descriptions of the datasets. They mention using environments from OpenAI Gym and MiniGrid, which are likely to be the datasets of interest.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsections discussing the training environments, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. The authors state they use "4 classical control tasks from OpenAI Gym" and "12 multitask gridworld style environments from MiniGrid." This gives me the names of the datasets used for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

2. For the **MiniGrid**, the citation is:
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to document them clearly, emphasizing the importance of including full citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
