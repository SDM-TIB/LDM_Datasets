To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Discovers Internal Models" by Nir Baram, Tom Zahavy, and Shie Mannor, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of the Semi-Aggregated MDP (SAMDP) model but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation setup. Here, they mention evaluating their method on three Atari2600 games: **Breakout, Pacman, and Seaquest**. This indicates that these games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **setup subsection** within the experiments section for more details about how the data was collected. The authors state that they collected **120,000 game states** for each game, represented by **512 features**. This information is crucial for understanding the nature of the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets used. However, since the datasets are based on well-known Atari games, I will provide the citations for the original sources of these games:

1. **Breakout**: 
   > Atari, Inc. *Breakout*. 1976. [Available at: https://atari.com]

2. **Pacman**: 
   > Namco. *Pac-Man*. 1980. [Available at: https://www.namco.com]

3. **Seaquest**: 
   > Atari, Inc. *Seaquest*. 1983. [Available at: https://atari.com]

Since these games are classic titles, they do not have formal academic citations like datasets typically do, but I will note their original release information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant information from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
