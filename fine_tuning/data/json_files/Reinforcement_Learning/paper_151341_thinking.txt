To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-compatible driving partners through data-regularized self-play reinforcement learning" by Daphne Cornelisse and Eugene Vinitsky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a dataset from the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for realistic human agents and refer to the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset** as a source for their expert demonstrations. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **methods section**, particularly under **Expert demonstrations**, the authors describe how they obtain a dataset of observation-action pairs from the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**. They mention that the dataset consists of data collected from K = 200 scenarios with T = 90 time steps, which is equivalent to 30 minutes of driving data. This provides me with the necessary details about the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset** in their evaluations. The authors mention that they partition 10,200 randomly chosen traffic scenarios into training and testing sets, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Scott Ettinger, Shuyang Cheng, Benjamin Caine, Chenxi Liu, Hang Zhao, Sabeek Pradhan, Yuning Chai, Ben Sapp, Charles R Qi, Yin Zhou, et al. *Large scale interactive motion forecasting for autonomous driving: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 9710â€“9719, 2021.

After compiling this information, I will create an entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Confirm dataset details in the methods section.
3. Verify dataset usage in the experiments section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

With this structured approach, I can ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
