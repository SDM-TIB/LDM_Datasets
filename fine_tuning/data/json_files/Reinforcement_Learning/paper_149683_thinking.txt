To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse Counterfactual Explanations for Anomaly Detection in Time Series," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate their method on "univariate and multivariate real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list four benchmark datasets used for evaluation:

1. **KPI Dataset**: This dataset contains 29 univariate time series from the AIOPS data competition, consisting of Key Performance Indicator curves from different internet companies at 1-minute intervals.

2. **YAHOO Dataset**: Published by Yahoo Labs, this dataset consists of 367 real and synthetic univariate time series.

3. **Server Machine Dataset (SMD)**: This dataset contains 28 time series with 38 dimensions, collected from a machine in large internet companies.

4. **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Dataset**: This NASA dataset contains 55 time series with 25 dimensions, published by Hundman et al. (2018).

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to confirm their usage in the study. The authors clearly state that they used these datasets for evaluating their method, which solidifies their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **KPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > KPI Anomaly Detection. *AIOPS Data Competition*. Available at: https://github.com/NetManAIOps/KPI-Anomaly-Detection.

- For the **YAHOO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Labs. *Yahoo Webscope Dataset*. Available at: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70.

- For the **Server Machine Dataset (SMD)**, the citation is:
  > Su, Y., Zhao, Y., Niu, C., Liu, R., Sun, W., & Pei, D. (2019). *Robust Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series through Stochastic Recurrent Neural Network*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining.

- For the **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hundman, K., et al. (2018). *Detecting Spacecraft Anomalies Using LSTMs and Nonparametric Dynamic Thresholding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
