To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perovskite PV-powered RFID: enabling low-cost self-powered IoT sensors" by Sai Nithin R. Kantareddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a perovskite-powered wireless temperature sensor, which may imply the use of specific datasets for performance evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** to identify any datasets used for testing or validation. I will look for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that provide empirical data supporting the claims made in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors mention the performance of the perovskite PV-RFID sensor, including its communication range and power consumption. If they refer to any specific datasets or experimental data, I will note those down.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or studies that may provide additional context or data. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for any datasets mentioned.

If the paper includes any supplementary materials or appendices, I will review those as well, as they may contain additional datasets or experimental results that are relevant.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. If the paper mentions a dataset related to the performance of the perovskite PV cells, I will look for the original source of that dataset and provide the citation.
2. If the authors reference any previous studies or datasets, I will extract the full citation from the references section.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or citations in the paper.
