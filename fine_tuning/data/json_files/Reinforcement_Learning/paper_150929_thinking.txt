To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Intelligent Traffic Signal Controls with Optimized CO2 emissions" by Pedram Agand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of traffic signal control and mentions the evaluation of various reinforcement learning algorithms, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training and testing. The introduction provides context about traffic congestion and CO2 emissions, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the software used, such as SUMO for traffic simulation, which suggests that they may have utilized specific traffic simulation datasets or scenarios.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using a simulation environment (SUMO) but do not specify any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the setup and parameters for their simulations, indicating that they generated their own data through the simulation process rather than using pre-existing datasets.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that the authors created their own datasets through simulations. However, I will still check the **references section** to see if any cited works provide datasets or methodologies that could be relevant.

In the references, I find several papers that discuss traffic signal control and reinforcement learning, but none of them explicitly mention datasets that were used in this study. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **SUMO Simulation Data**: The authors utilized the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) software to create their own traffic simulation data for evaluating their proposed methods. This data is not a publicly available dataset but rather generated through their experimental setup.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to provide, I will document the use of SUMO as the source of the experimental data.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, noting the absence of publicly available datasets and the reliance on simulated data generated through the SUMO environment. This will be important for anyone looking to replicate or build upon the research presented in this paper.
