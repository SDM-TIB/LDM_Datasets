To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design of Interplanetary Missions" by Alessandro Zavoli and Lorenzo Federici, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any associated metrics or features.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of reinforcement learning for trajectory design, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the simulation environments and scenarios used for training and testing their models. I will note these environments as they may serve as a basis for future dataset creation or experimentation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. If the authors refer to previous studies that utilized specific datasets, I will extract those citations as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. If no specific datasets are identified, I will summarize the simulation environments and their significance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and provide a clear reference for each dataset or simulation environment discussed in the paper. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the study.
