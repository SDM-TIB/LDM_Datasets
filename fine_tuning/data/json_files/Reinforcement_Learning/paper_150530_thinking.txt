To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Practical Robust Reinforcement Learning: Adjacent Uncertainty Set and Double-Agent Algorithm" by Ukjo Hwang and Songnam Hong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a robust reinforcement learning algorithm and mentions experiments, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any named datasets or references to existing datasets.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets in the experiments section. However, they refer to environments from **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, which is a well-known collection of environments used for reinforcement learning research. 

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citation for OpenAI Gym, as it is the primary source of datasets used in the experiments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI. "OpenAI Gym." GitHub repository. https://github.com/openai/gym. Accessed October 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is the primary source of datasets used in the experiments, providing various environments for reinforcement learning tasks.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
