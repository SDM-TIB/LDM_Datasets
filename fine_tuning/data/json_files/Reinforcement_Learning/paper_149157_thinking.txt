To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEEN: Sharpening Explanations for Graph Neural Networks using Explanations from Neighborhoods" by Hyeoncheol Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "widely used synthetic datasets for measuring explanation accuracy on node classification." This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **BA-Shapes**: This dataset consists of Barabasi-Albert (BA) graphs decorated with house-structured motifs in random positions. The nodes are numbered 0 to 3 for not-participating positions.

2. **BA-Community**: This dataset is a combination of two graphs from the BA-Shapes dataset, with doubled node classes. Each node has features based on its community membership.

3. **Tree-Cycles**: This dataset contains an 8-level tree with randomly attached hexagonal cycle motifs, and the task is to binary classify each node based on participation in cycle motifs.

4. **Tree-Grid**: This dataset replaces the cycle motifs in Tree-Cycles with 3-by-3 grid motifs.

The authors also note that the data splits for each dataset are taken from the code by Luo et al., which divides the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following works:

- For the **BA-Shapes** and **BA-Community** datasets, the citation is:
  > Ying, R., Bourgeois, D., You, J., Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2019). GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks. In NeurIPS.

- For the **Tree-Cycles** and **Tree-Grid** datasets, the citation is also:
  > Ying, R., Bourgeois, D., You, J., Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2019). GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks. In NeurIPS.

Since all four datasets are derived from the same source, I will use the same citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
