To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Visual Models by Causal Attribution" by Álvaro Paraíta and Jordi Vitrià, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel explanation methodology based on causal counterfactuals but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **3D Shapes dataset** as the basis for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding their methodology and results.

In the experiments section, the authors provide a brief description of the **3D Shapes dataset**, stating that it consists of 480,000 synthetic images with various factors such as object shape, wall and floor hue, and camera orientation. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **3D Shapes dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **3D Shapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Burgess, A. P. K. K. Dimakis, and S. Vishwanath. *3D Shapes Dataset*. 2018. Available at: https://github.com/deepmind/3dshapes-dataset/.

Since this dataset is the only one explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
