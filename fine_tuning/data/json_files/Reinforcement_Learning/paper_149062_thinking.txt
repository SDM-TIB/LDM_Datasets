To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning by Design: Structuring and Documenting the Human Choices in Machine Learning Development" by Simon Aagaard Enni and Ira Assent, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the importance of documenting human choices in machine learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work and methodology sections** for any references to datasets used in their research or examples. The methodology section outlines a design method but does not specify any datasets directly. 

I will then check the **examples provided in the methodology** to see if any datasets are referenced. The authors mention using a fictitious ML system designed for object detection modeled on AlexNet, but they do not provide specific datasets used in their examples.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the research. The references include various papers, but I need to determine if any of these papers correspond to datasets that were utilized in their work.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments or examples. Instead, they focus on the design choices and methodologies in machine learning without providing specific datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will summarize the findings and note that the paper emphasizes the importance of documenting design choices in machine learning rather than focusing on specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings into a structured summary, noting the absence of specific datasets in the paper and highlighting the focus on methodological transparency in machine learning development.
