To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Learning from Demonstrations by Learning from Experience" by Liu Haofeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of imitation learning and mentions the use of the **D4RL dataset** for experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction highlights the use of human expert demonstrations and mentions that the experiments involve limited demonstrations from the **D4RL benchmark**. This reinforces the importance of the D4RL dataset.

Moving on to the **methodology** section, particularly section IV, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors state that they prepared **100 expert demonstrations from the D4RL dataset** for their tasks. This confirms the dataset's role in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any further details about the datasets used. The authors describe the environments they tested their method on, including **Mujoco simulations**. They mention that they collected demonstrations from the **D4RL benchmark**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the D4RL dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **D4RL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **D4RL Dataset**: Used for collecting expert demonstrations in the experiments. It includes various tasks and is designed to facilitate research in reinforcement learning.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the D4RL dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
