To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Deep Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks with Linear Policy Networks" by Annie Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions benchmarking various methods on classical reinforcement learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. They refer to "classic control tasks from OpenAI Gym" and "Atari games," which indicates that these could be datasets or environments relevant to their study.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets or environments used for benchmarking. The authors describe their experimental setup and mention environments like "CartPole," "LunarLander," "Swimmer," "HalfCheetah," and various Atari games. These are likely the datasets or environments they utilized.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these environments were indeed used for evaluation. The authors present results for these environments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several foundational works related to the environments:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The environments like CartPole and LunarLander are part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **MuJoCo**: The environments like Swimmer and HalfCheetah are part of the MuJoCo physics engine. The citation for MuJoCo is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

3. **Atari Learning Environment**: The Atari games mentioned (e.g., Boxing, Space Invaders) are part of the Atari Learning Environment. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:
   > Machado, M., Bellemare, M. G., Talvatie, E., Veness, J., Hausknecht, M., & Bowling, M. (2018). Revisiting the arcade learning environment: Evaluation protocols and open problems for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 61, 523-562.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations. I will then prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
