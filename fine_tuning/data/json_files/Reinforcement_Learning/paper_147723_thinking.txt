To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning for Optimal Control of Continuous-time Systems" by Biao Luo, Derong Liu, and Tingwen Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using data collected from real systems for their Q-learning algorithms. However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the data collection process and the types of systems involved, such as a linear F-16 aircraft plant and a numerical nonlinear system. 

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the datasets are derived from simulations and real system data rather than established datasets. I will also check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper.

If I find any relevant datasets mentioned in the references, I will extract their full citations. If no specific datasets are identified, I will summarize the types of data used (e.g., simulation data from the F-16 aircraft plant) and note that they are not publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the absence of specific dataset citations if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if they are not formally cited.
