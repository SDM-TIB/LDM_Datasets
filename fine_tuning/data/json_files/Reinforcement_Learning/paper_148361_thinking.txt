To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Importance of Using Appropriate Baselines for Evaluation of Data-Efficiency in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Atari" by Kacper P. Kielak, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of deep reinforcement learning methods on Atari games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the Atari Learning Environment as a benchmark for assessing performance, which indicates that this environment is likely a dataset or a collection of datasets.

Moving on to **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. The author mentions evaluating algorithms on different subsets of Atari games from the Atari Learning Environment. This section should provide clarity on which specific datasets or game subsets were utilized.

In the **References section**, I will check for any citations that may correspond to the datasets mentioned. The Atari Learning Environment is often referenced in the context of reinforcement learning research, so I will look for its full citation.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: This is a widely used benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. It consists of various Atari games that serve as environments for training and testing RL agents.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the Atari Learning Environment from the references:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
