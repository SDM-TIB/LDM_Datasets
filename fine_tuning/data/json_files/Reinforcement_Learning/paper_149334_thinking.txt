To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prioritized Experience-based Reinforcement Learning with Human Guidance for Autonomous Driving" by Jingda Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention two autonomous driving scenarios: **Unprotected Left-Turn** and **Highway Congestion**. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in the abstract or introduction. Therefore, I will check the **experimental setup** and **results sections** for any references to datasets or simulation environments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors used the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments, which is a well-known open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. This indicates that the datasets used for training and testing the models are generated from this simulator.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the CARLA simulator in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset. The citation for CARLA is:

> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1-16).

Since CARLA is the primary dataset used in the experiments, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for CARLA as it is crucial for proper attribution in research.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset information are as follows:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Identify the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used.
4. Retrieve the full citation for CARLA from the references.
5. Document the dataset information clearly and accurately.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant dataset information from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
