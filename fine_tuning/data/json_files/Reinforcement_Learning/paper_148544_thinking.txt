To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Data Augmentation using Locally Factored Dynamics" by Silviu Pitis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets like "Spriteworld" or "Pong," I will note these down. I will also pay attention to any descriptions that provide context about how these datasets are used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important because proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Spriteworld" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I may need to search for it in the literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
