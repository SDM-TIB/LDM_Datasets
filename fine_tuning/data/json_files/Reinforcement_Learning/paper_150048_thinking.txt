To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Efficient Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Optimal Perimeter Control of Network Traffic Dynamics" by Can Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. This section often contains specific names and characteristics of datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any results that reference datasets, as authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing their models here.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are clear and concise, providing enough detail for someone else to understand the context and significance of each dataset used in the research.
