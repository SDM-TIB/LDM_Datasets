To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Rewards for Fast Learning" by Henry Sowerby et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and experiments to find specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **Problem Setting** and **Reward Construction via Linear Programming** sections for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe environments or specific datasets they utilized for testing their reward functions.

I will also examine the **Principles of Good Reward Design** section, as it may contain references to any experimental setups or datasets used to validate their findings.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of states, actions, or specific characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider whether the authors refer to any established benchmarks or commonly used datasets in reinforcement learning literature. In such cases, I will provide citations for those datasets based on the context given in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
