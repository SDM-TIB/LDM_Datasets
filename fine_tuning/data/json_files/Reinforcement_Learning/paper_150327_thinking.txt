To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LegendreTron: Uprising Proper Multiclass Loss Learning" by Kevin H. Lam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of Zalando's article images, intended as a more challenging replacement for MNIST, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
3. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: A dataset of Japanese handwritten characters, also containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
4. **LIBSVM**: A collection of datasets for support vector machines, which includes various datasets from different domains.
5. **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: A well-known repository that contains numerous datasets for machine learning tasks.
6. **Statlog Project**: A collection of datasets used for benchmarking classification algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
