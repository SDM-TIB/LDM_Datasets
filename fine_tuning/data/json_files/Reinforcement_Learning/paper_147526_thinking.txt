To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CytonRL: an Efficient Reinforcement Learning Open-source Toolkit Implemented in C++" by Xiaolin Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and benchmark sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the toolkit achieves competitive performances on the popular Atari game of Breakout, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author discusses any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction primarily discusses the toolkit's purpose and its implementation but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the implementation of the algorithms. The paper describes various deep Q-learning algorithms but does not specify datasets in this section either.

In the **benchmark section**, I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used for testing the performance of CytonRL. The paper states that CytonRL was tested on the Atari game of Breakout, which indicates that the Atari dataset is being used for evaluation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR) 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari dataset, ready for review or further processing.
