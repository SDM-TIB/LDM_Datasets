To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Consensus Maximization and Model Fitting" by Fei Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss the applications of the proposed method, as they often include references to datasets used for testing. For example, the authors might mention datasets related to robust fitting, homography estimation, or registration tasks.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Bunny dataset from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository," I will look for the full citation in the references. Similarly, if they refer to datasets used for homography estimation or rotation registration, I will ensure to find their corresponding citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all datasets are clearly documented with their respective citations.
