To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control: Comparison with Commercial Systems" by Alvaro Cabrejas-Egea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of various architectures for traffic signal control (TSC) and comparisons with commercial systems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **experimental results** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize experimental setups, as they often include dataset names or descriptions.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any references to simulation environments or datasets used for training the reinforcement learning agents. The authors mention using **PTV Vissim**, a commercial traffic simulator, which indicates that the experiments are based on simulated traffic data rather than real-world datasets. I will note this as it is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **experimental results section** for any specific datasets or scenarios described. The authors discuss various experiments conducted on different traffic scenarios, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Instead, they describe the traffic conditions and parameters used in the simulations, such as vehicle demand and intersection configurations.

After gathering this information, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the simulation tools or methodologies used. While the paper does not mention specific datasets in the traditional sense, it references several foundational works and tools that are relevant to the experiments.

For the citations, I will note the following:

1. **PTV Vissim**: While not a dataset in the conventional sense, it is a critical tool used for the simulations. The citation for PTV Vissim is not provided in the paper, so I will note that it is a commercial software used for traffic simulation.

2. **MOVA**: The authors reference MOVA as a traffic control system. The citation for MOVA is:
   > Vincent, R.A., & Peirce, J.R. (1988). 'MOVA': Traffic Responsive, Self-optimising Signal Control for Isolated Intersections. Traffic Management Division, Traffic Group, Transport and Road Research.

3. **SurTrac**: Another system mentioned is SurTrac. The citation for SurTrac is:
   > Smith, S.F., & Barlow, G.J. (2013). SURTRAC: Scalable Urban Traffic Control. Transport Research Board.

4. **Cyclic Controllers**: The paper discusses cyclic controllers but does not provide a specific citation for them.

In summary, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it references simulation environments and traffic control systems that are essential for understanding the experiments conducted. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
