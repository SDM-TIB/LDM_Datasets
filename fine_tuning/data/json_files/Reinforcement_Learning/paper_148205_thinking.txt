To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated curriculum generation for Policy Gradients from Demonstrations" by Anirudh Srinivasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **BabyAI platform**, which suggests that this platform may be a dataset or environment used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the BabyAI platform in detail. They mention that it comprises multiple levels with various challenges for the agent to learn. This implies that the BabyAI platform itself serves as a dataset for training and evaluating their method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used **1000 demonstrations from the expert for all the levels** in BabyAI. This reinforces the idea that the BabyAI platform is a significant dataset for their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the BabyAI platform. The relevant citation is:

- For **BabyAI**:
  > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Salem Lahlou, Lucas Willems, Chitwan Saharia, Thien Huu Nguyen, and Yoshua Bengio. *BabyAI: First steps towards grounded language learning with a human in the loop*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX.

Since the BabyAI platform is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
