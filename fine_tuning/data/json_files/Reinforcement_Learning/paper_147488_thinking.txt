To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth and nonlinearity induce implicit exploration for RL" by Justas Dauparas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses reinforcement learning (RL) and mentions standard benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the exploration in RL and hint at empirical investigations on standard benchmark tasks. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors list the specific tasks used for their experiments. They mention using the following OpenAI Gym tasks: **mountaincar-v0**, **cartpole-v0**, and **acrobat-v1**. This indicates that these tasks are the datasets or environments they utilized for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to these tasks, confirming their use in the experiments. 

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is referenced in the paper. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, I will use this citation for all three tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as it encompasses the datasets used in the experiments.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately documented with their respective citations.
