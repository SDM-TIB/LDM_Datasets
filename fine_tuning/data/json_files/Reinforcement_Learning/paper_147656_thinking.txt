To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning with External Knowledge and Two-Stage Q-functions for Predicting Popular Reddit Threads" by Ji He, Mari Ostendorf, and Xiaodong He, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on predicting the popularity of comments in Reddit discussions, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Reddit discussions.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention conducting experiments on data from **five subreddits**: askscience, askmen, todayilearned, askwomen, and politics. Each subreddit is associated with a specific number of posts and comments, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

In this section, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the basic statistics of the filtered subreddits, including the number of posts and comments. This table will help me gather specific details about the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors reference a previous work by He et al. (2016b), which proposed the task of Reddit popularity prediction. This citation is important as it may lead to the original dataset used for this task.

The full citation for the referenced work is:
> He, J., Ostendorf, M., He, X., Chen, J., Gao, J., Li, L., & Deng, L. (2016b). Deep reinforcement learning with a combinatorial action space for predicting popular Reddit threads. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. http://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1189.

Additionally, I will note the URLs for the subreddits used in the experiments, as they provide direct access to the datasets:
- askscience: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/
- askmen: https://www.reddit.com/r/askmen/
- todayilearned: https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/
- askwomen: https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/
- politics: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations and relevant details for each dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured and ready for further processing or review.
