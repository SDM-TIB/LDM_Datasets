To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design Representation as Semantic Networks" by Serhad Sarica, Ji Han, and Jianxi Luo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a pre-trained large-scale cross-domain design knowledge base, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **literature review and methodology sections**. In the literature review, the authors mention several large public cross-domain knowledge bases, including **WordNet**, **ConceptNet**, **B-Link**, and **TechNet**. These are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather knowledge bases that serve as sources for the semantic networks discussed in the paper.

In the methodology section, the authors describe their participatory study and the use of these knowledge bases to generate semantic networks from design descriptions. They specifically mention using **WordNet**, **ConceptNet**, and **TechNet** to create semantic networks based on a design description of a "spherical robot." This indicates that these knowledge bases are integral to the study's methodology.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these knowledge bases:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets (or knowledge bases) identified in the paper, ensuring to include their full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
