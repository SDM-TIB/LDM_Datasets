To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Better Interpretability in Deep Q-Networks" by Raghuram Mandyam Annasamy and Katia Sycara, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention that they report the performance of their model on **eight Atari environments**. This indicates that the datasets used for training and evaluation are likely related to these environments.

I will then look for a specific section that might be labeled as **Datasets** or **Experimental Setup**. In this paper, the authors refer to the **OpenAI Gym** as the source of the Atari environments, which suggests that the datasets are derived from this platform.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym Atari Environments**: The citation for the OpenAI Gym, which includes the Atari environments used in the experiments, is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. 

Next, I will ensure that I have captured any additional datasets or relevant information that may be mentioned in the **related work** or **conclusion** sections, but it seems that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the Atari environments from OpenAI Gym.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I have the correct citations and descriptions ready for any structured output or further processing. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
