To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated scoring of pre-REM sleep in mice with deep learning" by Niklas Grieger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the dataset used for scoring sleep stages in mice.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data acquisition**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including the number of mice, recording days, and the total number of segments. They mention that the dataset consists of polysomnographic recordings from 18 mice, which is crucial information.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was split into training, validation, and test sets. The paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the characteristics of the dataset, which will be important for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The dataset does not have a specific name mentioned, but it can be referred to as the "Polysomnographic recordings dataset of mice."
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of polysomnographic recordings from 18 male C57BL/6J mice, totaling 454,280 segments of 10 seconds each, recorded over 52 days.
   - **Usage**: The dataset was used to train and evaluate a neural network for automated sleep scoring, including the classification of Wake, NREM, REM, and pre-REM sleep stages.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be original to the study and does not reference an external dataset, I will note that the authors have provided their own data.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and ensure that I have the full citation for the paper itself, which will serve as the reference for the dataset:

- **Full Citation**:
  > Grieger, N., Schwabedal, J. T. C., Wendel, S., Ritze, Y., & Bialonski, S. (2021). Automated scoring of pre-REM sleep in mice with deep learning. *Scientific Reports*, 11, 12245. DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-91286-0

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations.
