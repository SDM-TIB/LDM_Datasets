To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffeomorphic Counterfactuals with Generative Models" by Ann-Kathrin Dombrowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of counterfactuals and generative models, which may hint at specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, annotated with 40 attribute labels.
3. **CheXpert**: A dataset of labeled chest X-rays, which includes uncertainty labels and expert comparisons.
4. **Mall Dataset**: A dataset for crowd counting, consisting of video frames from a shopping mall with head annotations of pedestrians.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of these datasets and to gather any additional details about how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Li Deng. The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6):141–142, 2012.

- For **CelebA**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild. In *Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, December 2015.

- For **CheXpert**:
  > Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, et al. CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, volume 33, pages 590–597, 2019.

- For **Mall Dataset**:
  > Ke Chen, Chen Change Loy, Shaogang Gong, and Tony Xiang. Feature mining for localized crowd counting. *British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)*, 1(2):3, 2012.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
