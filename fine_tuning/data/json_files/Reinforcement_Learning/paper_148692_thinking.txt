To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAP Propagation Algorithm: Faster Learning with a Team of Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Stephen Chung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for comparison or evaluation, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In the experiments section, I will identify any datasets that are used in the various tasks described, such as the multiplexer task, scalar regression task, and reinforcement learning tasks (Acrobot, CartPole, LunarLander, and MountainCar). I will note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources cited that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the experiments.

For example, if the paper mentions using the OpenAI Gym environments for reinforcement learning tasks, I will note that and find the appropriate citation for OpenAI Gym.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
