To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting Multi-Modal Tokens to Enhance End-to-End Autonomous Driving Imitation Learning with LLMs" by Yiqun Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using the **CARLA simulator** for experiments, which suggests that the dataset may be related to this simulator.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. In the **experimental setting section**, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they collected **1000 routes in 8 official town maps** using the CARLA simulator. This indicates that the CARLA simulator is a primary source of data for their experiments.

I will also check the **evaluation benchmark section**, where they mention using the CARLA simulator for both online and offline evaluations. This reinforces the idea that the CARLA simulator is integral to their dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is the primary dataset used in their research. The citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1â€“16). PMLR.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the CARLA simulator is the main dataset utilized in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the CARLA simulator, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
