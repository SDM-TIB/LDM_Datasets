To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A deep learning model for burn depth classification using ultrasound imaging" by Sangrock Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the model is trained using B-mode ultrasound images of both unburned and burned skin samples, which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods and Materials** section, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will find specific information about the datasets used for training and validation.

1. **In situ postmortem porcine skin dataset**: This dataset consists of B-mode ultrasound images collected from controlled burn experiments on postmortem pigs. The authors specify that they performed burns at various depths and collected 80 images for each burn condition, totaling 320 images across four burn depths.

2. **Ex vivo porcine skin dataset**: This dataset includes B-mode ultrasound images of unburned and full-thickness burned skin samples. The authors mention that this dataset comprises 120 images, with 60 images for each condition.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments and not from previously published datasets, I will note that the citations for these datasets are not applicable in the traditional sense. Instead, I will document the datasets as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the data collection process.

Finally, I will prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
