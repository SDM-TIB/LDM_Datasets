To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing Far-Field Speaker System via Teacher-Student Learning" by Jinyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "parallel close-talk and simulated far-field data," which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Far-Field Speaker System)**, where the authors describe the development of the KWS and AM components. Here, they mention the use of "paired close-talk and far-field speech" for their experiments, which suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Speech Recognition)**, the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two types of far-field test sets:
1. **38k-words play-back set**: This dataset is obtained by replaying close-talk live Cortana data through an artificial mouth.
2. **Live data from pre-release users**: This dataset contains 109k words collected from users.

In **section 4.2 (Keyword Spotting)**, the authors describe the training data for the KWS model, which includes:
- **760-hour simulated beamformed data**: This dataset is created from 380 hours of utterances with "Hey Cortana" and 380 hours without it.
- **600 hours live data**: This dataset is used to improve the KWS model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets described in the paper do not have specific citations like traditional datasets (e.g., Penn Action Dataset). Instead, they are derived from proprietary data sources related to Microsoft's Cortana system.

Since the datasets are not publicly available or cited in the traditional sense, I will note that the datasets are based on proprietary Microsoft data and summarize their descriptions accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the descriptions and any relevant details about the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
