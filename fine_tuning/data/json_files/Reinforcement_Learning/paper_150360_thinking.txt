To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Private Deep Q-Learning for Pattern Privacy Preservation in MEC Offloading" by Shuying Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses a computation offloading strategy but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** (if available) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In this case, the paper includes a section on simulation results, which typically provides insights into the datasets utilized.

In the **simulation results section**, the authors mention that they conducted simulations with an MEC system consisting of a cloud server, an edge server, and multiple mobile devices (MDs). However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets but rather describe the parameters and distributions of the tasks arriving at the edge server. They mention that the data size and required CPU cycles for arriving tasks are uniformly generated between specific ranges, which indicates that they are using synthetic data rather than a named dataset.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to reference. However, I will note that the authors used synthetic data generated based on uniform distributions for their simulations.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets:

- **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated task data sizes uniformly between 5 MB and 50 MB and required CPU cycles uniformly between 0.5 and 1011 cycles for their simulations. No external datasets were used or referenced.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will conclude my extraction process here. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have looked for their full citations in the references section to ensure proper documentation.
