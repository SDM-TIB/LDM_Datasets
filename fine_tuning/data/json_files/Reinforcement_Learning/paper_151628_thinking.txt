To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time system optimal traffic routing under uncertainties â€“ Can physics models boost reinforcement learning?" by Zemian Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **three transportation networks**. I will look for specific names or identifiers for these networks, as they may serve as datasets for the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from previous works or established datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset like the **TSMO network**, I will ensure to find its full citation, which may include details such as the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
