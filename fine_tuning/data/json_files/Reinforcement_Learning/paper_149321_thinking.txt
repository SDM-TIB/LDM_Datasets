To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Nonlinear Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles Using Learned Conditional Probabilistic Models of Agent Futures" by Ashkan Jasour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the **Argoverse** and **CARLA** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and confirm that they used the **Argoverse** and **CARLA** datasets for training their models. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **Argoverse dataset**, the citation is:
> Chang, M.-F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, A., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., et al. (2019). *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 8748–8757.

For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 1–16.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or by other researchers.
