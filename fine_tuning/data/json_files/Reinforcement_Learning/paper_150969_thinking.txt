To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Increasingly Large Extremal Graphs with AlphaZero and Tabu Search" by Abbas Mehrabian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they release graphs to the research community, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with their findings. I will look for a specific section that discusses the datasets or graphs in detail, likely found in a section labeled **"Datasets"** or similar.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention releasing graphs to aid further research, specifically at the end of the introduction and in the summary of contributions. They provide a link to the dataset: https://storage.googleapis.com/gdm_girth5_graphs/girth5_graphs.zip. This indicates that the dataset consists of graphs generated through their methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for any datasets or related works that are referenced. Since the dataset is a release by the authors themselves, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Mehrabian, A., Anand, A., Kim, H., Sonnerat, N., Balog, M., Comanici, G., Berariu, T., Lee, A., Ruoss, A., Bulanova, A., Toyama, D., Blackwell, S., Paredes, B. R., Veliƒçkovic, P., Orseau, L., Precup, D., & Wagner, A. Z. (2024). *Finding Increasingly Large Extremal Graphs with AlphaZero and Tabu Search*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2024). Available at: https://storage.googleapis.com/gdm_girth5_graphs/girth5_graphs.zip.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the citation, into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
