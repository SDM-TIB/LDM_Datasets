To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Classifier Robustness through Active Generation of Pairwise Counterfactuals" by Ananth Balashankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) and mentions improvements in robustness on "6 out-of-domain datasets." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that explicitly discuss datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention two primary datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, containing 4,000 samples, with counterfactuals generated for evaluation. The paper states that the counterfactual dataset had 2,000 samples with human labels.

2. **Quora Question Pair (QQP)**: This dataset is used for determining semantic equivalence between question pairs. The original dataset consists of 20,000 samples, and the authors mention that 1,911 samples were human-annotated for evaluation.

In addition to these primary datasets, the authors also refer to **out-of-domain datasets** for testing robustness, including:

- **IMDB movie reviews**
- **Amazon reviews**
- **SemEval Twitter reviews**
- **Yelp reviews**

These datasets are mentioned in the context of evaluating the generalizability of the proposed methods.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
