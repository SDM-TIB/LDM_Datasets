To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse" by Martin Pawelczyk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimentation with real-world and synthetic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) in detail, as this is likely where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset originates from the 1994 Census database and consists of 14 attributes and 48,842 instances. The class label indicates whether an individual has an income greater than 50,000 USD/year.

2. **Home Equity Line of Credit (Heloc) Dataset**: This dataset contains 23 attributes and records a score indicating whether individuals will repay the Heloc account within a fixed time window.

3. **Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset includes information on diabetic patients from 130 different US hospitals, described using administrative and medical records, with a prediction task focused on identifying whether a patient will be readmitted within the next 30 days.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

- For the **Heloc Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The dataset is not attributed to a specific paper in the provided text, so I will note that it may require further investigation to find a proper citation.

- For the **Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Strack, B., DeShazo, J. P., Gennings, C., Olmo, J. L., Ventura, S., Cios, K. J., & Clore, J. N. (2014). Impact of HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates: analysis of 70,000 clinical database patient records. BioMed Research International.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as identified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper attribution.
