To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POMO: Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima for Reinforcement Learning" by Yeong-Dae Kwon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that POMO is evaluated on three popular NP-hard problems: traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated vehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). This indicates that there may be datasets associated with these problems.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly the subsections that discuss the methodology and results for each problem. In the experiments, the authors describe how they implemented POMO for TSP, CVRP, and KP, but I need to find specific datasets or benchmarks they used for these evaluations.

In the **TSP section**, the authors mention using randomly sampled node locations from the unit square for the TSP problems (TSP20, TSP50, TSP100). This suggests that the datasets are generated rather than sourced from a pre-existing dataset.

For the **CVRP section**, they also describe using customer nodes sampled uniformly from the unit square, indicating that the dataset is similarly generated for the capacitated vehicle routing problem.

In the **0-1 knapsack problem section**, the authors state that they prepare a set of items with weights and values randomly sampled from a specified range. Again, this indicates that the dataset is generated rather than sourced from an established dataset.

Since the datasets for TSP, CVRP, and KP are generated specifically for the experiments and do not reference external datasets, I will note this in my documentation.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets:

1. **TSP Datasets**: 
   - Description: Randomly sampled node locations from the unit square for TSP problems (TSP20, TSP50, TSP100).
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated dataset).

2. **CVRP Datasets**: 
   - Description: Customer nodes sampled uniformly from the unit square for CVRP problems (CVRP20, CVRP50, CVRP100).
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated dataset).

3. **0-1 Knapsack Datasets**: 
   - Description: A set of items with weights and values randomly sampled from (0, 1) for KP problems (KP50, KP100, KP200).
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated dataset).

Since these datasets are generated for the purpose of the experiments and do not have formal citations, I will document them as such. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
