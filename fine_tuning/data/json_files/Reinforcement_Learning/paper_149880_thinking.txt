To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Parametric Class of Approximate Gradient Updates for Policy Optimization" by Ramki Gummadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In the abstract, the authors discuss conducting experiments on "popular deep RL benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on **Section 6 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using datasets from various environments, specifically:

1. **Synthetic 2D Contextual Bandit**: This dataset consists of samples generated from a 2D parameter space, where states and actions are defined, and rewards are calculated based on a sigmoid function.

2. **FourRoom Environment**: This dataset is used in a reinforcement learning context where the agent receives rewards based on reaching a goal cell.

3. **MuJoCo Suite**: The authors mention using benchmarks from the MuJoCo suite for continuous control tasks, which are standard datasets in reinforcement learning research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge in the field:

- For the **Synthetic 2D Contextual Bandit**, there may not be a formal citation since it is a constructed dataset for the purpose of the experiments.

- For the **FourRoom Environment**, the citation is:
  > Precup, D. *Temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning*. University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2000.

- For the **MuJoCo Suite**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have them, while noting that some datasets may not have formal citations due to their constructed nature.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the information provided.
