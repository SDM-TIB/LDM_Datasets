To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compound Returns Reduce Variance in Reinforcement Learning" by Brett Daley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of compound returns in reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention testing their methods on the **MinAtar** testbed, which is a collection of Atari-inspired environments designed for reinforcement learning experiments. This indicates that MinAtar is a dataset or benchmark used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MinAtar dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced MinAtar:

- For **MinAtar**, the citation is:
  > Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). *MinAtar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MinAtar**: A testbed for reinforcement learning experiments, consisting of several Atari-inspired environments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
