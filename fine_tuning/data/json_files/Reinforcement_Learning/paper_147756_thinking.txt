To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual Argumentation Mining: Machine Translation (and a bit of Projection) is All You Need!" by Steffen Eger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The authors mention creating parallel corpora by translating a popular argumentation mining dataset into multiple languages. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the inadequacy of existing resources for cross-lingual argumentation mining and highlight their contributions, including the creation of new datasets. This section will likely provide names or descriptions of the datasets.

In the **data section (Section 3)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. I will look for specific names, sizes, and characteristics of each dataset. The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **Microtexts (MTX)**: This dataset consists of 112 German short texts annotated according to a version of Freeman’s theory of argumentation macro-structure. It is the first parallel corpus for argumentation mining in English and German.

2. **Chinese Review Corpus (CRC)**: Created by Li et al. (2017), this dataset is the only large-scale argument mining dataset in Chinese, containing hotel reviews annotated with argumentation structures.

3. **A Large-Scale Parallel Dataset of Persuasive Essays (PE)**: This dataset was created by Stab and Gurevych (2017) and consists of 402 persuasive essays written by students. The authors translated this dataset into German, Spanish, French, and Chinese.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Microtexts (MTX)**, the citation is:
  > Peldszus, A., & Stede, M. (2015). An annotated corpus of argumentative microtexts. In Argumentation and Reasoned Action: Proceedings of the 1st European Conference on Argumentation (pp. 801–815). Lisbon, Portugal.

- For **Chinese Review Corpus (CRC)**, the citation is:
  > Li, M., Geng, S., Gao, Y., Peng, S., Liu, H., & Wang, H. (2017). Crowdsourcing Argumentation Structures in Chinese Hotel Reviews. In Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (pp. 87–92). Banff, Canada.

- For **Persuasive Essays (PE)**, the citation is:
  > Stab, C., & Gurevych, I. (2017). Parsing argumentation structures in persuasive essays. Computational Linguistics, 43(3), 619–659.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
