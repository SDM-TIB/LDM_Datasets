To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ovarian Cancer Detection based on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Genetic Algorithm" by Ahmed Farag Seddik and Hassan Mostafa Ahmed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are using two serum SELDI mass spectra datasets for their research, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods and Datasets section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **OvarianCD_PostQAQC Data set**: This dataset is obtained using the WCX2 protein chip and consists of 95 normal and 121 diseased patterns, with each pattern containing 15,156 M/Z values and corresponding intensity values.

2. **Ovarian-cancer-nci-pbsii Data set**: This dataset is obtained using the nci-pbsii protein chip and consists of 91 normal and 162 cancerous patterns, also with each pattern containing 15,156 M/Z values and corresponding intensity values.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites relevant works that may provide context or original sources for the datasets used:

- For the **OvarianCD_PostQAQC Data set**, the citation is:
  > T.P. Conrads, et al., "High-resolution serum proteomic features for ovarian detection", *Endocrine-Related Cancer*, 11, 2004, pp. 163-178.

- For the **Ovarian-cancer-nci-pbsii Data set**, the citation is:
  > E.F. Petricoin, et al., "Use of proteomic patterns in serum to identify ovarian cancer", *Lancet*, 359(9306), 2002, pp. 572-577.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their authoritative references.
