To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Split Deep Q-Learning for Robust Object Singulation" by Iason Sarantopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the environments used for training and testing their models. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, especially in the context of training the reinforcement learning models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a simulated environment created with the **MuJoCo physics engine** for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly reference any publicly available datasets for training or evaluation. Instead, they describe the setup and parameters of their simulated environment, which includes various objects and configurations.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with citations, I will note that the authors rely on a simulation rather than external datasets. However, I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational works or datasets are cited that could be relevant to the context of their research.

In the references, I find citations for the **MuJoCo physics engine** and other relevant works, but no specific datasets are mentioned. The references include:

- E. Todorov, T. Erez, and Y. Tassa. "MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control." In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026–5033, IEEE, Oct 2012.
- E. Olson. "Apriltag: A robust and flexible visual fiducial system." In 2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3400–3407, IEEE, 2011.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Simulated Environment**: The authors used a simulated environment created with the MuJoCo physics engine for their experiments, but no specific datasets were referenced.
2. **References**: The paper cites foundational works related to the simulation environment but does not provide specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses the use of a simulated environment, it does not provide explicit datasets or their citations. This is an important aspect to note for anyone looking to replicate or build upon this research.
