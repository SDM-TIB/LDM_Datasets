To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Assisted Annotator using Reinforcement Learning" by V. Ratna Saripalli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of reinforcement learning for annotating health monitor alarm data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention the **PERSEUS program's data** and the **ATOMICS dataset**. 

1. **PERSEUS Dataset**: This dataset is derived from patient monitoring devices in an Emergency Department and contains 12 months of data formatted in JSON. It includes various physiological signals and alarm messages.

2. **ATOMICS Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the PERSEUS data, specifically annotated for clinically significant events. It is divided into three parts: ATOMICS-1, ATOMICS-2, and ATOMICS-3, with ATOMICS-1 used for training and ATOMICS-2 for testing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm the use of these datasets for their experiments, which solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PERSEUS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leo Kobayashi, Adewole Oyalowo, Uday Agrawal, Shyue-Ling Chen, Wael Asaad, Xiao Hu, Kenneth A Loparo, Gregory D Jay, and Derek L Merck. *Development and deployment of an open, modular, near-real-time patient monitor datastream conduit toolkit to enable healthcare multimodal data fusion in a live emergency department setting for experimental bedside clinical informatics research*. IEEE Sensors Letters, 3(1):1â€“4, 2018.

- For the **ATOMICS dataset**, since it is derived from the PERSEUS dataset and annotated by Kobayashi et al., I will use the same citation as above, as it is the authoritative source for the annotations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
