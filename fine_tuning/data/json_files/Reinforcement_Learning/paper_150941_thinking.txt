To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Convergence and Sample Complexity Analysis of Deep Q-Networks with Îµ-Greedy Exploration" by Shuai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, types of data, etc.).

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in the context of reinforcement learning and deep Q-networks. They may refer to standard datasets used in reinforcement learning or specific environments (like games) where their methods were tested.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari games** as a benchmark for their experiments, I will note that as a dataset. However, since Atari games are a well-known set of environments rather than a traditional dataset with a formal citation, I will ensure to clarify that in my documentation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include:

1. The name of the dataset or environment.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.
3. The full citation for the dataset or the source from which it can be accessed.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations.
