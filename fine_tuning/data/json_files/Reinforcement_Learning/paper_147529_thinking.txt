To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expected Policy Gradients" by Kamil Ciosek and Shimon Whiteson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical results in four challenging MuJoCo domains, which suggests that datasets related to these domains may be included.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. They mention using four domains modeled with the MuJoCo physics simulator: **HalfCheetah-v1, InvertedPendulum-v1, Reacher2d-v1, and Walker2d-v1**. This indicates that these domains serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. Since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning, I will look for their original sources:

1. **MuJoCo Physics Simulator**: The citation for the MuJoCo simulator, which includes the mentioned environments, is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, 5026â€“5033. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **HalfCheetah-v1**
- **InvertedPendulum-v1**
- **Reacher2d-v1**
- **Walker2d-v1**

And the full citation for the MuJoCo physics simulator, which encompasses these datasets, is provided above. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their authoritative sources.
