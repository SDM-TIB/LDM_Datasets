To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combine PPO with NES to Improve Exploration" by Lianjiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction will give context about the research and might mention specific datasets relevant to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using environments like "RollerBall" and "Pendulum" in OpenAI Gym, which are likely to be the datasets or environments they utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **background section** for any references to datasets or environments that are foundational to the research. The authors discuss reinforcement learning environments, which may lead to specific datasets or benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. For example, the paper references "OpenAI Gym" and "Unity" as platforms for their experiments. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for these references.

The citations I need to gather are:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., et al. "OpenAI Gym." pp. 1–4, 2016.

- For **Unity**, the citation is:
  > Juliani, A., Henry, H., and Lange, D. "Unity: A General Platform for Intelligent Agents." pp. 1–18, 2018.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format that clearly presents the information for each dataset used in the research. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets along with their full citations for future reference or analysis.
