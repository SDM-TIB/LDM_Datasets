To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Recurrent Q-learning for Energy-constrained Coverage with a Mobile Robot" by Aaron Zellner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will pay particular attention to sections that typically discuss datasets in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of coverage with energy constraints but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach and the environments used for testing.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the environments they tested their algorithm on. They mention using a **16 × 16 grid environment** with various obstacle configurations, but they do not specify any publicly available datasets.

Since the authors state that the datasets generated during the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, I will note this as a dataset source but will not be able to provide a full citation for a publicly available dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or related works that could be relevant. However, it appears that the references primarily cite foundational works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In summary, while the paper discusses the environments used for testing, it does not provide specific datasets with full citations. The only mention of datasets is that they are available upon request from the authors. Therefore, I will document this information accordingly.

1. **Grid Environment for Testing**: The authors created a custom 16 × 16 grid environment with various obstacle configurations for their experiments. No formal citation is available for this dataset as it is not publicly released.

2. **Availability**: The datasets generated during the study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to include, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.
