To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap between Label- and Reference-based Synthesis in Multi-attribute Image-to-Image Translation" by Qiusheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **CelebA dataset** and the **AFHQ dataset**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset.

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors state that they use the CelebA dataset, which contains 182,000 images for training and 19,962 images for testing. They also mention that they selected fourteen attributes for their experiments.

2. **AFHQ Dataset**: The authors refer to the AFHQ dataset, which consists of images of cats, dogs, and wild animals, with 5000 images per domain. They follow the settings established by StarGAN-V2 for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. 2014.

- For the **AFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *StarGAN: Unified generative adversarial networks for multi-domain image-to-image translation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8789â€“8797, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
