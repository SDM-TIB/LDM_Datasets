To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Closing the Sim-to-Real Gap in Collaborative Multi-Robot Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Wenshuai Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides an overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. While the introduction discusses the challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning, it does not seem to name any datasets directly.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about the simulation environment and the data used for training the models. The authors mention using a Kuka arm model in the Bullet physics engine, but I need to confirm if they refer to any specific datasets or if they are using synthetic data generated from simulations.

In the **experimentation section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the training and evaluation of the models. The authors describe the training parameters and the types of perturbations introduced, but they do not explicitly mention any external datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors primarily rely on a simulation environment (the Kuka arm in the Bullet physics engine) rather than external datasets. However, they do provide a link to their open-source code on GitHub, which may include synthetic data generation methods.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none mentioned. Instead, I will note that the research utilizes a simulation environment and synthetic data rather than established datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not reference any external datasets but relies on a simulation environment for its experiments. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have extracted their details and full citations accordingly.
