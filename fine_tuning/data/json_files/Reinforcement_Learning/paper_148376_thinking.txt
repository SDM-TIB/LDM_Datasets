To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithmic Parameter Optimisation of a Recurrent Spiking Neural Network Model" by Ifeatu Ezenwe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, as they often contain details about the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of optimizing parameters in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and mention the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) for this purpose. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where they describe the SNN model and the optimization process. Here, they mention using a specific neuronal model (Izhikevich model) and the parameters being optimized, but again, there is no direct mention of datasets.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors discuss the optimization results and the performance of the model, but they do not provide any specific datasets used for training or testing.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in their experiments. However, the references primarily consist of literature on spiking neural networks and genetic algorithms, without specific datasets being highlighted.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or did not specify them in the text. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.**
2. **No external datasets were cited in the references that could be linked to the experiments.**

This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of a research paper to identify any datasets, as they may not always be explicitly stated. If datasets are not mentioned, it is crucial to note that as well.
