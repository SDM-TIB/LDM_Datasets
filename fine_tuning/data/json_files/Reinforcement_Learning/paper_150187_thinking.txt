To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Latent Part-Whole Hierarchies for Point Clouds" by Xiang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on the **PartNet dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 6.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **PartNet Dataset**: This dataset consists of 573,585 fine-grained part annotations for 26,671 shapes across 24 different 3D object categories. The authors note that most of the 3D objects are annotated at three levels: coarse, middle, and fine-grained levels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PartNet dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For **PartNet Dataset**:
  > Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A. X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L. J., & Su, H. (2019). *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 909â€“918.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
