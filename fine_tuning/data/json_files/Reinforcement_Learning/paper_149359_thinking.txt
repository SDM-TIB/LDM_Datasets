To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Abbreviation Expansion in Context" by Kyle Gorman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a large, open-source dataset of ad hoc abbreviations, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 2), where the authors describe the dataset construction process. They mention that the dataset consists of English abbreviated/expanded sentence pairs, which is crucial information. I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its size, the method of collection, and any relevant statistics.

In **subsection 2.1 (Data set construction)**, the authors provide details about how they constructed the dataset from English Wikipedia sentences. They mention that they filtered sentences based on specific criteria, resulting in a dataset of approximately 27,000 sentences for annotation. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In **subsection 2.5 (Release)**, the authors state that they release all annotated data under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, which is important for understanding the dataset's accessibility.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Wikipedia Abbreviation Data**: This dataset consists of English sentences with ad hoc abbreviations and their expanded forms. It was created by sampling sentences from English Wikipedia and applying specific filters to ensure quality. The dataset includes training, development, and testing data.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the use of Wikipedia as the source of the sentences. Therefore, I will cite Wikipedia as the source of the data:

- For the **Wikipedia Abbreviation Data**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for the **Wikipedia Abbreviation Data** and ensure that I have the full citation ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted and documented the dataset from the research paper.
