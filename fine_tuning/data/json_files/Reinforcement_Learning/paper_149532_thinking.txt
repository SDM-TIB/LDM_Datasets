To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Duck Swarm Algorithm: A Novel Swarm Intelligence Algorithm" by Mengjian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Duck Swarm Algorithm (DSA) and mentions that its performance is verified using **eighteen benchmark functions**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmark functions. The authors state that they used **eighteen benchmark functions** to assess the performance of DSA. I will need to extract the names of these functions and any relevant details about them.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the benchmark functions are listed in **Table 2**. The functions include:

1. **Sphere**
2. **Schwefel 2.22**
3. **Schwefel 1.2**
4. **Schwefel 2.21**
5. **Rosenbrock**
6. **Cigar**
7. **Quartic**
8. **Schwefel 2.26**
9. **Rastrigin**
10. **Ackley**
11. **Griewank**
12. **Penalized 1**
13. **Penalized 2**
14. **Weierstrass**
15. **Shekel’s Foxholes**
16. **Kowalik’s**
17. **Six-hump camel back**
18. **Branin**

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these benchmark functions. The paper cites various sources for these functions, and I will need to ensure I capture the correct references for each function.

For example, the citation for the **Sphere function** is:
> 1. Qin A K, Huang V L, Suganthan P N (2009) Differential evolution algorithm with strategy adaptation for global numerical optimization. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 13(2): 398-417.

I will repeat this process for each of the eighteen benchmark functions, ensuring that I gather the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including the names of the benchmark functions and their respective citations, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
