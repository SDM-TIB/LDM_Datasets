To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR MATHEMATICAL REASONING VIA PROGRAM SYNTHESIS" by Joseph Palermo, Johnny Ye, and Alok Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors convert the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset** into a reinforcement learning environment, which suggests that this dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors explicitly mention the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset**. They describe it as consisting of synthetically generated math problems covering various problem types. This confirms that the dataset is indeed relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their approach and the modules they used, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they rely on the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is further referenced in the context of the modules they selected for their reinforcement learning environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> David Saxton, Edward Grefenstette, Felix Hill, and Pushmeet Kohli. *Analysing Mathematical Reasoning Abilities of Neural Models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset** and does not mention any other datasets, I will create a single entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the **DeepMind Mathematics Dataset**. This will provide a clear and structured output ready for review or further processing.
