To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficiently Evolving Swarm Behaviors Using Grammatical Evolution with PPA-Style Behavior Trees" by Aadesh Neupane and Michael A. Goodrich, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe two swarm tasks: **Foraging** and **Nest Maintenance**. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets). Instead, they describe the simulation environment and parameters used for their experiments. The paper mentions that the swarm simulation environment was created using the **Mesa agent-based modeling framework** and that the experiments were run with a population of 100 learning agents in a 100x100 grid environment.

Since there are no traditional datasets cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any relevant works that may have provided datasets or methodologies that could be considered datasets in the context of swarm behavior research.

After reviewing the references, I will note any relevant citations that could be associated with the methodologies or frameworks used in the experiments. For example, the Mesa framework and the specific algorithms mentioned (like GEESE and GEESE-BT) may have associated datasets or simulation environments that are relevant to the research.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets or frameworks referenced in the paper. If no traditional datasets are found, I will summarize the experimental setup and the simulation parameters as they relate to the research.

In conclusion, I will create a comprehensive list of any datasets or relevant frameworks mentioned in the paper, along with their full citations, to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
