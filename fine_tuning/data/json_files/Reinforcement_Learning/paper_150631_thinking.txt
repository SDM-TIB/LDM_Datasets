To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Driving with Deep Reinforcement Learning in CARLA Simulation" by Jumman Hossain, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the use of reinforcement learning in autonomous driving but does not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the author describes the use of the CARLA simulation environment. This suggests that the dataset used for training and testing the model is the CARLA simulation itself.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **results section**. The results section discusses the performance of the agent across various towns in the CARLA environment but does not mention any additional datasets. 

Since the CARLA simulation is a well-known open-source driving simulator, I will need to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. I will check the **References section** of the paper to locate the citation for CARLA.

The citation for the CARLA simulation is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16. PMLR, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset used in the research and retrieved its full citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CARLA Simulation Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training and testing the autonomous driving model. It provides a realistic environment for simulating various driving scenarios.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the CARLA dataset.
