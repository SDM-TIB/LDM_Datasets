To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Back to Basics: Revisiting REINFORCE Style Optimization for Learning from Human Feedback in LLMs" by Arash Ahmadian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and mention various methods, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two datasets:

1. **TL;DR Summarize Dataset**: This dataset contains 116,000 human-written instructions and 93,000 human-annotated preference pairs. It is used for training the models in the summarization task.

2. **Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (HH) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 112,000 training preference pairs and is used for training the models in the dialogue task.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **TL;DR Summarize Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nisan Stiennon, Long Ouyang, Jeff Wu, Daniel M. Ziegler, Ryan Lowe, Chelsea Voss, Alec Radford, Dario Amodei, and Paul Christiano. *Learning to summarize from human feedback*. In Proceedings of the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

- For the **Anthropic Helpful and Harmless Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuntao Bai, Andy Jones, Kamal Ndousse, Amanda Askell, Anna Chen, Nova DasSarma, Dawn Drain, Stanislav Fort, Deep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, Nicholas Joseph, Saurav Kadavath, Jackson Kernion, Tom Conerly, Sheer El-Showk, Nelson Elhage, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Danny Hernandez, and Jared Kaplan. *Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
