To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recursive Sparse Pseudo-input Gaussian Process SARSA" by John Martin and Brendan Englot, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** closely. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and context for the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to reinforcement learning or Gaussian processes, as these are the main topics of the research. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and the corresponding citations.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning tasks, I would ensure to include the full citation:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the findings presented in the paper.
