To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Vehicular Edge Computing: Joint Phase-shift Optimization and Multi-User Power Allocation" by Kangwei Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they typically detail the datasets used for validation. If there is a section explicitly labeled "Datasets" or "Data Collection," that will be my primary focus.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, as these will serve as the authoritative citations.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
