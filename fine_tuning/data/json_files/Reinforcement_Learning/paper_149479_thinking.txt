To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paris-CARLA-3D: A Real and Synthetic Outdoor Point Cloud Dataset for Challenging Tasks in 3D Mapping" by Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the Paris-CARLA-3D dataset consists of both real and synthetic data, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset construction section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is divided into two parts:

1. **Real Data**: This consists of 60 million points collected from a mobile LiDAR and camera system in Paris.
2. **Synthetic Data**: This includes 700 million points generated using the CARLA simulator.

The authors also provide a URL for accessing the dataset: https://npm3d.fr/paris-carla-3d, which is important for referencing.

In the **related datasets section**, the authors compare their dataset with others, but I will primarily focus on the datasets they created. They mention that the Paris-CARLA-3D dataset is unique in offering annotations and protocols for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and scene completion tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for the synthetic data, and they also mention the use of a mobile mapping system for the real data.

The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Paris-CARLA-3D dataset** itself, the citation is:
  > Deschaud, J.-E.; Duque, D.; Richa, J. P.; Velasco-Forero, S.; Marcotegui, B.; Goulette, F. *Paris-CARLA-3D: A Real and Synthetic Outdoor Point Cloud Dataset for Challenging Tasks in 3D Mapping*. Preprints 2021, 1, 0. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224713

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A.; Ros, G.; Codevilla, F.; Lopez, A.; Koltun, V. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, Mountain View, CA, USA, 13–15 November 2017; pp. 1–16.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes noting the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
