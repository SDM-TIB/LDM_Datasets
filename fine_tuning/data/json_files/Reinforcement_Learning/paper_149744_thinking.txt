To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Learning for Vehicular Dynamic Spectrum Access in Autonomous Driving" by Pawe≈Ç Sroka and Adrian Kliks, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for reliable wireless communication in autonomous driving, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **system model and simulation results sections**. These sections often contain details about the datasets used for simulations or experiments. In the **simulation setup**, the authors mention using a C++-based simulator to model motorway traffic, but they do not specify any datasets directly. Instead, they describe parameters and configurations for the simulations.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies and papers related to vehicular communication and dynamic spectrum access, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they relied on simulation parameters and models to conduct their research. Therefore, I will note that no specific datasets were extracted from this paper.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research.** The authors focused on simulation-based evaluations rather than empirical data from external datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses methodologies and simulations, it does not provide any datasets or citations for datasets. This is an important finding as it highlights the nature of the research conducted.
