To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STEEX: Steering Counterfactual Explanations with Semantics" by Paul Jacob et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on challenging datasets, specifically mentioning **CelebAMask-HQ** and **BDD100k**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental protocol. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **BDD100k**: This dataset is described as containing diverse driving scenes, with images annotated for high-level actions. The authors mention that the decision model was trained on a specific extension of this dataset, called BDD-OIA, which includes 20,000 scenes annotated with binary attributes.

2. **CelebAMask-HQ**: This dataset consists of high-quality face portraits with semantic segmentation annotations. The authors note that it contains 30,000 images and is used for evaluating classifiers that recognize specific facial attributes.

In addition, the authors reference **CelebA**, which is mentioned as a dataset used for comparison, although it is not the primary focus of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **BDD100k**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., Darrell, T. (2020). *BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2636-2645.

- For **CelebAMask-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Lee, C.H., Liu, Z., Wu, L., Luo, P. (2020). *MaskGAN: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730-3738.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
