To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Re3val: Reinforced and Reranked Generative Retrieval" by EuiYul Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that Re3val demonstrates top KILT scores across five datasets, indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is used for question answering tasks and is referenced as a benchmark in the paper.
2. **TriviaQA (TQA)**: Another dataset for question answering tasks, also part of the KILT benchmark.
3. **HotpotQA (HoPo)**: This dataset is utilized for multi-hop question answering tasks.
4. **FEVER**: A dataset for fact verification tasks.
5. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**: This dataset is used for dialogue tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were used, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
