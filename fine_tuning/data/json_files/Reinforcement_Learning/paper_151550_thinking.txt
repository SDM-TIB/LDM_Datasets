To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Argument Mining as Augmented Natural Language Generation" by Nilmadhab Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of Argument Mining (AM) and mention that they will evaluate their proposed method on several datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four standard datasets:

1. **Argument Annotated Essay (AAE)**: This dataset contains 402 student essays annotated at the paragraph level, with a total of 1833 paragraphs. It includes three AC types: Claim, MajorClaim, and Premise, and two AR types: Support and Attack.

2. **Abstracts of Randomized Controlled Trials (AbstRCT)**: This dataset consists of 700 abstracts from various medical trials, annotated at the span level. It includes three AC types: Claim, MajorClaim, and Evidence, and three AR types: Support, Attack, and Partial-Attack.

3. **Consumer Debt Collection Practices (CDCP)**: This dataset contains 731 user comments from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website. It features five AC types: Fact, Testimony, Reference, Policy, and Value, along with two AR types: Reason and Evidence.

4. **Fine-Grained Argument Annotated Essay (AAE-FG)**: This dataset is a more fine-grained version of the AAE, with nine AC types and unchanged AR types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
