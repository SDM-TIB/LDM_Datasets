To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A parallel-network continuous quantitative trading model with GARCH and PPO" by Wei Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five stocks from the Chinese stock market, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. They mention collecting data from five stocks in the Chinese stock market, specifically:

1. **SZ.002230**
2. **SZ.000333**
3. **SH.603288**
4. **SH.600030**
5. **SH.600276**

The authors specify that the data spans from 2011 to 2020 and includes different frequencies (5 min, 1 day with GARCH, and 1 week). This section confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. However, since the datasets are derived from stock market data, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source of the data, which is the Chinese stock market, and the specific stocks mentioned.

For the datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: SZ.002230 (Stock data from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange)
- **Dataset 2**: SZ.000333 (Stock data from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange)
- **Dataset 3**: SH.603288 (Stock data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange)
- **Dataset 4**: SH.600030 (Stock data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange)
- **Dataset 5**: SH.600276 (Stock data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange)

Since these datasets are based on stock market data, I will note that the data is sourced from the respective stock exchanges and spans the years 2011 to 2020.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the context of the data source, ready for structured output or further processing.
