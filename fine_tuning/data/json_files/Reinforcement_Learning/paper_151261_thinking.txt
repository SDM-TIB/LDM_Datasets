To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory" by Jianhong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and it may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. This section often discusses the context and background of the research, and it may reference datasets indirectly. However, it appears that this section primarily focuses on the theoretical aspects of ad hoc teamwork and does not specify any datasets.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, there is a specific section that outlines the datasets used for experiments. I will check for any headings that indicate such a section, such as "Datasets," "Experimental Setup," or "Methodology." 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two environments used for their experiments: **Level-based Foraging (LBF)** and **Wolfpack**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather experimental environments. I will note these environments as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or environments that the authors might have used. If the authors refer to any datasets in their experiments, they should provide full citations in this section.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites the following works that may be relevant to the datasets or environments used:

1. Rahman, M. A., Hopner, N., Christianos, F., & Albrecht, S. V. (2021). Towards open ad hoc teamwork using graph-based policy learning. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8776–8786. PMLR.

2. Kalyanakrishnan, S., Liu, Y., & Stone, P. (2007). Half field offense in robocup soccer: A multiagent reinforcement learning case study. In RoboCup 2006: Robot Soccer World Cup X 10, pp. 72–85. Springer.

These references provide context for the environments used in the experiments but do not specify datasets in the traditional sense.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets or environments mentioned in the paper:

- **Level-based Foraging (LBF)**: An experimental environment used for testing the proposed algorithms.
- **Wolfpack**: Another experimental environment utilized in the research.

Since these environments are not traditional datasets, I will note that the paper does not provide specific datasets with full citations but rather focuses on experimental environments relevant to the research.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the environments and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
