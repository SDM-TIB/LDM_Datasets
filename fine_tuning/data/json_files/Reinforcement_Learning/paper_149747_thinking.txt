To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Efficient Kernelized Q-Learning" by Shuang Liu and Hao Su, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for testing or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or characteristics of the data.

In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their algorithm on a suite of classic control tasks provided in **OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that the datasets used for evaluation are likely related to these environments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to specific environments from OpenAI Gym, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these environments.

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The paper mentions that the experiments were conducted using classic control tasks available in OpenAI Gym. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. **Classic Control Tasks**: The specific tasks mentioned include **MountainCar**, **Pendulum**, **Acrobot**, and **CartPole**. These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym framework, and they do not have separate citations since they are included within the OpenAI Gym documentation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
