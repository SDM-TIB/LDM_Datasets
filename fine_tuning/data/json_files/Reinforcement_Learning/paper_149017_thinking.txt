To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fatigued Random Walks in Hypergraphs" by José Devezas and Sérgio Nunes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors mention the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia Collection**, which is described as an XML collection of Wikipedia articles annotated with entity classes from the YAGO ontology. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **references section** or throughout the paper. The authors may cite other works that describe datasets or provide context for their research.

In the **references section**, I will locate the full citation for the **INEX 2009 Wikipedia Collection**. The citation is as follows:
> Paavo Arvola, Shlomo Geva, Jaap Kamps, Ralf Schenkel, Andrew Trotman, and Johanna Vainio. *Overview of the INEX 2010 Ad Hoc Track*. In Comparative Evaluation of Focused Retrieval - 9th International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX 2010, Vugh, The Netherlands, December 13-15, 2010, Revised Selected Papers. 1–32. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23577-1_1

Now, I will summarize the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **INEX 2009 Wikipedia Collection**: An XML collection of Wikipedia articles annotated with over 5,800 entity classes from the YAGO ontology, containing over 2.6 million articles.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
