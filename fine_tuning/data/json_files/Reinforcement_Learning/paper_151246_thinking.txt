To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning to Maximize Wind Turbine Energy Generation" by Daniel Solera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup and validation scenarios. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used for training and testing the reinforcement learning models. 

In the methodology, the authors mention using **real wind data measured by NRELâ€™s M2 tower** for validation. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for the experiments. I will look for details about this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was used in the study.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss any additional datasets or provide insights into the performance metrics derived from the datasets used. 

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the NREL M2 tower dataset, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the NREL M2 tower dataset is:
> D. Jager and A. Andreas. NREL National Wind Technology Center (NWTC): M2 tower; Boulder, Colorado (data). http://dx.doi.org/10.5439/1052222, 1996. NREL Report No. DA-5500-56489.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
