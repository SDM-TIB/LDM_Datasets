To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Rhoticity of /ɹ/ in Speech Sound Disorder using Age-and-Sex Normalized Formants" by Nina R. Benway et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **PERCEPT-R Corpus** for detecting fully rhotic vs. derhotic /ɹ/, indicating that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, specifically **section 3.1 (Corpus Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **PERCEPT-R Corpus v2.2.2**. This section describes the dataset's characteristics, including the number of labeled utterances and the context in which the data was collected. It states that the corpus consists of single-word citation speech audio recorded during clinical trials of children with speech sound disorders.

I will also check **section 3.2 (Dataset Design for Clinical Replicability)**, which discusses how the dataset was structured for training, validation, and testing. This section provides insights into how the data was processed and the criteria for selecting participants, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

After gathering the necessary details about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the **PERCEPT-R Corpus**. The citation is provided in reference [6]:

- Benway, N.R., Preston, J.L., Hitchcock, E.R., Rose, Y., Salekin, A., Liang, W., and McAllister, T. (in press). Reproducible speech research with the artificial-intelligence-ready percept corpora. *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I took to extract the dataset from the paper are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the main dataset.
2. Review the methods section for detailed information about the dataset's characteristics and structure.
3. Locate the full citation in the references section to ensure proper documentation.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the **PERCEPT-R Corpus**.
