To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniform State Abstraction For Reinforcement Learning" by John Burden and Daniel Kudenko, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental domains sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may also discuss the context of the research without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Domains)**, where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets or environments that serve as datasets for their experiments. The paper mentions three environments: **Mountain Car**, **Continuous Puddle World**, and **Catcher**. I will take note of these environments as they are critical to the experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Mountain Car)**, the authors describe the environment in detail, including the state-space and the reward structure. I will summarize the key points about this environment, as it serves as a dataset for the experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Continuous Puddle World)**, the authors provide a similar description of this environment, detailing its state-space and dynamics. I will extract relevant information about this environment as well.

In **section 4.3 (Catcher)**, the authors describe the final environment used in their experiments. I will summarize the details provided here too.

After identifying the environments, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. If the authors reference foundational papers or datasets that describe these environments, I will include those citations.

For the environments mentioned, I will compile the following information:

1. **Mountain Car**: This environment is commonly used in reinforcement learning research. The citation for the original paper describing this environment is:
   > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press.

2. **Continuous Puddle World**: This environment is also a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. The citation for the original paper describing this environment is:
   > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press.

3. **Catcher**: This environment is less commonly referenced but is still relevant. If the authors do not provide a specific citation, I will note that it is a custom environment used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for each environment. This will ensure that the extracted information is complete and ready for further processing or review.
