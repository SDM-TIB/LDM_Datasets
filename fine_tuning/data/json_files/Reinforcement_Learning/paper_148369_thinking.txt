To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Safer Self-Driving Through Great PAIN" by Piyush Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA simulation environment, which suggests that the dataset used for training the models may be synthetic data generated within this environment.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe various scenarios for training and evaluating the protagonist and adversary agents. They mention that the training occurs in the CARLA simulation environment, which is an important detail as it indicates that the data used for training is likely derived from this simulator.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the CARLA simulator or any datasets that might have been used in conjunction with it. The CARLA simulator is referenced in the paper, and I will need to ensure I capture the full citation for it.

The CARLA simulator is cited as follows:
- **CARLA**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1–16).

Additionally, I will note that the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the CARLA simulation environment, which is used to generate the training data for the agents.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset used in the research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **CARLA Simulation Environment**: Used for generating synthetic training data for the self-driving agents.

The full citation for the CARLA simulator is:
- Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (pp. 1–16).

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset details in the required format.
