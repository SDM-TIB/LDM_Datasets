To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negative Label Guided OOD Detection with Pretrained Vision-Language Models" by Feng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, NegLabel, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various OOD detection benchmarks. This suggests that there are specific datasets used for evaluation, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will focus on any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet-1k OOD benchmark** for their experiments. This benchmark is widely recognized and consists of the ImageNet dataset as in-distribution data and several other datasets as out-of-distribution data.

The paper lists the following datasets used for OOD detection:
1. **iNaturalist**: A dataset for species classification and detection.
2. **SUN**: A dataset for scene recognition.
3. **Places**: A dataset for scene recognition that includes a wide variety of environments.
4. **Textures**: A dataset focused on texture recognition.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alexander Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge J. Belongie. *The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For **SUN**, the citation is:
  > Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Krista A. Ehinger, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *SUN database: Large-scale scene recognition from abbey to zoo*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010.

- For **Textures**, the citation is:
  > Mircea Cimpoi, Subhransu Maji, Iasonas Kokkinos, Sammy Mohamed, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Describing textures in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. Each dataset will include its name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic citation practices.
