To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-Context Explainers: Harnessing LLMs for Explaining Black Box Models" by Nicholas Kroeger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting extensive analysis with approaches on **real-world tabular and text datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention analyzing **five real-world tabular datasets**: 

1. **Blood Dataset**: This dataset comprises 4 attributes of 748 donors to a blood transfusion service from Taiwan, with the task of predicting whether patients return for another donation.

2. **Recidivism Dataset**: This dataset contains criminal records and demographic features for 6,172 defendants released on bail at U.S. state courts, aiming to classify defendants into bail or no bail categories.

3. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset includes demographic, education, employment, personal, and financial features for 45,222 individuals, with the task of predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year.

4. **Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes financial and demographic data from credit card users at a bank, predicting whether an individual will default on their payment.

5. **HELOC Dataset**: This dataset comprises financial attributes from anonymized applications submitted by real homeowners, predicting whether applicants will repay their HELOC within 2 years.

Additionally, the authors mention using **three sentiment datasets**: 

1. **Amazon Reviews Dataset**: This dataset contains textual reviews from users describing their experiences with products, with the task of predicting sentiment.

2. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset consists of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database, predicting sentiment based on the content.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset includes user-generated reviews from Yelp, predicting sentiment based on the reviews.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **Blood Dataset**:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
