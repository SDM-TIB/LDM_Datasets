To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdsorbRL: Deep Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Catalysts Design" by Romain Lacombe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model using the **Open Catalyst 2020** and **Materials Project** datasets, which indicates that these are key datasets for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In the **Related Work** section, the authors discuss the **Open Catalyst Project**, which leads me to believe that the datasets are likely described in detail in the subsequent sections.

In the **Dataset and Features** section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20)**: This dataset contains 1.3 million molecular relaxations and results from over 260 million DFT calculations. It is used to train machine learning models for predicting adsorption energies.

2. **Materials Project**: This is an open-access database that provides pre-computed properties for a large number of candidate catalysts. The authors utilize the Catalysis Explorer from this database to obtain adsorption energies for various catalysts.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References** section of the paper:

- For the **Open Catalyst 2020** dataset, the citation is:
  > Lowik Chanussot, Abhishek Das, Siddharth Goyal, Thibaut Lavril, Muhammed Shuaibi, Morgane Riviere, Kevin Tran, Javier Heras-Domingo, Caleb Ho, Weihua Hu, Aini Palizhati, Anuroop Sriram, Brandon Wood, Junwoong Yoon, Devi Parikh, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Zachary Ulissi. *Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset and community challenges*. ACS Catalysis, 11(10):6059â€“6072, May 2021.

- For the **Materials Project**, the citation is:
  > Anubhav Jain, Shyue Ping Ong, Geoffroy Hautier, Wei Chen, William Davidson Richards, Stephen Dacek, Shreyas Cholia, Dan Gunter, David Skinner, Gerbrand Ceder, and Kristin A. Persson. *Commentary: The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation*. APL Materials, 1(1):011002, 07 2013.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in systematically extracting and presenting the relevant datasets from the research paper.
