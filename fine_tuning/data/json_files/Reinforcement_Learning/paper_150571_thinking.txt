To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Machine Learning based on Functional ANOVA Framework" by Linwei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details the datasets used for training and testing the models.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of simulated and real datasets to compare selected machine learning algorithms. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. In this paper, the authors mention using **simulated datasets** for their experiments, specifically noting that they simulated datasets with varying sample sizes and correlation levels. They also mention using a **home mortgage dataset** for real-world application.

I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: The paper describes multiple simulated datasets created for the purpose of comparing the performance of different algorithms. However, specific names or citations for these datasets are not provided, as they are generated for the study.

2. **Home Mortgage Dataset**: The authors describe a dataset related to residential mortgage accounts, which includes over 50 predictors and a sample size of 1 million observations. This dataset is crucial for the application of their proposed methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the simulated datasets do not have formal citations, I will focus on the home mortgage dataset.

The citation for the home mortgage dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can summarize its details based on the information given:

- **Home Mortgage Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether a loan will be in trouble based on various predictors, including macroeconomic variables and loan characteristics. The dataset is derived from Wells Fargo's internal data.

Since the home mortgage dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is an internal dataset from Wells Fargo.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant citations or notes regarding their sources.
