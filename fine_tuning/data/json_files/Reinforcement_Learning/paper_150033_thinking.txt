To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Utility of Explainable AI in Ad Hoc Human-Machine Teaming" by Rohan Paleja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted. This section is crucial as it often details the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including any specific tasks or environments they were derived from.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Microsoft Malmo Minecraft AI Project** as the environment for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset is related to the Minecraft game, which serves as a platform for testing human-machine teaming scenarios.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance metrics or outcomes related to the datasets. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were used and their relevance to the study's findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, the Microsoft Malmo Minecraft AI Project is a well-known dataset, and I will ensure to provide its complete citation.

The citation for the Microsoft Malmo Minecraft AI Project is:
> Matthew Johnson, Katja Hofmann, Tim Hutton, and David Bignell. *The Malmo Platform for Artificial Intelligence Experimentation*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2016.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data sources that underpin the study's findings.
