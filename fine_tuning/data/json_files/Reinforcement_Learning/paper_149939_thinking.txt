To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Path Reasoning for Counterfactual Explainable Recommendation" by Xiangmeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their proposed method on three publicly available datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the three datasets:

1. **Last-FM**: A music listening dataset that records user-item interactions.
2. **Amazon-book**: A widely used book recommendation dataset, which has been mapped to Freebase entities.
3. **Yelp2018**: A business recommendation dataset that includes local business information.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **Last-FM**, the citation is:
  > Hu, Y., & Koren, Y. (2008). "Collaborative filtering with privacy." In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pp. 125-132.

- For **Amazon-book**, the citation is:
  > McAuley, J., & Leskovec, J. (2013). "From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews." In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pp. 897-908.

- For **Yelp2018**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. (2018). "Yelp Dataset." Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
