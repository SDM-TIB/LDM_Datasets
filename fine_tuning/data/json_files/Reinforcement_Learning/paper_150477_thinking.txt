To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Machine Learning-Accelerated Seed Treatment by Nanomaterials for Environmental Stress Alleviation" by Hengjie Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of **56 seed nanopriming treatments** and mentions the evaluation of their effects on stress resistance, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these treatments.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly focusing on the **Seed nanopriming treatment** and **Biological endpoint collection** subsections. Here, the authors describe the treatments and the biological endpoints measured, which may indicate the presence of a dataset. I will note any specific treatments, their concentrations, and the biological endpoints collected.

In the **Results** section, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the data collected from the experiments. For instance, the authors mention the **stress resistance index (SRI)** and the performance of different nanopriming treatments under various stress conditions. This section may contain valuable information about the datasets used.

Additionally, I will check the **Supplementary Materials** for any datasets referenced, as the authors mention a **Supplementary dataset S1** and **Supplementary dataset S2**. These supplementary materials often contain detailed datasets that are not included in the main text.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors reference specific studies or datasets related to the nanopriming treatments or the biological endpoints, I will ensure to include those citations.

For the datasets I identify, I will summarize the key details, such as the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation. For instance, if I find that the **ZnO nanopriming treatment** is part of a dataset, I will note its concentration and the biological endpoints measured.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, complete with proper citations for each.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
