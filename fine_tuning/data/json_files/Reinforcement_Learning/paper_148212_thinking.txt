To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighborhood Cognition Consistent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Hangyu Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments on several challenging tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to confirm their names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experimental evaluations** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In the **experimental evaluations** section, the authors mention three tasks: **packet routing**, **Wi-Fi configuration**, and **Google football player control**. I will look for any specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to existing environments rather than specific datasets. For example, they mention using the **packet routing tasks** from the work of Mao et al. (2019) and the **Google football** environment from Kurach et al. (2019). This indicates that I should cite these papers as they provide the datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the referenced works:

1. For the **packet routing tasks**, the citation is:
   > Mao, H., Zhang, Z., Xiao, Z., & Gong, Z. (2019). Modelling the dynamic joint policy of teammates with attention multi-agent DDPG. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (pp. 1108â€“1116). International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

2. For the **Google football environment**, the citation is:
   > Kurach, K., Raichuk, A., Stanczyk, P., Zajac, M., Bachem, O., Espeholt, L., Riquelme, C., Vincent, D., Michalski, M., Bousquet, O., et al. (2019). Google research football: A novel reinforcement learning environment. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.11180.

Since the paper does not introduce new datasets but utilizes existing environments, I will ensure to note that the datasets are derived from these references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset as identified in the paper.
