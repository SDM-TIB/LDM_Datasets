To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Exploration with Optimistic Actor-Critic" by Kamil Ciosek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5 in this case) closely, as this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that the authors provide.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks**. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these benchmarks, which I need to identify.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to specific datasets, they may provide citations for the original papers or sources where these datasets can be accessed.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper mentions the **MuJoCo** datasets, I will look for the original source of these datasets and provide the citation accordingly.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
