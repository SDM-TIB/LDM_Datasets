To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demonstrations and Adaptive Exploration for Efficient and Stable Multi-step Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning" by Xintong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. However, it does mention conducting experiments on various tasks, which suggests that datasets might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or environments used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges in reinforcement learning but does not explicitly name datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the environments or datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Mini-grid** and **Pybullet Multigoal environments** for their experiments. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their research.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the experiments conducted in these environments, which further confirms their use.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Mini-grid environment**, the citation is:
   > M. Chevalier-Boisvert, L. Willems, and S. Pal. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for openai gym*. Available at: https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

2. For the **Pybullet Multigoal environments**, the citation is:
   > X. Yang, Z. Ji, J. Wu, and Y.-K. Lai. *An open-source multi-goal reinforcement learning environment for robotic manipulation with pybullet*. In *Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems*, Springer International Publishing, 2021, pp. 14â€“24, ISBN: 978-3-030-89177-0.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Mini-grid environment**: A minimalistic grid-world environment designed for reinforcement learning tasks, providing a variety of scenarios for agents to learn and adapt.
- **Pybullet Multigoal environments**: A set of environments for robotic manipulation tasks, allowing for multi-goal reinforcement learning experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
