To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Finite-Time Analysis of Distributed Q-Learning" by Han-Dong Lim and Donghwan Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the study, and any mention of datasets here will be crucial.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets used in previous studies. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are relevant to their work.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or data collection methods. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors mention any datasets in relation to their findings or analyses. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used in their experiments.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" used for training, I would document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: XYZ Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 10,000 samples for training reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Citation**: Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
