To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Neural Mapping: Learning An Implicit Scene Representation from Sequential Observations" by Zike Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets that the authors used to validate their approach. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any detailed descriptions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **ICL-NUIM Dataset**: This dataset is used for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed method. It is a synthetic dataset designed for benchmarking RGB-D visual odometry and 3D reconstruction.

2. **TUM Dataset**: This is a real-world dataset used for additional qualitative evaluations. It is commonly used in the robotics and computer vision communities for testing algorithms related to visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I found are:

- For the **ICL-NUIM Dataset**:
  > Ankur Handa, Thomas Whelan, John McDonald, and Andrew J Davison. *A benchmark for rgb-d visual odometry, 3d reconstruction and slam*. In IEEE Intl. Conf. on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2014.

- For the **TUM Dataset**:
  > JÃ¼rgen Sturm, Nikolas Engelhard, Felix Endres, Wolfram Burgard, and Daniel Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of rgb-d slam systems*. In IEEE/RSJ Intl. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
