To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Cognitive Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network Node Management in an LEO-based Satellite Constellation," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any mentions of simulation environments or datasets that were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **DtnSim simulation platform** for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset is likely generated within this simulation environment rather than being sourced from an external dataset. I will note this as it is crucial for understanding the context of the data used.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the DtnSim platform or any other datasets that might have been referenced. The citation for DtnSim is:
- **DtnSim**: msancheznet, “dtnsim,” https://github.com/msancheznet/dtnsim, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any external datasets but relies on a simulation platform, I will summarize the dataset information accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DtnSim platform as the primary source of data used in the experiments. This will provide a clear reference for anyone reviewing the datasets utilized in this research.
