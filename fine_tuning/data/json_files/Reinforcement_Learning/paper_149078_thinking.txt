To extract datasets from the research paper titled "This Looks Like That... Does it? Shortcomings of Latent Space Prototype Interpretability in Deep Networks" by Adrian Hoffmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of prototype-based reasoning and mention that they will investigate the performance of an image classification network called ProtoPNet. This suggests that there may be datasets used for training and testing this network.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset** for training their ProtoPNets. This dataset is crucial for understanding the experiments conducted in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors provide insights into the performance of their models, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they reaffirm the use of the **CUB-200-2011 dataset** for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUB-200-2011 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, I will create an entry for it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation as required.
