To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning based Model-free On-line Dynamic Multi-Microgrid Formation to Enhance Resilience" by Jin Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their research. This section often provides context and may reference previous works that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the systems or datasets they used to validate their proposed methods. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets, especially if the authors present performance metrics based on specific datasets. This section could confirm the datasets used and provide additional context about their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to power systems or microgrid simulations, possibly including specific datasets for the 7-bus and IEEE 123-bus systems mentioned in the case studies.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
