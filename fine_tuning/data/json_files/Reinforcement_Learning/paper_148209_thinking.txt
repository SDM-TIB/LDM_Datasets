To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversary A3C for Robust Reinforcement Learning" by Zhaoyuan Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the performance of the AR-A3C algorithm in both simulations and real-world experiments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the environments and setups used for testing their algorithm. Here, they mention using the **Mujoco pendulum model** for simulations, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in this section or in the context of the experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Environment Settings)**, the authors specify that they wrapped the maxon motor controller into an environment using ROS (Robot Operating System) and describe the state representation and reward function. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset here, but the Mujoco environment is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning research.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the Mujoco physics engine, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The citation for Mujoco is:

- **MuJoCo**: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of adversarial training or other experiments. If the authors refer to any specific datasets used for training or evaluation, I will ensure to note those down along with their citations.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Look for full citations in the references for any identified datasets.
4. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for review.
