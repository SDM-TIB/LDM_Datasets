To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-set reduction to efficiently solve the graph partitioning problem with the genetic algorithm" by Ali Chaouche and Menouar Boulif, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the graph partitioning problem and the use of genetic algorithms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to see if any specific datasets are referenced. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using various graph instances, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. Instead, they mention the characteristics of the graph instances used in their experiments, such as the number of edges and vertices.

Since the paper does not provide any formal datasets with citations, I will note that the authors refer to three graph instances with specific features, but these are not standard datasets that can be cited. Instead, they appear to be custom instances created for the purpose of their experiments.

I will summarize the information about the graph instances as follows:

1. **Graph Instance 1**: 
   - Number of edges: 55
   - Number of vertices: 15

2. **Graph Instance 2**: 
   - Number of edges: 45
   - Number of vertices: 30

3. **Graph Instance 3**: 
   - Number of edges: 1980
   - Number of vertices: 121

Since these instances do not have formal citations or are not widely recognized datasets, I will note that in the output. 

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that these graph instances are not standard datasets with citations but rather specific instances used for the experiments in this paper.

In conclusion, while I have identified the graph instances used in the experiments, there are no formal datasets with citations to extract from this paper.
