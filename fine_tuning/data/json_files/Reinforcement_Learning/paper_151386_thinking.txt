To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing Adversarial Examples for Bias Mitigation and Accuracy Enhancement" by Pushkar Shukla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions validating the approach using "CelebA" and "LFW" datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In the **method** section, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of "CelebA" and "LFW" datasets for validation. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their experiments.

In the **results** section, the authors provide quantitative comparisons of their method using these datasets, which further emphasizes their importance. They discuss the performance metrics achieved on both datasets, indicating that they are used for evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed method.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

2. For the **LFW dataset**, the citation is:
   > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, October 2007.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
