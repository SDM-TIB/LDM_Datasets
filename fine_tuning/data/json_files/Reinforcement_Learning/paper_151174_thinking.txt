To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Fully Differentiable Model for Unsupervised Singing Voice Separation" by Gaël Richard, Pierre Chouteau, and Bernardo Torres, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections related to datasets and experiments**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will focus on the sections that explicitly mention datasets.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four databases:

1. **Bach Chorales-Barbershop Quartet (BCBSQ)**: This dataset is a combination of Bach Chorales and Barbershop Quartet recordings, containing 26+22 songs performed by a quartet of singers. It is used for training and has a total duration of 91 minutes and 20 seconds for training and 9 minutes and 10 seconds for validation.

2. **BC1Song**: This is a reduced dataset that includes a single Bach Chorales song, with a total duration of 2 minutes and 40 seconds for training and 2 minutes and 20 seconds for validation.

3. **Choral Singing Dataset (CSD)**: This public dataset consists of recordings of three songs performed by an SATB choir, with 16 singers recorded separately. It is used only for testing.

4. **Cantoría**: This dataset consists of 11 songs performed by a professional SATB choir and is used to test the generalization ability of the proposed methods.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility.

- For **Bach Chorales**, the citation is:
  > PG Music. *The Bach Chorales*. Available: https://www.pgmusic.com/bachchorales.htm.

- For **Barbershop Quartet**, the citation is:
  > PG Music. *The Barbershop Quartet*. Available: https://www.pgmusic.com/barbershopquartet.htm.

- For **Choral Singing Dataset (CSD)**, the citation is:
  > Cuesta, H., Gómez, E., Martorell, A., & Loáiciga, F. (2018). *Analysis of intonation in unison choir singing*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition.

- For **Cantoría**, the citation is:
  > Cuesta, H., & Gómez, E. (2022). *Cantoría Dataset*. Available: https://zenodo.org/record/5851070.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
