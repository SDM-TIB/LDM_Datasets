To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Heuristics over Large Graphs via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Sahil Manchanda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive experiments on real graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list several datasets, including:

1. **Brightkite (BK)**: This dataset contains 214K nodes and 1.5 billion edges.
2. **Twitter-ego (TW-ew)**: This dataset has 58.2K nodes and 1.8 billion edges.
3. **Gowalla (GO)**: This dataset consists of 81.3K nodes and 1.5 billion edges.
4. **YouTube (YT)**: This dataset includes 1.7 million nodes and 5.9 million edges.
5. **StackOverflow (Stack)**: This dataset has 196.5K nodes and 3.07 million edges.
6. **Orkut**: This dataset contains 950.3K nodes and 41.6 million edges.
7. **Twitter (TW)**: This dataset has 1.13 million nodes and 65.6 million edges.
8. **Friendster (FS)**: This dataset consists of 2.99 million nodes and 117.1 million edges.

The authors also mention that they used synthetic random bipartite graphs (BP) generated from the S2V-DQN model for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the SNAP repository for the datasets, which is a well-known source for network datasets.

The full citation for the datasets from the SNAP repository is:
> Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will document the following datasets with their respective citations:

1. **Brightkite (BK)**: 214K nodes, 1.5 billion edges.
2. **Twitter-ego (TW-ew)**: 58.2K nodes, 1.8 billion edges.
3. **Gowalla (GO)**: 81.3K nodes, 1.5 billion edges.
4. **YouTube (YT)**: 1.7 million nodes, 5.9 million edges.
5. **StackOverflow (Stack)**: 196.5K nodes, 3.07 million edges.
6. **Orkut**: 950.3K nodes, 41.6 million edges.
7. **Twitter (TW)**: 1.13 million nodes, 65.6 million edges.
8. **Friendster (FS)**: 2.99 million nodes, 117.1 million edges.
9. **Synthetic Random Bipartite Graphs (BP)**: Generated from S2V-DQN.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset information is clearly structured and ready for further processing or review.
