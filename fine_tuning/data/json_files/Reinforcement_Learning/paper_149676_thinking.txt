To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conquering Ghosts: Relation Learning for Information Reliability" by Kefan Jin, Xingyao Han, and Hongye Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA platform for simulations, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this platform.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods. The introduction discusses challenges in autonomous driving and mentions the use of various agents in the CARLA environment, indicating that data was collected during simulations.

I will then look into the **implementation** section, specifically focusing on the **data collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they utilized CARLAâ€™s autopilots to generate a dataset consisting of 8000 training samples and 1000 evaluation samples. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the types of vehicles involved.

In the **experiments** section, I will check for any additional datasets or variations of the dataset used for training and evaluation. The authors mention different models trained with varying numbers of ghost vehicles and normal vehicles, which may imply different configurations of the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will consult the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the CARLA platform is widely recognized, I will look for its official citation.

The relevant dataset information I have identified includes:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset was generated using the CARLA platform, which includes 8000 training samples and 1000 evaluation samples with various configurations of normal and ghost vehicles.

The citation for the CARLA platform is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
