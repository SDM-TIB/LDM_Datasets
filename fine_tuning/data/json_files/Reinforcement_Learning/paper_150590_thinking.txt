To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IQL-TD-MPC: Implicit Q-Learning for Hierarchical Model Predictive Control" by Rohan Chitnis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss the performance of their method on **D4RL benchmark tasks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention several specific datasets in the context of their experiments, particularly in the tables that summarize the results.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I will identify the datasets listed in the tables, which include:

1. **antmaze-umaze-v2**
2. **antmaze-umaze-diverse-v2**
3. **antmaze-medium-play-v2**
4. **antmaze-medium-diverse-v2**
5. **antmaze-large-play-v2**
6. **antmaze-large-diverse-v2**
7. **antmaze-ultra-play-v0**
8. **antmaze-ultra-diverse-v0**
9. **maze2d-umaze-v1**
10. **maze2d-medium-v1**
11. **maze2d-large-v1**
12. **halfcheetah-medium-v2**
13. **halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2**
14. **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the D4RL benchmark datasets were used, which are well-documented in the literature. The citation for the D4RL benchmark is:

- For the D4RL benchmark:
  > Fu, E., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I will document the datasets used in the paper along with their citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the research.
