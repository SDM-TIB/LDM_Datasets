To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PBCS: Efficient Exploration and Exploitation Using a Synergy between Reinforcement Learning and Motion Planning" by Guillaume Matheron et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss related work and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to the research.

Then, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly any subsections that describe the experimental setup or the environments used for testing. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **experimental results** section, where the authors typically present their findings based on the datasets. They may provide performance metrics or comparisons that further confirm the datasets used in their experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to reinforcement learning or motion planning, as these are the primary focus of the research. 

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as follows:

- If a dataset is mentioned, I will write down its name and any relevant details provided in the paper.
- I will then locate the corresponding citation in the references section to ensure I have the complete and accurate reference for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
