To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shaped Policy Search for Evolutionary Strategies using Waypoints" by Kiran Lekkala and Laurent Itti, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Carla driving simulator** and the **UR5 robotic arm simulator**, indicating that these simulators may serve as datasets or environments for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** in detail. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the specific tasks performed in each simulator. In the Carla driving simulator, they mention that the agent navigates from a source to a destination location, which suggests that the simulator provides a dataset of trajectories or experiences generated during the navigation task. They also specify that the agent receives a 38-dimensional state and outputs a 2-dimensional action vector, which further indicates the structured nature of the data involved.

In the section discussing the UR5 robotic arm, the authors describe the task of moving the end-effector to a goal coordinate, which implies that this simulator also generates a dataset of actions and states relevant to robotic manipulation tasks.

Now, I will look for any explicit references to datasets or papers that describe these simulators in the **References section**. 

1. For the **Carla driving simulator**, the citation is:
   > Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. "CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator". In: 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, CoRL 2017, Mountain View, California, USA, November 13-15, 2017, Proceedings. Vol. 78. Proceedings of Machine Learning Research. PMLR, 2017, pp. 1â€“16. URL: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v78/dosovitskiy17a.html.

2. For the **UR5 robotic arm simulator**, the citation is:
   > Matteo Lucchi et al. "robo-gym - An Open Source Toolkit for Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning on Real and Simulated Robots". In: CoRR abs/2007.02753 (2020). arXiv: 2007.02753. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02753.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
