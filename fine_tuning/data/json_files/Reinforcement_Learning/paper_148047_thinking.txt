To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Span Acoustic Modelling using Raw Waveform Signals" by P. von Platen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **CHiME4** and **AMI** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their evaluation process. In **section 4.1**, they provide details about the **CHiME4 dataset**, stating that it consists of 18 hours of training data recorded by a close-talking microphone. This section confirms that CHiME4 is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **AMI dataset**, which includes 78.2 hours of speech from individual headset microphones. This section further confirms that AMI is another dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CHiME4 dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Vincent, S. Watanabe, A.A. Nugraha, J. Barker, R. Marxer. "An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition." *Computer Speech & Language*, pp. 535â€“557, 2017.

- For the **AMI dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Carletta, S. Ashby, S. Bourban, M. Flynn, M. Guillemot, T. Hain, J. Kadlec, V. Karaiskos, W. Kraaij, M. Kronenthal. "The AMI meeting corpus: A pre-announcement." *Proc. MLMI*, Edinburgh, 2005.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
