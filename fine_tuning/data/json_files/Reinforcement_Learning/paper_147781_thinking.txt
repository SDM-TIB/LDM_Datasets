To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negative Update Intervals in Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Gregory Palmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss the **Apprentice Firemen Game (AFG)**, which is a new environment they created for their experiments. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or environments that can be classified as datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe the **Apprentice Firemen Game (AFG)** as a new environment used for their experiments. However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or external datasets that they utilized. Instead, they created their own experimental setup.

Since the AFG is a custom environment rather than a dataset in the traditional sense, I will note that down. The paper does not provide a citation for a dataset since it is an original contribution of the authors.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or environments that might have influenced their work. However, it appears that the references primarily cite foundational works in multi-agent reinforcement learning and do not refer to specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Apprentice Firemen Game (AFG)**: This is a custom environment created by the authors for their experiments in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is not a publicly available dataset, and thus does not have a citation.

Since there are no traditional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information clearly, ensuring that I highlight the original contribution of the authors without any external dataset citations.
