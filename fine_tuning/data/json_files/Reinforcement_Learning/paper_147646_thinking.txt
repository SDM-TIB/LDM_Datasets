To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified View of Entropy-Regularized Markov Decision Processes" by Gergely Neu, Vicenç Gómez, and Anders Jonsson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will review it to confirm which datasets were used in the experiments and how they were utilized. This section often provides insights into the datasets' relevance to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the correct citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "OpenAI Gym" dataset, I would look for its citation, which might be formatted as follows:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
