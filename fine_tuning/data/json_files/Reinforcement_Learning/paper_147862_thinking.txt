To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reachability and Differential based Heuristics for Solving Markov Decision Processes" by Shoubhik Debnath et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention if any datasets were used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any dedicated **Datasets section**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and relevance to the research.

While reading through these sections, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their numerical evaluations, I will record its name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets mentioned in the research.

For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference or further processing, making sure to highlight the importance of proper citation for each dataset used in the research.
