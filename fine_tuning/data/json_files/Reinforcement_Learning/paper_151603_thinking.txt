To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Comparison of Deep RL Algorithms for Mixed Traffic Cooperative Lane-Changing" by Xue Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to dig deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of lane-changing in mixed traffic and the use of DRL approaches. However, they do not specify any datasets here. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the cooperative lane-changing mechanism and the formulation of the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This section may contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training the DRL algorithms. If the authors conducted simulations, they might have used synthetic datasets or specific traffic scenarios, which should be documented.

After reviewing these sections, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations from the **References section**.

Once I identify the datasets, I will compile the necessary information, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Traffic Simulation Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references and document it accordingly.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their full citations, to provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
