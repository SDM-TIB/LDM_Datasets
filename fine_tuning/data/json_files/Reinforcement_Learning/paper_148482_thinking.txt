To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing a CartPole System with Reinforcement Learning - A Tutorial" by Swagat Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on reinforcement learning algorithms for controlling a Cart-Pole system, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on reinforcement learning concepts but still does not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly the part where the author discusses the use of OpenAI Gym. The paper states that OpenAI Gym is used to simulate the Cart-Pole system, which indicates that the environment itself is a key component of the experiments. However, it does not mention any external datasets that were used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **experiments and results** section to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of performance evaluation. The author discusses various reinforcement learning models and their performance but does not specify any datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will look at the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily consist of papers and resources related to reinforcement learning and the OpenAI Gym, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no external datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The primary focus is on the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms using the OpenAI Gym environment, which is a simulation framework rather than a dataset.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset citations to provide. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have extracted their names, descriptions, and full citations accordingly.
