To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactuals for the Future" by Lucius E.J. Bynum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on counterfactuals, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **background and related work sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the context of their research. This section often contains discussions of previous studies and may mention datasets that are relevant to the current work.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their empirical analysis or simulations. If there are tables or figures, I will check them for any dataset-related information.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will carefully review it to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset like the "UCI Machine Learning Repository" or a specific dataset related to social welfare or treatment choice, I will note the full citation as follows:

- For the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the citation might be:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences.

If the authors reference specific datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well, following the same format.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.

Finally, I will review the entire extraction process to ensure that I have not missed any datasets and that all citations are accurate and complete.
