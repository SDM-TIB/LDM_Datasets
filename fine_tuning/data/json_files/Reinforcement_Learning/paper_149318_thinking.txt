To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy UnMixing for Q-Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Chapman Siu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used in prior work or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmark multi-agent environments, which are likely to be the datasets they used for their experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following environments mentioned:

1. **Cooperative Pong**: A multi-agent game where agents (paddles) work together to keep a ball in play. This environment is sourced from the "Butterfly" environments.

2. **Pistonball**: A physics-based cooperative game from the "Butterfly" environments, where agents must coordinate to move a ball to the left wall.

3. **Pursuit**: An environment from the "SISL" set, where pursuer agents aim to capture randomly controlled evader agents.

4. **Waterworld**: A simulation from the "SISL" set, where agents navigate to avoid poison and find food.

5. **Reference**: An environment from the "MPE" set, where agents aim to get closer to target landmarks.

6. **Spread**: Another environment from the "MPE" set, where agents learn to cover landmarks without colliding with each other.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The environments are often associated with specific papers or repositories, which I will need to cite properly.

For the environments mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- **Butterfly environments**: 
  > Justin K Terry, Benjamin Black, Mario Jayakumar, Ananth Hari, Luis Santos, Clemens Dieffendahl, Niall L Williams, Yashas Lokesh, Ryan Sullivan, Caroline Horsch, and Praveen Ravi. *Pettingzoo: Gym for multi-agent reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.14471, 2020.

- **SISL environments**: 
  > Jayesh K Gupta, Maxim Egorov, and Mykel Kochenderfer. *Cooperative multi-agent control using deep reinforcement learning*. In International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pages 66â€“83. Springer, 2017.

- **MPE environments**: 
  > Tabish Rashid, Mikayel Samvelyan, Christian Schroeder De Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *QMIX: Monotonic value function factorisation for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning*. International Conference on Machine Learning, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
