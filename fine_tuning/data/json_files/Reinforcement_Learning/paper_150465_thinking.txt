To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SparDL: Distributed Deep Learning Training with Efficient Sparse Communication" by Minjun Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses the proposed SparDL framework and mentions conducting extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets. The authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for evaluation, which I need to identify.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

4. **House**: A dataset used for regression tasks, specifically for estimating house prices based on various features.

5. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

6. **PTB (Penn Treebank)**: A dataset used for language modeling, consisting of a collection of texts with annotated syntactic structures.

7. **Wikipedia**: A dataset used for various natural language processing tasks, derived from Wikipedia articles.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
