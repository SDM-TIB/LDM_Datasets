To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling the Potential of Counterfactuals Explanations in Employability" by Raphael Mazzine Barbosa de Oliveira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses real data obtained from a public Belgian employment institution (VDAB), which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is proprietary and contains over 12 million job listings from VDAB, which is crucial information. I will note the specifics about the dataset, including its size (1,396,179 rows) and the types of features it includes (skills profiles of job seekers and vacancies).

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one from VDAB, as it is used throughout the paper for various analyses and use cases.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VDAB dataset. Since the dataset is proprietary and the authors do not provide a formal citation for it, I will note that it is sourced from the Vlaamse Dienst voor Arbeidsbemiddeling en Beroepsopleiding (VDAB), a public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. However, I will also mention that the dataset is subject to legal limitations regarding its usage and publication.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **VDAB Dataset**: A proprietary dataset containing over 12 million job listings, with 1,396,179 rows and various features related to job seekers' skills and job vacancies.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and its source.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference.
