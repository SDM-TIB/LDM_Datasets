To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auxiliary Tasks Speed Up Learning PointGoal Navigation" by Joel Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in sample efficiency for PointGoal Navigation, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Gibson dataset** as the environment used for training and evaluation, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Gibson dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xia, F., Zamir, A. R., He, Z., Sax, A., Malik, J., & Savarese, S. (2018). *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In CVPR. Gibson dataset license agreement available at: http://storage.googleapis.com/gibson_material/Agreement_GDS_06-04-18.pdf.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **Matterport3D dataset** in the context of testing their method in a more challenging environment. I will locate its citation in the references section as well:
> Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV). MatterPort3D dataset license available at: http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/matterport/MP_TOS.pdf.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Gibson Dataset**: Used for training and evaluation in photorealistic environments.
   - Citation: Xia, F., Zamir, A. R., He, Z., Sax, A., Malik, J., & Savarese, S. (2018). *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In CVPR. Gibson dataset license agreement available at: http://storage.googleapis.com/gibson_material/Agreement_GDS_06-04-18.pdf.

2. **Matterport3D Dataset**: Used for testing the method in a more challenging environment.
   - Citation: Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV). MatterPort3D dataset license available at: http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/matterport/MP_TOS.pdf.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified output structure for datasets.
