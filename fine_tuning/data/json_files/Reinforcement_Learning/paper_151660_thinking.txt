To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Penetration Testing using A3C, Q-learning and DQN" by Norman Becker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or environments used for training the reinforcement learning agents.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research and may mention any relevant datasets or simulation environments. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the parts discussing the experimental setup, I will look for detailed descriptions of the environments used for training the agents. The authors mention a "Network Attack Simulator (NASim)" and "Penbox," which are crucial for understanding the datasets or environments they utilized. I will note any specific configurations or scenarios that are defined, as these may imply the use of particular datasets.

The **experiments section** will be critical for confirming the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors may provide details about the scenarios they tested, which could indicate the datasets involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to the "Network Attack Simulator (NASim)" or "Penbox," I will ensure to find the original papers or documentation that describe these tools and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
