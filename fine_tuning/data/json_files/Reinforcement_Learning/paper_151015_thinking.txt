To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Lane Merging via Game Theory and Branch Model Predictive Control" by Luyao Zhang, Shaohang Han, and Sergio Grammatico, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed planner is validated using real traffic data, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors mention validating their method using the **INTERACTION dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the INTERACTION dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> W. Zhan, L. Sun, D. Wang, et al. "INTERACTION Dataset: An INTERnational, Adversarial and Cooperative moTION Dataset in Interactive Driving Scenarios with Semantic Maps." arXiv:1910.03088 [cs, eess], Sep. 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **INTERACTION Dataset**: This dataset is used for validating the proposed game-theoretic planner in lane merging scenarios. It includes various interactive driving scenarios with semantic maps, which are essential for understanding vehicle interactions in dense traffic.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
