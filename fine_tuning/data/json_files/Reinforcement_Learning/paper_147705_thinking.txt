To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Discount Deep Reinforcement Learning: Towards New Dynamic Strategies" by Vincent FranÃ§ois-Lavet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning and mentions empirical studies, but does not specify datasets directly. The introduction provides context but also lacks specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the benchmarks they used. In this section, they mention using the **Atari 2600 computer games** as a benchmark for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are related to these games, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

I will look for any specific references to datasets or benchmarks in the text. The authors refer to the benchmark proposed in [1], which is a key reference for the Atari games. I will need to check the **References section** to find the full citation for this benchmark.

In the **References section**, I find the following citation for the Atari games benchmark:
- **Atari Learning Environment**: 
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.4708, 2012.

Since the authors do not mention any other specific datasets or benchmarks, I will conclude that the primary dataset they utilized for their experiments is the Atari Learning Environment.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific benchmarks used.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified benchmark in the References section.

The final dataset entry will include the Atari Learning Environment as the dataset used in their experiments, along with its full citation.
