To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Agents Run Relay Race with Strangers? Generalization of RL to Out-of-Distribution Trajectories" by Li-Cheng Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of reinforcement learning (RL) agents on out-of-distribution states, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of RL environments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments in four Mujoco environments: **Humanoid-v3, Walker2d-v3, Hopper-v3, and Ant-v3**. These environments are standard benchmarks in the RL community, which indicates that they are indeed datasets used for training and testing the RL agents.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these environments. The Mujoco environments are widely recognized, and their citations can be traced back to the original Mujoco paper:

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026–5033, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Humanoid-v3**: A complex environment simulating a humanoid robot.
   - Citation: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033).

2. **Walker2d-v3**: A 2D bipedal walker environment.
   - Citation: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033).

3. **Hopper-v3**: A single-legged hopping robot environment.
   - Citation: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033).

4. **Ant-v3**: A four-legged robot environment.
   - Citation: Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
