To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Surrogate Q-Learning for Autonomous Driving" by Maria Kalweit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **open real highD dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In the paper, they mention that they trained on transitions extracted from the **HighD traffic dataset**, which consists of top-down recordings of German highways. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about the HighD dataset, including that it contains 61 recordings resulting in a total of 147 driving hours. They also mention preprocessing steps and the types of data included, such as vehicle IDs, velocities, lane IDs, and positions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HighD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **HighD Dataset**: 
  > Robert Krajewski, Julian Bock, Laurent Kloeker, and Lutz Eckstein. *The highd dataset: A drone dataset of naturalistic vehicle trajectories on german highways for validation of highly automated driving systems*. In International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pages 2118â€“2125, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings.

I have identified the following dataset used in the research:

1. **HighD Dataset**: This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the proposed method, containing extensive recordings of vehicle trajectories on German highways.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into the required structured format for further processing or review.
