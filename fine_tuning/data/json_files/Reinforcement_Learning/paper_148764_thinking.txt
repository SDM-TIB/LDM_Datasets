To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Independent Learning All You Need in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge?" by Christian Schroeder de Witt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, which is a well-known benchmark suite for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I will then look for any specific details about the datasets used within the **experiments section** or any other relevant sections. The paper discusses various maps from the SMAC suite, indicating that these maps serve as the datasets for their experiments. The authors mention specific maps such as **"corridor," "6h vs 8z," "3m,"** and others, which are part of the SMAC environment.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SMAC benchmark is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to include the complete citation for it.

The citation for the SMAC benchmark is:
> Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim G. J. Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip H. S. Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. arXiv:1902.04043 [cs, stat], December 2019.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific details about the datasets used.
3. Identify the SMAC benchmark and its associated maps as the datasets.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the SMAC benchmark from the references section.
5. Prepare the dataset entries for structured output.
