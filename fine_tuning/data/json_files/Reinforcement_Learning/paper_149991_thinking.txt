To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plug-and-Play Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Policy Synthesis for Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation" by Siyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for offline evaluation, specifically:

1. **MovieLens-100k**: A dataset based on user ratings for movies, collected from the MovieLens website. It contains 100,000 ratings from users, with each user having at least 20 ratings.

2. **MovieLens-1M**: Similar to the 100k dataset but larger, containing 1 million ratings. Each user is assigned five features, and each movie has 23 features with 19 different genres.

3. **Douban-Book**: A dataset containing user ratings and book information from the Douban website, which is known for being more sparse than MovieLens.

4. **BookCrossing**: Another book dataset that includes user ratings and book information, also more sparse compared to MovieLens.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-100k**:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

- For **MovieLens-1M**:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

- For **Douban-Book**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
