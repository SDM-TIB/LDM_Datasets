To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepTraffic: Crowdsourced Hyperparameter Tuning of Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems for Multi-Agent Dense Traffic Navigation" by Lex Fridman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the DeepTraffic simulation and mentions the crowdsourced hyperparameter tuning competition, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the competition.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Network Performance and Exploration)**, where the authors discuss insights gained from the crowdsourced submissions. Here, they mention that the competition has led to the collection of a dataset referred to as the **"Human-Based Hyperparameter Tuning" dataset**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that has been created from the competition submissions.

In the **conclusion**, the authors reiterate the goal of making deep reinforcement learning accessible and highlight the dataset derived from the hyperparameter tuning process. This confirms the existence of the dataset and its relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the competition and not a standalone publication, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is associated with the DeepTraffic competition hosted at MIT.

The relevant dataset information I have gathered is as follows:

1. **Human-Based Hyperparameter Tuning Dataset**: This dataset consists of traces from the crowdsourced hyperparameter tuning process during the DeepTraffic competition, which involved over 24,000 submissions.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will reference it as follows:
> Fridman, L., Terwilliger, J., & Jenik, B. (2018). *DeepTraffic: Crowdsourced Hyperparameter Tuning of Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems for Multi-Agent Dense Traffic Navigation*. In Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2018), Montr√©al, Canada.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
