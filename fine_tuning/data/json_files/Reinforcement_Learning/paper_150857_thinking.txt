To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Diffusion Disentangled Representations to Mitigate Shortcuts in Underspecified Visual Tasks" by Luca Scimeca et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of shortcut learning and mention the use of datasets to evaluate their proposed methods. This indicates that datasets are crucial to their experiments, prompting me to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two datasets: **ColorDSprites** and **UTKFace**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the specific features being analyzed.

In the **appendix**, particularly section A.2, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **ColorDSprites**: This dataset consists of symbolic objects generated with variations in five latent variables (shape, scale, orientation, and X-Y position), augmented with a color dimension, resulting in 2,949,120 distinct samples. It is used to examine shortcut biases in a controlled setup.

2. **UTKFace**: This dataset contains 33,488 facial images annotated with attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity. It presents a real-world scenario to study bias, making it suitable for understanding model cue preferences in sensitive contexts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **ColorDSprites**, the citation is:
  > Loic Matthey, Irina Higgins, Demis Hassabis, and Alexander Lerchner. *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/, 2017.

- For **UTKFace**, the citation is:
  > Zhifei Zhang, Yang Song, and Hairong Qi. *Age progression/regression by conditional adversarial autoencoder*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 5810â€“5818, 2017.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
