To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoftTreeMax: Policy Gradient with Tree Search" by Gal Dalal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of SoftTreeMax on Atari environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention conducting experiments on multiple games from the **Atari simulation suite**. This indicates that the Atari games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari simulation suite. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Atari simulation suite**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or benchmarks, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the Atari simulation suite.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Atari simulation suite, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
