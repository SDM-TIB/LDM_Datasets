To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Swin Transformers" by Li Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **49 games in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experimental details sections**. In the **experimental details section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on **49 Atari games** from the Arcade Learning Environment. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more context about the games used. The results tables (Table 3 and Table 4) list the games and their evaluation scores, confirming that the **Arcade Learning Environment** is indeed the dataset they utilized.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, Ioannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, and Martin Riedmiller. *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv:1312.5602 [cs.LG], 2013. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1312.5602.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This dataset consists of 49 Atari games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The games provide a diverse set of challenges for the agents to learn from.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the Arcade Learning Environment dataset.
