To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Convolutional Sparse Coding with Low-Rank Activations, an Application to EEG Analysis" by Pierre Humbert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic datasets and real EEG data recorded during general anesthesia. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any further details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the context of EEG analysis during general anesthesia but does not provide specific dataset names. However, it does mention the importance of EEG signals, which hints that the dataset used for real EEG recordings will be significant.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on a synthetic dataset and a real EEG dataset. The synthetic dataset is described as containing 10 independent signals of size 128x128, generated with specific parameters. The real EEG dataset is noted to consist of 32-channel EEG signals recorded at 250 Hz during general anesthesia, specifically sourced from a previous study.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors provide more details about the real EEG dataset, indicating that it was recorded during general anesthesia and cropped to focus on the recovery of consciousness phase. They also mention preprocessing steps, such as filtering and transforming the signals into a spectrogram representation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. For the synthetic dataset, since it is generated by the authors, there is no external citation needed. However, I will note the parameters used for its generation:
   - Synthetic dataset: 10 independent signals of size 128x128, generated with K = 3 atoms and a specific noise level.

2. For the real EEG dataset, the authors reference:
   > Dubost, C., Humbert, P., Benizri, A., Tourtier, J.-P., Vayatis, N., & Vidal, P.-P. (2019). Selection of the best electroencephalogram channel to predict the depth of anesthesia. *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience*, 13.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: Contains 10 independent signals of size 128x128, generated with specific parameters (K = 3 atoms, noise levels).
- **Real EEG Dataset**: 32-channel EEG signals recorded at 250 Hz during general anesthesia, sourced from Dubost et al. (2019).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
