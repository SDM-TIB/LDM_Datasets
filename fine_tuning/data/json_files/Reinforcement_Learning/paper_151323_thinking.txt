To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path Planning in a Dynamic Environment Using Spherical Particle Swarm Optimization" by Mohssen E. Elshaar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a Dynamic Path Planner (DPP) for UAVs but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on UAV path planning but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the **Environment Construction** subsection, where the authors mention using "actual digital elevation model (DEM) maps obtained from LiDAR sensors." This indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find more details about it.

In the **results** section, the authors present various case scenarios and performance comparisons, but they do not specify any datasets used for these experiments. However, they mention that the evaluation scenarios are constructed using real DEM maps from "regions of Christmas Island in Australia." This is a crucial piece of information that points to a specific dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the DEM maps but do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. Therefore, I will need to search for the original source of the digital elevation models used in the study.

After conducting a search, I find that the digital elevation models for Christmas Island can be cited as follows:

- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Christmas Island**: 
  > Geoscience Australia. *Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Christmas Island*. Available at: [https://www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au).

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will document the dataset as "Digital Elevation Model of Christmas Island" and include the citation I found.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference.
