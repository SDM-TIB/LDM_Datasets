To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Genetic Algorithm Meta-Heuristic for a Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem" by Mojtaba A. Farahani and Alan McKendall, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for what the paper addresses. The introduction often outlines the problem and may reference datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experiments or computational results. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for testing the genetic algorithm or comparisons with other methods. 

In this paper, the authors mention that they solve three instances of the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP) but do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they refer to the use of **MPL/CPLEX software** for solving the problem instances, which implies that they may have used standard datasets or problem instances commonly associated with GQAP research.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited works that may contain datasets. The authors reference two papers that could potentially provide datasets or problem instances relevant to GQAP:

1. McKendall, A., & Li, C. (2017). A tabu search heuristic for a generalized quadratic assignment problem. *Journal of Industrial and Production Engineering*, 34(3), 221-231.
2. Chu, P. C., & Beasley, J. E. (1997). A genetic algorithm for the generalised assignment problem. *Computers & Operations Research*, 24(1), 17-23.

While the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note that the problem instances (small, medium, and large) described in the methodology can be considered as datasets for the purposes of this research. 

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations:

1. **Small GQAP Instance**: A problem instance involving the assignment of six machines to four locations.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but based on the methodology described in the paper.

2. **Medium GQAP Instance**: A problem instance involving the assignment of 20 machines to 15 locations.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but based on the methodology described in the paper.

3. **Large GQAP Instance**: A problem instance involving the assignment of 50 machines to 10 locations.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but based on the methodology described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the relevant citations for the datasets, even if they are not traditional datasets but rather problem instances used in the research.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide explicit datasets, the problem instances used for the GQAP can be treated as datasets for the purpose of this extraction. I will ensure to reference the relevant papers that may contain datasets or methodologies for similar problems.
