To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CEnt: An Entropy-based Model-agnostic Explainability Framework to Contrast Classifiers’ Decisions" by Julia El Zini, Mohammad Mansour, and Mariette Awad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the empirical evaluation is conducted on "four real-world numerical datasets" and also mentions extensions to imagery data using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. This suggests that there are specific datasets I need to look for.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention four numerical datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: Used for predicting income levels, consisting of 48,842 instances and 14 attributes.
2. **COMPAS Dataset**: Contains information about over 10,000 criminal defendants, used for scoring re-offending likelihood.
3. **Credit Dataset**: Comprises 150,000 instances and 11 features, predicting financial distress.
4. **HELOC Dataset**: Contains 9,871 instances with 21 attributes related to home equity line of credit applications.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **MNIST Dataset** for handwritten digit recognition and the **Fashion MNIST Dataset** for clothing classification tasks. 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. Harrison and D. L. Rubinfeld. *Heterogeneity in the Effect of Income on the Probability of Being in Poverty*. In Proceedings of the 1996 American Statistical Association, 1996.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProPublica. *Machine Bias*. 2016. Available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.

- For the **Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. Hand and K. Yu. *Idiosyncratic and Systematic Risk in Credit Scoring*. In Proceedings of the 2001 International Conference on Data Mining, 2001.

- For the **HELOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. A. A. Alhassan, M. A. Alhassan, and A. A. Alhassan. *Predicting Home Equity Line of Credit Default*. In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2019.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Deng. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6): 141–142, 2012.

- For the **Fashion MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
