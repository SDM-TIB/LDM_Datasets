To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithms and the Traveling Salesman Problem: A Historical Review" by Jan Scholz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, related work, materials and methods, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on sections that are more likely to contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and mentions that various methods have been introduced to find optimal or approximate solutions. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will examine the **related work section**. This section reviews previous publications and may reference datasets used in those studies. I will look for any specific datasets that were utilized in the context of genetic algorithms for the TSP.

Moving on to the **materials and methods section**, the author describes the data used for analysis. The paper mentions that the data consists of the content of papers, books, articles, and meta-data of publications related to genetic algorithms and the TSP. The author notes that they acquired data from the **semanticscholar** API, which returned 26,940 unique entries. This indicates a dataset derived from a specific source, but I need to ensure I capture the full citation for this dataset.

In the **evaluation section**, the author discusses the development of genetic algorithms over time and references various publications. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here either.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Semanticscholar Dataset**: This dataset consists of meta-data from a database of over 40 million entries, focusing on publications related to genetic algorithms and the TSP. The dataset was acquired through search queries on the semanticscholar API, resulting in 26,940 unique entries.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the semanticscholar dataset. While the dataset itself may not have a traditional citation, I can reference the semanticscholar website as follows:

- For the **semanticscholar dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Semanticscholar." Semanticscholar.org, 2018. [https://www.semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset entries and ensure that I have the necessary citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to create a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
