To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forgetful Experience Replay in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning from Demonstrations" by Alexey Skrynnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of expert demonstrations and mentions the performance of the proposed algorithm in the MineRL competition, which suggests that datasets related to Minecraft may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of reinforcement learning and the use of expert demonstrations, but I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (MineRL environments)**, the authors describe several environments used for evaluation. They mention specific tasks within the MineRL framework, such as "Navigate," "Treechop," "ObtainIronPickaxe," and "ObtainDiamond." Each of these tasks corresponds to a specific dataset or environment configuration within the MineRL competition.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MineRL competition is referenced, and I will look for the original source or documentation that describes the datasets used in this competition.

The relevant datasets I will extract include:

1. **MineRL Navigate**: This dataset involves an environment where the agent must reach a target location in Minecraft. The dataset includes observations and rewards associated with the navigation task.

2. **MineRL Treechop**: This dataset is focused on the task of chopping wood in Minecraft, where the agent receives rewards for collecting wood.

3. **MineRL ObtainIronPickaxe**: This dataset involves a sequence of tasks to obtain an iron pickaxe, requiring the agent to gather various resources in a specific order.

4. **MineRL ObtainDiamond**: This dataset is similar to the previous one but focuses on obtaining a diamond, which is a more complex task requiring multiple steps.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. The citation for the MineRL competition is:

- For the MineRL competition, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
