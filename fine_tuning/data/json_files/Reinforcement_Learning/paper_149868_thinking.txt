To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Radial Basis Q-Network" by Julien Hautot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in the **Vizdoom environment**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In section 4.1, the authors describe their method and mention using the **Vizdoom scenarios** for evaluation. They specifically outline two scenarios: the **Basic Scenario** and the **Health Gathering Scenario**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather environments or tasks within the Vizdoom framework.

I will then check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or environments used in their experiments. The paper references the **Vizdoom** platform, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments. The relevant citation for Vizdoom is:

- For **Vizdoom**:
  > Kempka, M., et al. "ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning." In Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), pp. 1-8, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2016.7860433

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the Vizdoom scenarios, I will summarize my findings. The primary focus is on the **Vizdoom environment**, which serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Vizdoom environment as it is essential for proper referencing.
