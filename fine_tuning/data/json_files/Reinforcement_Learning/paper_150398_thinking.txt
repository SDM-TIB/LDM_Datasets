To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting and stabilizing chaotic regimes in two macroeconomic models via artificial intelligence technologies and control methods" by Tatyana Alexeeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors typically describe the models and methods used in their experiments. This section may contain specific references to datasets or simulations that were employed in their analysis.

In this paper, the authors discuss two economic models: the overlapping generations (OLG) model and the spatio-temporal (ST) model of pricing patterns. I will look for any datasets or numerical simulations that were used to validate these models.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for comparison or validation of their findings. If they refer to any specific datasets or sources, I will note them down.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include the full citation for each dataset as follows:

1. If they mention a dataset related to the OLG model, I will look for its citation in the references.
2. If they refer to a dataset related to the ST model or any other economic dataset, I will do the same.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through accurate citations.
