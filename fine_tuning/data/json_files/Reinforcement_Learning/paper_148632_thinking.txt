To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games via Entropy-Regularized Policy Approximation" by Yue Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical results applied to a number of stochastic games, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on three specific game environments: **Pursuit-Evasion Game (PEG)**, **Soccer Game**, and **Sequential Rock-Paper-Scissors (sRPS)**. Each of these environments likely corresponds to a dataset or a set of data used for training and evaluation.

I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to where the data can be found. The authors may provide details about the structure of the data, the number of instances, and how it was collected or generated.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will ensure to cite the original sources.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information for each:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This will be the title or common name used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Pursuit-Evasion Game**, I would note:
- **Name**: Pursuit-Evasion Game (PEG)
- **Description**: A game environment where two agents interact on a grid to capture or evade each other.
- **Full citation**: If the dataset is based on a previous work, I would find and include that citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its full citation for future reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
