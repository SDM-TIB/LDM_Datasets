To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAP-AWARE MITIGATION OF GRADIENT STALENESS" by Saar Barkai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on **CIFAR**, **ImageNet**, and **WikiText-103** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, **ImageNet**, and **WikiText-103** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their configurations or characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images, categorized into 1,000 classes.
4. **WikiText-103**: A language modeling dataset containing over 100 million tokens extracted from Wikipedia articles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Geoffrey E. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of representation*. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11(10):428–434, 2007.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael S. Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **WikiText-103**:
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. CoRR, abs/1609.07843, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, context of use, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
