To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-Network for Angry Birds" by Ekaterina Nikonova and Jakub Gemrot, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors collected a dataset of game frames to train their agent, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. In the section titled **V. DEEP Q-NETWORKS FOR AIBIRDS**, the authors describe their training set, which consists of over 115,000 screenshots collected while the agent played the first 21 levels of the Poached Eggs episode of Angry Birds. This is a clear indication of a dataset used for training.

I will also check the **validation set** section, where the authors mention that their validation set consisted of 10 levels from the same episode, specifically selected to ensure no new birds were introduced. This further confirms the existence of datasets.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Training Set**: The training set consists of over 115,000 game frames collected from the first 21 levels of the Poached Eggs episode of Angry Birds. This dataset was used to train the DQN agent.

2. **Validation Set**: The validation set includes 10 levels from the Poached Eggs episode, specifically chosen to avoid introducing new birds that the agent had not been trained on.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the game itself and not published datasets, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on gameplay data from the Angry Birds game.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:

- **Training Set**: Over 115,000 screenshots from the first 21 levels of the Poached Eggs episode of Angry Birds.
- **Validation Set**: 10 levels from the Poached Eggs episode, specifically selected to avoid new birds.

Since these datasets are not formally published, I will note that they are derived from gameplay data rather than traditional datasets with formal citations.

Now, I will prepare to document these findings in a structured format for further processing or review.
