To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring reinforcement learning techniques for discrete and continuous control tasks in the MuJoCo environment" by Vaddadi Sai Rahul and Debajyoti Chakraborty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses leveraging the MuJoCo physics simulator for various tasks, which suggests that the MuJoCo environment itself is a key dataset or resource used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. The introduction outlines the use of MuJoCo for continuous control tasks, indicating that the environments within MuJoCo serve as the datasets for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe various tasks performed in the MuJoCo environment, such as Ant, HalfCheetah, Humanoid, InvertedDoublePendulum, Reacher, Swimmer, and Hopper. Each of these tasks represents a different environment or dataset within the MuJoCo framework.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the MuJoCo environment and the specific tasks mentioned:

1. **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Todorov, E.; Erez, T.; and Tassa, Y. 2012. MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 5026â€“5033. doi:10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

2. **Ant**: The Ant environment is part of the MuJoCo suite and does not have a separate citation, as it is included within the MuJoCo framework.

3. **HalfCheetah**: Similar to Ant, the HalfCheetah environment is also part of the MuJoCo suite.

4. **Humanoid**: The Humanoid environment is included in the MuJoCo framework.

5. **InvertedDoublePendulum**: This task is also part of the MuJoCo environments.

6. **Reacher**: The Reacher task is included in the MuJoCo suite.

7. **Swimmer**: The Swimmer environment is part of the MuJoCo framework.

8. **Hopper**: The Hopper task is also included in the MuJoCo environments.

Since all these tasks are part of the MuJoCo physics engine, they do not have separate citations but are referenced as part of the MuJoCo environment.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the citation for the MuJoCo environment as the primary source for all tasks mentioned. Each task will be noted as a dataset derived from the MuJoCo framework.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citation for the MuJoCo environment is clearly stated for reference.
