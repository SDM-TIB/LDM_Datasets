To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Estimation Bias in Double Q-Learning" by Zhizhou Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors likely describe the datasets used for evaluation in a specific section, possibly labeled as "Experiments" or "Datasets." I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets used in their experiments.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific tasks they are used for. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Atari benchmark tasks," I would look for the original source or publication that introduced this dataset and include that citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
