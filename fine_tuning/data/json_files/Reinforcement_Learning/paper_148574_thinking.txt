To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shopping in the Multiverse: A Counterfactual Approach to In-Session Attribution" by Jacopo Tagliabue and Bingqing Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their methodology on a synthetic dataset and present preliminary findings on an industry dataset. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Dataset (SD)**: This dataset is constructed from sub-sessions of available data from a partnering shop, referred to as Shop X. It contains a total of 1,075,000 sessions, with 375,000 sessions that include search interactions. The dataset is designed to reflect specific patterns observed in their qualitative analysis.

2. **Industry Dataset (ID)**: This dataset consists of anonymized sessions collected from June 2019 to September 2019 from Shop X. It includes 912,884 sessions used for training and 10,000 sampled converting sessions with search for benchmarking.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are synthetic and industry-specific, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper:

- For the **Synthetic Dataset (SD)**, the citation is not applicable as it is generated from Shop X's data.
  
- For the **Industry Dataset (ID)**, similarly, it is based on anonymized data from Shop X, and thus does not have a formal citation.

In this case, I will document the datasets with the information provided in the paper, including the context of their use and the nature of the data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essence of each dataset, ensuring that I include the context and details as described in the paper, even if formal citations are not available.

This methodical approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
