To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Airfoil Shape Optimization using Deep Q-Network" by Siddharth Rout, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning for airfoil optimization, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the optimization techniques and does not provide specific dataset names. 

I will then look into the **methodology** section, particularly where the paper discusses the use of the XFOIL potential flow solver. This section describes how the solver is used to calculate drag and lift values but does not specify a dataset. 

In the **results section**, the author presents findings based on the optimization of the NACA 0012 airfoil, but again, there are no datasets mentioned. 

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or tools used in the research. The references include foundational texts on reinforcement learning and the XFOIL software, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no distinct datasets provided or referenced in the research. The work primarily focuses on the application of reinforcement learning techniques and the use of the XFOIL solver for airfoil optimization rather than on specific datasets.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none mentioned in the paper. 

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses methodologies and tools, it does not include specific datasets for airfoil shape optimization.
