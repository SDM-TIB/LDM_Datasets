To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variations of Genetic Algorithms" by Alison Jenkins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various types of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and their performance, but again, there is no mention of specific datasets. I will proceed to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the algorithms used.

As I read through the **methodology**, I will look for any references to datasets used for testing the GAs. The authors mention conducting experiments with different crossover methods and evaluating their performance based on function evaluations, but they do not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The results section discusses the performance of the algorithms but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **figures** referenced in the results section. Figure 1 is labeled as "GA Data Set," which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but the paper does not provide details about it.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to see if any of the cited works might provide datasets related to the experiments. However, the references listed are primarily books and presentations that do not seem to directly relate to specific datasets.

Given that the paper lacks explicit dataset information, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.** The authors focused on comparing different Genetic Algorithms and their performance metrics without providing details on the datasets used for their experiments.

2. **Figure 1 indicates the presence of a dataset, but no further details are provided.** This suggests that the dataset may be proprietary or not publicly available.

3. **The references do not cite any datasets directly.** They are more focused on theoretical aspects of Genetic Algorithms and related topics.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses various Genetic Algorithms and their performance, it does not provide explicit dataset names or citations. Therefore, I cannot create structured entries for datasets as there are none identified in the text. If I were to summarize the findings, I would state that the paper lacks dataset information, which is crucial for replicating the experiments or understanding the data context.
