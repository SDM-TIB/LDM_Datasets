To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-line approximate dynamic programming for the vehicle routing problem with a highly variable customer basis and stochastic demands" by M. Dastpak, F. Errico, and O. Jabali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors often describe the datasets they used in detail in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for:

1. **Customer Demand Data**: The paper discusses stochastic demands and customer requests. I will check if the authors provide a dataset or a description of how they generated the customer demand data.

2. **Instance Generation**: The authors mention generating instances for the VRP-VCSD. I will look for any details on how these instances were created, including any datasets used for customer locations, expected demands, and vehicle capacities.

3. **Comparative Datasets**: The paper compares the proposed method with existing benchmarks. I will check if the authors reference any datasets used in those benchmark studies.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This may involve looking at the **References section** to find the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the Solomon instances for vehicle routing problems, I will note the citation as follows:

- Solomon, M. M. (1987). Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints. *Operations Research*, 35(2), 254-265.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary details accurately.
