To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Interplay of Prioritized Replay and Generalization" by Parham Mohammad Panahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors discuss various experiments involving reinforcement learning but do not explicitly mention any datasets in the main body of the text. However, they reference classic control problems like **MountainCar, Acrobot, Cartpole, and Cliffworld**. I will treat these as datasets for the purpose of this extraction, as they are standard environments used in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The citations for these classic control problems are generally well-known and can be sourced from foundational papers in reinforcement learning:

1. **MountainCar**: 
   > Moore, A. W. (1990). Efficient memory-based learning for robot control. Technical report, University of Cambridge.

2. **Acrobot**: 
   > Sutton, R. S. (1995). Generalization in reinforcement learning: Successful examples using sparse coarse coding. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 8. MIT Press.

3. **Cartpole**: 
   > Barto, A. G., Sutton, R. S., & Anderson, C. W. (1983). Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 13(5), 834-846.

4. **Cliffworld**: 
   > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
