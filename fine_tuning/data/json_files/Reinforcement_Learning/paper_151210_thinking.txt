To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-policy Distributional Q(Î»): Distributional RL without Importance Sampling" by Yunhao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) closely, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on **tabular MDP settings** and **deep RL experiments** using the **Atari game suite**. I will note that the Atari game suite is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning research, and I will ensure to capture its full citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **Atari game suite**, I will use the following citation:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

If there are any other datasets mentioned in the experiments or results sections, I will document them similarly, ensuring to provide their full citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation.
