To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Policy Optimization Actual Combat: Manipulating Output Tokenizer Length" by Miao Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and descriptions in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they have accumulated approximately **17 million instances of SFT data** and refined it into a dataset referred to as the **'cocktail' dataset**. This dataset is specifically designed for their experiments and is crucial for understanding their methodology.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology or results subsections**. The authors describe using a subset of the cocktail dataset for their experiments, which includes specific configurations for training and testing. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a traditional dataset citation for the cocktail dataset, as it appears to be a novel dataset created by the authors. However, I will ensure to note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the study.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Cocktail Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 3 million instances that have been reprocessed and refined for the experiments. Each question in this dataset is paired with an answer that meets or exceeds the quality standard set by GPT-4.

Since the cocktail dataset is not a publicly available dataset with a formal citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors for their specific research purposes.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately, including the proprietary nature of the cocktail dataset.
