To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Table2Charts: Recommending Charts by Learning Shared Table Representations" by Mengyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large spreadsheet corpus with 165k tables and 266k charts, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Chart Corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two main datasets:

1. **Excel Corpus**: This dataset consists of 266,252 charts created from 165,214 unique tables extracted from Excel spreadsheet files. The authors detail the preparation steps taken to ensure the quality of this dataset, including cell reference cleansing and source table restoration.

2. **Plotly Corpus**: This dataset includes 36,888 tables with 67,617 charts sourced from the public Plotly community feed. The authors also describe the data processing steps taken to prepare this dataset for evaluation.

In **section 4.1.1**, the authors provide specific statistics about the Excel Corpus, detailing the number of charts by type (e.g., line, bar, scatter, etc.), which further emphasizes the dataset's significance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are not traditional publications but rather collections of data, they may not have formal citations like journal articles. Instead, I will note the authors' descriptions and the context in which these datasets were used.

For the **Excel Corpus**, the citation is:
> Zhou, M., Li, Q., He, X., Li, Y., Liu, Y., Ji, W., Han, S., Chen, Y., Jiang, D., & Zhang, D. (2021). Table2Charts: Recommending Charts by Learning Shared Table Representations. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '21), August 14â€“18, 2021, Virtual Event, Singapore. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467279

For the **Plotly Corpus**, the citation is:
> Plotly Community Feed. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://plotly.com/community/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the context provided in the paper. This will allow for accurate referencing in future research or applications.
