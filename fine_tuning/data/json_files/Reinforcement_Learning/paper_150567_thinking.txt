To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RSRM: Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine" by Yilong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in understanding their relevance.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention the **Free-falling Balls Dataset** in section 4.2. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of observations and the context in which it was used. The dataset consists of experimental data of balls dropped from a bridge, with 20-30 observations of ball throw heights within the first 2 seconds.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any benchmark datasets used for comparison. In this case, the authors compare their model's performance against several baseline methods, which may involve datasets like the **Nguyen benchmark**, **LiverMore benchmark**, and **R benchmark**.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **Free-falling Balls Dataset**, the citation is:
> Brian M de Silva, David M Higdon, Steven L Brunton, and J Nathan Kutz. *Discovery of physics from data: Universal laws and discrepancies*. Frontiers in artificial intelligence, 3:25, 2020.

For the **Nguyen benchmark**, the citation is:

For the **LiverMore benchmark**, the citation is:

For the **R benchmark**, the citation is:
> James McDermott, David R White, Sean Luke, Luca Manzoni, Mauro Castelli, Leonardo Vanneschi, Wojciech Jaskowski, Krzysztof Krawiec, Robin Harper, Kenneth De Jong, et al. *Genetic programming needs better benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the 14th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation, pages 791–798, 2012.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
