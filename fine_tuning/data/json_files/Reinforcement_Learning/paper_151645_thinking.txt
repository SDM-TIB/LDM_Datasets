To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Global Anomalies on Distributed IoT Edges with Device-to-Device Communication" by Riku Nishihata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "standard benchmark-based evaluation," which suggests that specific datasets are utilized for testing the proposed method. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of anomaly detection in IoT applications. They mention the use of "MNIST families" for benchmark evaluation, which indicates that the MNIST dataset is involved. I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in this section.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for testing. They specifically mention four types of test datasets: 

1. **Noisy-MNIST**: A modified version of the MNIST dataset with added noise.
2. **Occluded-MNIST**: Another variant of the MNIST dataset where parts of the images are occluded.
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of fashion items, serving as a more challenging alternative to MNIST.
4. **Kuzushiji-MNIST**: A dataset containing handwritten Japanese characters, also used for testing.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by cross-referencing them with the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- For **Kuzushiji-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat, M. Bober-Irizar, A. Kitamoto, A. Lamb, K. Yamamoto, and D. Ha. *Deep Learning for Classical Japanese Literature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

- For **Noisy-MNIST** and **Occluded-MNIST**, since they are modifications of the original MNIST dataset, I will reference the original MNIST citation, but I will note that they are derived datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
