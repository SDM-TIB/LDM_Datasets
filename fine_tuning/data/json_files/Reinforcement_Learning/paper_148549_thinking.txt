To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Prioritized State Recycled Experience Replay" by Fanchen Bu and Dong Eui Chang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on many Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses experience replay and its significance in reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets yet. 

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors present results from various Atari games, which indicates that the datasets used are likely the environments from the OpenAI Gym platform.

I will also check the **implementation details** and **acknowledgments** sections for any references to specific datasets or platforms used in their experiments. The authors mention that they completed their implementation based on the OpenAI Gym platform, which is crucial information.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper primarily discusses the use of Atari games, I will look for the relevant citations related to the OpenAI Gym and any specific Atari game datasets.

The relevant citations I will extract are:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. 

2. **Atari Games**: The specific Atari games mentioned in the experiments (e.g., AirRaid, Alien, etc.) are part of the OpenAI Gym environments, so they do not have separate citations but are included in the OpenAI Gym reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
