To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An FPGA-Based On-Device Reinforcement Learning Approach Using Online Sequential Learning" by Hirohisa Watanabe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions using **OpenAI Gym** for evaluation, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Evaluations)**, where the authors describe the reinforcement learning task they are evaluating. They specifically mention using the **CartPole-v0** task from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the dataset or environment used for their experiments is indeed the CartPole-v0 task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym and the CartPole-v0 task. The relevant citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, and John Schulman. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the CartPole-v0 task is part of the OpenAI Gym, it does not have a separate citation but is included within the OpenAI Gym framework.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CartPole-v0 Task**: This is a reinforcement learning environment used for evaluation in the paper. It is part of the OpenAI Gym framework.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the necessary citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
