To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Analysis of LLMs using Meaningful Counterfactuals" by Furui Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their algorithm using samples from various datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Generating Meaningful Counterfactuals)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluated their algorithm using **1,000 samples from medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets**. This is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved.

I will then look for specific names of the datasets in **section 4.2 (Experiments)**, where the authors list five datasets:

1. **MedQA**: A dataset used for medical question answering.
2. **BillSum**: A dataset for automatic summarization of US legislation.
3. **FiQA**: A dataset for financial question answering.
4. **TinyTextbooks**: A dataset for educational content.
5. **MultiNews**: A dataset for multi-document summarization.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MedQA**, the citation is:
  > A. Madaan, I. Padhi, N. Panwar, and D. Saha. *Generate Your Counterfactuals: Towards Controlled Counterfactual Generation for Text*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 35, pp. 13516–13524, 2021.

- For **BillSum**, the citation is:
  > A. Kornilova and V. Eidelman. *BillSum: A Corpus for Automatic Summarization of US Legislation*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pp. 48–56, 2019.

- For **FiQA**, the citation is:
  > M. Maia, S. Handschuh, A. Freitas, B. Davis, R. McDermott, M. Zarrouk, and A. Balahur. *WWW’18 Open Challenge: Financial Opinion Mining and Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Web Conference, pp. 1941–1942, 2018.

- For **TinyTextbooks**, the citation is:
  > Nam Pham. *Tiny-Textbooks (revision 14de7ba)*, 2023. doi: 10.57967/hf/1126.

- For **MultiNews**, the citation is:
  > A. R. Fabbri, I. Li, T. She, S. Li, and D. R. Radev. *Multi-News: A Large-Scale Multi-Document Summarization Dataset and Abstractive Hierarchical Model*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1–15, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
