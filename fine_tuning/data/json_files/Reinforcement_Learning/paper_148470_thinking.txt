To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Aviral Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "previously collected datasets in reinforcement learning," which indicates that datasets are indeed a focus of the research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the experiments. For instance, if the authors compare their method against benchmarks, they may list the datasets used for those comparisons.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "D4RL" benchmark datasets, I will look for the original paper that introduced these datasets to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a clear format, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
