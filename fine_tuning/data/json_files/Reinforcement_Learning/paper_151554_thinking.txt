To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CarLLaVA: Vision language models for camera-only closed-loop driving" by Katrin Renz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that CarLLaVA is developed for the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2.0, which suggests that datasets related to this challenge may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They mention utilizing the "privileged rule-based expert PDM-light" to collect a dataset and detail how they divided the official CARLA routes of Town 12 and Town 13 into shorter segments. This indicates that the CARLA dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their benchmarks and results, which may provide additional context about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention collecting 2.9 million samples at 5 fps, which further emphasizes the scale of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the CARLA leaderboard and other related works, which may provide insights into the original sources of the datasets.

1. **CARLA Dataset**: The authors utilize the CARLA simulator for their experiments. The citation for the CARLA dataset is:
   > Carla autonomous driving leaderboard. https://leaderboard.carla.org/, 2020.

2. **PDM-light**: The authors mention using a rule-based planner called PDM-light for data collection. The citation for this technical report is:
   > Jens Beißwenger. PDM-lite: A rule-based planner for CARLA leaderboard 2.0. Technical report, University of Tübingen, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
