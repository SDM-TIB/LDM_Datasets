To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Multi-Robot Object Manipulation" by Guohui Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed approaches in a cooperative object manipulation setting with simulated robot arms, which suggests that there may be datasets related to robotic simulations or environments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any specific experiments or simulations that might reference datasets. The paper mentions using the **Gazebo simulator** for the experiments, which indicates that the authors likely used simulated environments rather than traditional datasets. I will look for any references to specific simulation scenarios or configurations that could be considered datasets.

In the **acknowledgments** and **references** sections, I will check for any citations that might refer to datasets or simulation environments used in their experiments. The references may include foundational works or datasets that are relevant to the methods discussed.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information regarding any datasets or simulation environments mentioned, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets but refers to simulation environments, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations formatted properly for any datasets or simulation environments identified, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets or simulation environments.
2. Examine the methodology and results sections for specific experiments and their configurations.
3. Check the acknowledgments and references for any relevant citations.
4. Compile the findings and ensure proper citation formatting for any identified datasets or simulation environments.
