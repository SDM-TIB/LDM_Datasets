To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constraining the Attack Space of Machine Learning Models with Distribution Clamping Preprocessing" by Ryan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1.1 (Dataset and Model)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using **CARLA** generated data, specifically the subset available in the Armory framework. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of training and validation images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The authors reference the CARLA simulator in their work, and I need to ensure I capture the correct citation for it.

The citation for the CARLA dataset is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented entry for the CARLA dataset, ready for further use or analysis.
