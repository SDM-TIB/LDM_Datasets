To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aquatic Navigation: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Davide Corsi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a benchmarking environment for aquatic navigation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Evaluation."

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the use of a simulator for aquatic navigation and mention that they validate their agent in a cave environment created using real-world data. This indicates that there may be datasets related to the cave navigation scenario.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets or benchmarks, I will need to extract the full citation for each.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Porth yr Ogof Cave Dataset**: This dataset is created using real-world data from the Porth yr Ogof cave in South Wales. It is used to validate the performance of the deep reinforcement learning agent in a realistic environment.

2. **Aquatic Navigation Simulator**: The authors developed a simulator for aquatic navigation that allows for the generation of various training and testing environments. While this is not a traditional dataset, it provides a structured environment for data collection and experimentation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
