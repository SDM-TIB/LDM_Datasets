To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Rainbow: Promoting more Insightful and Inclusive Deep Reinforcement Learning Research" by Johan S. Obando-Ceron and Pablo Samuel Castro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods on standard environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference standard environments such as **Atari 2600 games** and **classic control tasks**. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets used for evaluation, but I need to confirm their details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Revisiting Rainbow)**, where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using **small-scale environments** like **CartPole, Acrobot, LunarLander, and MountainCar**, which are part of the OpenAI Gym library. This section confirms that these environments are indeed datasets used in their experiments.

Additionally, in the **appendices**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of these environments, which will help me gather more information about each dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **OpenAI Gym** (for CartPole, Acrobot, LunarLander, and MountainCar):
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. URL: https://github.com/openai/gym.

2. **MinAtar** (for Asterix, Breakout, Freeway, Seaquest, and SpaceInvaders):
   > Kenny Young and Tian Tian. *Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
