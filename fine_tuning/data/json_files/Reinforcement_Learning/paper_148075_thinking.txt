To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-stage Training for Chinese Dialect Recognition" by Zongze Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a two-stage language identification (LID) system used for the Xunfei (iFlyTek) Chinese Dialect Recognition Challenge, which indicates that there is a dataset involved in this challenge. The introduction elaborates on the dialect database containing 10 dialects in China, which suggests that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they describe a database covering 10 widespread Chinese dialects, including Ningxia, Hefei, Sichuan, Shanxi, Changsha, Hebei, Nanchang, Shanghai, Kekka, and Fujian. Each dialect has 6 hours of audio data, with 6000 audio files for training and 500 for testing.

I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Chinese Dialect Database**: This dataset includes audio recordings from 10 different Chinese dialects, with a total of 6 hours of audio data per dialect. The training set consists of 6000 audio files per dialect, while the test set contains 500 audio files per dialect, categorized by duration.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Chinese Dialect Database, as it appears to be a proprietary dataset used in the iFlyTek challenge. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is associated with the iFlyTek Chinese Dialect Recognition Challenge.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the relevant citation or acknowledgment of the source.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the Chinese Dialect Database used in the iFlyTek challenge, and I will ensure to document it properly in the final output.
