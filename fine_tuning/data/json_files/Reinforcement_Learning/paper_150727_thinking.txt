To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Full-disk Deep Learning Model for Solar Flare Prediction using Attribution Methods" by Chetraj Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of solar flare prediction and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own. I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their data collection process. In this section, they mention using **compressed images of full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetograms obtained from the HMI/SDO**. This indicates that the dataset consists of solar magnetogram images, which are crucial for their model.

The authors specify that they collected **63,649 magnetogram images** from December 2010 to December 2018, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They also mention the labeling process based on the maximum peak X-ray flux, categorizing the data into "Flare" and "No Flare" classes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide further details on how they utilized the dataset for training and validation, confirming its relevance to their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **Helioviewer API** as the source for the magnetogram images. The citation for this source is:

- **Helioviewer API**: 
  > HelioviewerAPIV2: https://api.helioviewer.org/docs/v2/

Additionally, the authors mention using data from the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)** for classifying solar flares, which is relevant to the dataset's context. However, NOAA is not a dataset itself but rather an organization that provides data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Helioviewer API as the primary source of the dataset used in the study. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly cited.
