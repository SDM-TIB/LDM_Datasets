To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Grammar Augmentation for Robust Voice Command Recognition" by Yang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of designing robust voice UI systems and mention the use of a command-specific dataset for evaluating recognition accuracy. However, they do not specify the dataset's name or details at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as it is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used. The authors state that they conducted experiments with a dataset containing five commands: "play music," "pause music," "stop music," "next song," and "previous song." This indicates that there is a command-specific dataset used for training and evaluation.

I will also look for any references to the dataset's source or citation in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this specific dataset, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for the study.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is a custom command-specific dataset created for the experiments, and I will document it accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details of the dataset and its context within the research.

1. **Command-Specific Dataset**: This dataset contains utterances for five commands: "play music," "pause music," "stop music," "next song," and "previous song." It includes variations in gender, pitch, volume, noise types, and accents, and is split into training, validation, and testing datasets.

Since there are no formal citations provided for this dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its relevance to the study.
