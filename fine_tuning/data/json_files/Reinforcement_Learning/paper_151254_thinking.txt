To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interference Mitigation in LEO Constellations with Limited Radio Environment Information" by Fernando Moya Caceres et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their simulations or analyses. In this paper, the authors discuss various scenarios involving Radio Environment Maps (REM) and interference mitigation strategies, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets.

I will also check the **system model and numerical results sections** for any references to datasets that may have been used to validate their findings. The authors may describe the parameters or conditions of their simulations, which could imply the use of specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the authors refer to any datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and the full citations as follows:

1. **Radio Environment Map (REM)**: If the authors describe a specific REM dataset used in their simulations, I will summarize its characteristics and provide the citation.

2. **Simulation Parameters**: If the authors mention specific datasets or parameters used in their simulations (e.g., user locations, interference sources), I will document these as well.

3. **Cognitive Satellite Radios Research Project**: If this project is referenced as a source of data or methodology, I will include it in the dataset entries.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
