To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brax - A Differentiable Physics Engine for Large Scale Rigid Body Simulation" by C. Daniel Freeman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Brax library and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for evaluation or training. In this paper, the authors discuss various environments and tasks, particularly in sections 4 and 5, which detail the environments included in the initial release of Brax.

In **section 4.2 (Gym-like environments)**, the authors list several environments that are included with Brax, which can be considered datasets for reinforcement learning tasks. The environments mentioned are:

1. **Halfcheetah**: A continuous control environment based on the MuJoCo physics engine.
2. **Ant**: Another continuous control environment, also based on MuJoCo.
3. **Humanoid**: A more complex continuous control environment for humanoid robots.
4. **Grasp**: A dexterous manipulation environment where a robotic hand must pick and place objects.
5. **Fetch**: A goal-directed locomotion environment for a quadruped robot.

Each of these environments serves as a dataset for training reinforcement learning algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the original sources of these environments. The environments are based on the following references:

- For **MuJoCo** environments (Halfcheetah, Ant, Humanoid):
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033. IEEE, 2012.

- For **Grasp** and **Fetch** environments, they are inspired by existing literature but do not have specific citations in this paper. However, they are commonly used in the reinforcement learning community and can be referenced as:
  > Various authors. *OpenAI Gym: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms*. URL: https://gym.openai.com/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation for proper attribution.
