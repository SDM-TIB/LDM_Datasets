To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Macro Action Selection with Deep Reinforcement Learning in StarCraft" by Sijia Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a bot for StarCraft and mentions training against bots from the AIIDE 2017 StarCraft AI competition, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these competitions.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to identify any datasets that may have been used in previous research or that the authors reference. This section often provides context and may mention datasets that are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention training against all bots from the AIIDE 2017 StarCraft AI competition set, which indicates that this competition dataset is significant for their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets from previous works, I will need to ensure I capture the correct citations.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **AIIDE 2017 StarCraft AI Competition Bots Set**: This dataset includes various bots that participated in the AIIDE 2017 competition, which the authors used to evaluate their bot's performance. The competition dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

2. **AIIDE 2018 StarCraft AI Competition Bots Set**: The authors also mention using a pre-trained version of their bot to compete in the AIIDE 2018 competition, indicating that this dataset is relevant for their evaluation metrics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **AIIDE 2017 StarCraft AI Competition**, the citation is:
  > AIIDE. 2017. Official AIIDE 2017 StarCraft Competition Results. http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/2017/.

- For the **AIIDE 2018 StarCraft AI Competition**, the citation is:
  > AIIDE. 2018. Official AIIDE 2018 StarCraft Competition Results. http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/2018/.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
