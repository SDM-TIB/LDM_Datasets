To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree Search-Based Policy Optimization Under Stochastic Execution Delay" by David Valensi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **Atari suite**. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or benchmarks related to this suite. If they refer to any specific games or configurations within the Atari suite, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari 100k benchmark**, I will look for the original paper that introduced this benchmark to provide a complete citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
