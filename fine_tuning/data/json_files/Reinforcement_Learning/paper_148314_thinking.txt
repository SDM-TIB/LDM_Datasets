To extract datasets from the research paper titled "G-Learner and GIRL: Goal Based Wealth Management with Reinforcement Learning" by Matthew F. Dixon and Igor Halperin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a reinforcement learning approach to wealth management but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is not explicitly labeled in the provided text but can be inferred from the structure) to identify any datasets used for testing the proposed algorithms. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their contents.

As I read through the paper, I will pay particular attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the use of datasets. If the authors refer to any datasets in the context of their experiments or results, I will note those down.

In the provided text, there are mentions of historical data and trajectories used for the G-learning and GIRL algorithms, but no specific datasets are named. I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous work or methodologies that the authors have built upon.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution. For example, if a dataset is referenced, I will look for the original paper or source that describes the dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments section for specific datasets used.
3. Checking figures, tables, and references for additional dataset information.
4. Documenting each dataset with its full citation for proper attribution.
