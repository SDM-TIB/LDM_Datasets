To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Evaluation for Explainable AI" by Yingqiang Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and datasets used in the experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of their proposed methodology on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments. However, I need to locate the specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Movie Reviews Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,443 movie review excerpts with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative). The authors reference the original work by Pang et al. (2002) for this dataset.

2. **Adults Dataset**: This dataset contains records of 15,682 individuals and is used to predict whether their annual income exceeds $50,000. The authors cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua and Graff, 2017) as the source for this dataset.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Movie Reviews Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. *Thumbs up? sentiment classification using machine learning techniques*. In Proceedings of the ACL-02 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing - Volume 10, EMNLP ’02, pages 79–86, 2002. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Adults Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
