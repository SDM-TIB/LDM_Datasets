To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SI-SD: Sleep Interpreter through awake-guided cross-subject Semantic Decoding" by Hui Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a comprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 134 subjects, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they collected. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Image-Evoked Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 270,000 0.8-second EEG samples paired with semantic labels from 15 pre-determined concepts, recorded during the image stimulus presentation.

2. **Audio-Evoked Dataset**: Similar to the image-evoked dataset, this dataset also contains around 270,000 0.8-second EEG samples, each paired with corresponding semantic labels from audio stimuli.

3. **TMR-Related Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 135,000 2-second EEG samples from NREM 2/3 sleep and about 35,000 2-second samples from REM sleep, segmented based on the timing of audio stimuli presented during sleep.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the datasets are original to this study and do not have external citations, I will note that the dataset is described as follows:

- **Dataset Title**: EEG dataset for sleep semantic decoding
- **Authors**: Hui Zheng et al.
- **Details**: Collected from 134 healthy subjects, containing both awake and sleep EEG recordings, with ground truth regarding memory activation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
