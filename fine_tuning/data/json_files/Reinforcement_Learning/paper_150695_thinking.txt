To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replay to Remember: Continual Layer-Specific Fine-tuning for German Speech Recognition" by Theresa Pekarek Rosin and Stefan Wermter, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of German Senior Voice Commands (SVC-de), which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They mention that SVC-de consists of short speech commands recorded by German speakers aged 50 to 99, totaling 3 hours and 9 minutes of audio data. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the number of speakers and the nature of the recordings.

Additionally, I will check **section 3.1 (Data)** for any other datasets referenced. Here, the authors also mention **Common Voice DE (CV-de)**, which is described as one of the largest German speech datasets, containing 1,136 validated hours of audio from 16,944 different speakers. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and comparisons.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **German Senior Voice Commands (SVC-de)**, since it is a novel dataset created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in detail within the paper.

2. For **Common Voice DE (CV-de)**, the citation is:
   > Ardila, R., Branson, M., Davis, K., Kohler, M., Meyer, J., Henretty, M., Morais, R., Saunders, L., Tyers, F., Weber, G. (2020). Common Voice: A Massively-Multilingual Speech Corpus. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference. European Language Resources Association, Marseille, France.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations, ensuring to include the necessary details for each dataset as outlined in the task requirements. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
