To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning based Recommender Systems: A Survey" by M. Mehdi Afsar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the introduction discusses various applications of recommender systems, but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss various reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications, but I need to identify specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **tables and figures**, I will pay special attention to any that summarize or list datasets. For instance, Table 2 and Table 3 provide an overview of RL-based and DRL-based methods, respectively, and include columns for datasets used in each method. This is a crucial step as it may reveal multiple datasets that are referenced throughout the paper.

In Table 2, I find the following datasets mentioned:
1. **CMU**: Used in the context of a web recommendation system.
2. **Mitos**: Mentioned but without further details.
3. **DePaul**: Also referenced in relation to a specific method.
4. **Amazon**: Commonly used in recommender systems.
5. **Million Song Dataset**: A well-known dataset for music recommendations.
6. **MovieLens**: Frequently used in recommendation research.

In Table 3, I see additional datasets:
1. **MIMIC**: Used in healthcare applications.
2. **ML1M**: A variant of the MovieLens dataset.
3. **Yelp**: Often used for restaurant recommendations.
4. **Last.fm**: Another music recommendation dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For example, the citation for the **MovieLens dataset** is:
> GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

The citation for the **Million Song Dataset** is:
> Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P. W., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). *The Million Song Dataset*. In ISMIR 2011.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete, as this is critical for the integrity of the research and for facilitating further studies in the field of recommender systems.
