To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithmic Collusion in Dynamic Pricing with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Shidi Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the examination of collusion in pricing strategies using reinforcement learning algorithms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** section, particularly the **experimental design** subsection, as this is where datasets are likely to be mentioned. I will look for any references to data sources or datasets used in the experiments. 

In the **experimental design** section, the authors describe their numerical studies and mention using various algorithms in a simulated market environment. However, they do not specify any real-world datasets or publicly available datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they refer to the parameters and models they set up for their simulations.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that might have been used indirectly. I will look for papers that discuss data collection or datasets related to algorithmic pricing or reinforcement learning.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several papers that may contain relevant datasets:

1. **Calvano et al. (2020)** discusses algorithmic pricing and collusion, which may reference datasets used in their experiments. The citation is:
   > Calvano, E., Calzolari, G., Denicolo, V., & Pastorello, S. (2020). *Artificial intelligence, algorithmic pricing, and collusion*. American Economic Review, 110, 3267–3297.

2. **Klein (2021)** analyzes Q-learning in pricing, which might also reference datasets. The citation is:
   > Klein, T. (2021). *Autonomous algorithmic collusion: Q-learning under sequential pricing*. The RAND Journal of Economics, 52, 538–558.

3. **Assad et al. (2020)** provides empirical evidence from the retail gasoline market, which could include datasets relevant to pricing algorithms. The citation is:
   > Assad, S., Clark, R., Ershov, D., & Xu, L. (2020). *Algorithmic pricing and competition: Empirical evidence from the German retail gasoline market*.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings and note that the datasets are not directly provided in the paper but can be inferred from the references cited.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources as discussed in the paper.
