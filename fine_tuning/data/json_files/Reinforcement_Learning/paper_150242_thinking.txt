To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the Side-Chain Packing Arrangement of Proteins from Reinforcement Learned Stochastic Decision Making" by Chandrajit Bajaj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses related work and datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of the **Protein Data Bank (PDB)** as a source of protein atomistic data. This is a crucial dataset for protein structure prediction and is likely to be referenced in the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Protein Data Bank. The citation for the PDB is typically as follows:
> Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., & Shindyalov, I. N. (2000). The Protein Data Bank. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 28(1), 235-242. doi:10.1093/nar/28.1.235

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for training reinforcement learning models or any specific benchmarks referenced in the context of their methodology.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to document each dataset clearly, including its name, description, and full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and reproducibility in research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
