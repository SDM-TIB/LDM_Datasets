To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EduQate: Generating Adaptive Curricula through RMABs in Education Settings" by Sidney Tio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is created based on specific constraints and simulates student interactions with educational content. However, it does not have a formal citation since it is generated by the authors.

2. **Junyi Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing nearly 26 million student-exercise interactions across 250,000 students in its mathematics curriculum. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Haw-Shiuan Chang, Hwai-Jung Hsu, and Kuan-Ta Chen. *Modeling exercise relationships in e-learning: A unified approach*. In EDM, pages 532â€“535, 2015.

3. **OLI Statics Dataset**: This dataset comprises student interactions with an online Engineering Statics course. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Norman Bier. *OLI Engineering Statics - Fall 2011 (114 students)*, 2011. URL: https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/DatasetInfo?datasetId=590.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and citations accurately. The synthetic dataset does not require a citation, but the Junyi and OLI datasets do.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
