To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PROGrasp: Pragmatic Human-Robot Communication for Object Grasping" by Gi-Cheon Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **Intention-oriented Multi-modal Dialogue (IM-Dial)**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely, where the authors describe the IM-Dial dataset in detail. They mention that it contains **800 images and 500 human-to-human dialogue data** regarding **86 categories of everyday objects**. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their proposed method using the IM-Dial dataset. They describe how the dataset is divided into different splits for training, validation, and testing, which further emphasizes its importance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the IM-Dial dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper and does not have an external citation, I will note that the dataset is created by the authors themselves and provide the necessary details as follows:

- **Intention-oriented Multi-modal Dialogue (IM-Dial)**: This dataset is introduced in the paper and consists of 800 images and 500 dialogue pairs covering 86 categories of everyday objects. The dataset is used to study pragmatic reasoning behavior in human-robot interaction.

Since the IM-Dial dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset's name, description, and the authors' details as the citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
