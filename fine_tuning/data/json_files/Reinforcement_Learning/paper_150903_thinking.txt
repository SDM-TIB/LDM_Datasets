To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network-thinking to optimize surveillance and control of crop parasites. A review" by Andrea Radici et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss specific studies or models** related to crop parasites. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on network theory in crop protection, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the text.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Crop-parasite interactions in a network framework)**, which appears to contain detailed examples of studies that may reference datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the studies cited within this section.

In **subsection 4.1 (Vector-transmitted parasites)**, I find references to studies by Strona et al. (2017) and de la Fuente et al. (2018). I will note the details of these studies to see if they include datasets:

1. **Strona et al. (2017)**: This study examines the spread of Xylella fastidiosa in olive orchards. I will check if the authors provide a dataset or if the study is based on existing data.

2. **de la Fuente et al. (2018)**: This study models the spread of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Again, I will look for any dataset mentioned.

In **subsection 4.2 (Wind-dispersed)**, I will review the work of Sutrave et al. (2012) and Meyer et al. (2017). I will extract any datasets they mention:

1. **Sutrave et al. (2012)**: This study focuses on soybean fields and the airborne pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. I will look for dataset details.

2. **Meyer et al. (2017)**: This study involves the airborne dispersal of P. graminis. I will check for dataset references.

In **subsection 4.3 (Human-mediated)**, I will analyze the studies by Andersen et al. (2019) and Hernandez Nopsa et al. (2015) for any datasets they might have used.

In **subsection 4.4 (Multi-mechanism)**, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of summarizing multiple mechanisms of parasitic spread.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the studies. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
