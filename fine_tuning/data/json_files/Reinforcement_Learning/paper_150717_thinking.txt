To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning" by Alexander Grushin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses evaluating the approach on learned policies from APE-X and A3C within an Atari environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the need for safety margins in autonomous systems but does not explicitly name any datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors mention running experiments with the Atari game BeamRider. This indicates that the Atari environment is being used, but I need to confirm if there are specific datasets associated with this game or if they are using a standard dataset from the Atari suite.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach and the proxy criticality metrics but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they reference the use of policies from APE-X and A3C, which are algorithms rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. The references include various papers related to adversarial attacks and critical states in reinforcement learning, but they do not specify datasets either.

Given that the paper primarily discusses methodologies and results without naming specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no distinct datasets cited in this paper. However, the Atari environment itself is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning research, and I can provide a general citation for the Atari Learning Environment.

The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting that the primary dataset referenced is the Atari Learning Environment, which is used for the experiments in the paper.
