To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlapAI Bird: Training an Agent to Play Flappy Bird Using Reinforcement Learning Techniques" by Tai Vu and Leon Tran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of reinforcement learning to the game Flappy Bird, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **infrastructure and implementation sections** to see if there are any references to datasets used for training or testing the agents. In this case, the paper primarily discusses the implementation of algorithms and does not mention any external datasets. Instead, it utilizes the Flappy Bird game environment provided by OpenAI Gym, which serves as the training environment for the agents.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets beyond the game environment itself, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or environments used. The references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and the OpenAI Gym environment, but they do not provide citations for any datasets.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The paper utilizes the OpenAI Gym environment for training the reinforcement learning agents. While this is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is a crucial component of the experimental setup.

The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude the extraction process here. The primary focus of the paper is on the algorithms and their performance rather than on external datasets.
