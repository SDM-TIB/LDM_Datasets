To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Perception for Safe Control of Autonomous Vehicles under LiDAR Spoofing Attacks," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LiDAR data from neighboring vehicles, which suggests that there may be datasets related to LiDAR scans or simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors mention validating their framework using a **CARLA simulation study**. This indicates that the CARLA simulator may be a source of data, but I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets derived from it.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the study. The authors reference various works related to LiDAR and autonomous vehicles, which could lead to datasets that are relevant to their research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly name any datasets but refer to the CARLA simulation environment. Therefore, I will document the CARLA simulator as a dataset source, as it is widely used in autonomous vehicle research.

The full citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on robot learning (pp. 1-16).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA simulator as the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
