To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Reinforcement Learning for Neural Motion Planning" by Tom Jurgenson and Aviv Tamar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a neural network trained on a set of solved motion planning problems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names or references.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe various scenarios (simple, hard, and vision) used for their experiments, which may imply the existence of datasets or data generation methods.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention generating a dataset of 1000 random obstacle configurations for the vision scenario, partitioned into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This indicates that there is a dataset used for training and testing their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the experiments, as it primarily discusses the methodology and results without referencing external datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Random Obstacle Configurations Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 random obstacle configurations used in the vision scenario, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing. The dataset is generated specifically for the experiments conducted in this paper.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is generated by the authors for the purpose of their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations as required, even if the citations are not from external sources. 

In summary, I will document the following dataset:
- **Random Obstacle Configurations Dataset**: Generated for the vision scenario experiments, consisting of 1000 configurations, with 80% for training and 20% for testing.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of full citations.
