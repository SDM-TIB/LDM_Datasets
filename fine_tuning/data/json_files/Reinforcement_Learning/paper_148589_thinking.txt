To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning 'What-If' Explanations for Sequential Decision-Making" by Ioana Bica et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the MIMIC III database, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present. The introduction further discusses the importance of modeling expert behavior in healthcare, hinting at the use of observational datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **MIMIC III database** for their case study on ICU patients receiving antibiotics. This is a crucial dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **experiments** section where the authors describe their methodology and results. They mention that they used **6631 patients** from the MIMIC III database, which provides specific details about the dataset's size and context.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC III dataset. The citation for the MIMIC III database is as follows:
> Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3:160035, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MIMIC III database, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
