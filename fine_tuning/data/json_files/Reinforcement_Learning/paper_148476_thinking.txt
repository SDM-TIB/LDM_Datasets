To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUTOHAS: EFFICIENT HYPERPARAMETER AND ARCHITECTURE SEARCH" by Xuanyi Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the efficiency of their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** (Section 3), where the authors detail their experiments. Here, they mention evaluating AutoHAS on **eight datasets**, including **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Places365**, and others. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly stated.

In the **experimental settings section** (C.1), the authors provide additional context about the datasets used, confirming that they are applying their method to **ImageNet** and **Places365**, among others. This section is crucial as it often contains specific details about the datasets, such as their characteristics or the tasks they are used for.

I will also check the **results section** (C.3) to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further insights into the datasets' performance metrics. They mention improvements on datasets like **Stanford Cars** and **Oxford Flower**, which I will include in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future research.

The full citations I will extract for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

4. **Places365**:
   > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2017.

5. **Stanford Cars**:
   > Fei-Fei Li, Rob Fergus, and Pietro Perona. *Learning Generative Visual Models from Few Training Examples: An Incremental Bayesian Approach Tested on 101 Object Categories*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011.

6. **Oxford Flower**:
   > M. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
