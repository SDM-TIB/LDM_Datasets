To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Q-Learning" by Rasool Fakoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on standard continuous-control benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks in this section. For instance, if the authors refer to specific environments or datasets used in their experiments, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MuJoCo simulator** for their experiments, I will look for the citation related to it in the references. The citation for MuJoCo is:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026â€“5033, 2012.

If they mention any specific tasks or environments, such as **Walker-2D**, **Half-Cheetah**, or others, I will ensure to find their respective citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, to ensure that they are well-documented and ready for further processing or review.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets in the experiments section.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for documentation.
