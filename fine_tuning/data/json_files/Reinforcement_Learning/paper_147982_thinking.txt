To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Maximum Entropy-Regularized Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning" by Rui Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a set of multi-goal robotic tasks from **OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that the datasets are likely related to robotic simulations.

I will look for specific names of the environments or tasks used in the experiments. In the paper, the authors refer to several environments, including **FetchPush, FetchPickAndPlace, FetchSlide, HandManipulateEgg, HandManipulateBlock, and HandManipulatePen**. These are the specific datasets or environments that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites **OpenAI Gym** as the source for the environments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **FetchPush**: A robotic manipulation task where the agent learns to push an object to a target location.
2. **FetchPickAndPlace**: A task where the agent picks up an object and places it at a specified location.
3. **FetchSlide**: A task where the agent slides an object to a target position.
4. **HandManipulateEgg**: A task involving manipulation of an egg with a robotic hand.
5. **HandManipulateBlock**: A task where the agent manipulates a block with a robotic hand.
6. **HandManipulatePen**: A task where the agent manipulates a pen with a robotic hand.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented for future reference or use in related research.
