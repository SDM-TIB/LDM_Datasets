To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Citizen centric optimal electric vehicle charging stations locations in a full city: case of Malaga" by Christian Cintrano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the problem being addressed, it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Locations (EV-CSL) problem and mention the use of real data from the municipality of Malaga, road maps from Open Street Maps, and electric substations locations. However, they do not provide specific dataset names yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors describe the scenario modeled for the city of Malaga. They mention that the scenario includes real data, specifically stating that it consists of 567,953 citizens in 363 neighborhoods and a total of 33,550 road segments as tentative locations for the charging stations. This section also mentions the actual locations of 14 electrical substations.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following sources:

1. **Open Street Maps**: This is a widely used dataset for geographic information and road maps. The citation for Open Street Maps is:
   > OpenStreetMap contributors. *Planet dump retrieved from https://planet.osm.org. https://www.openstreetmap.org* (2017).

2. **Municipality of Malaga**: The paper refers to open data provided by the municipality, but it does not specify a formal citation. However, I can note that the data is sourced from the local government.

3. **Electric substations data**: The authors mention that the data includes the locations and maximum energy flow capacity of the substations, but again, no specific citation is provided.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified. The key datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Open Street Maps**: A dataset providing road maps and geographic information for the city of Malaga.
- **Municipality of Malaga data**: Open data regarding the city's demographics and infrastructure, though lacking a formal citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future reference or processing.
