To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing Two-Player Stochastic Games with Soft Q-Learning" by Jordi Grau-Moya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments, including any specific games or environments they tested their methods on. I will pay close attention to any details regarding the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Pong" or a specific grid-world setup, I will look for the original sources or papers that introduced these datasets. If the dataset is widely known, I may also refer to its commonly accepted citation.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents or purpose, and the complete reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted before presenting it for review or further processing.
