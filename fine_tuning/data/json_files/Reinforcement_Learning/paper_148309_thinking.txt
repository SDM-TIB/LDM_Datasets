To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Imitation Learning via Fast Bayesian Reward Inference from Preferences" by Daniel S. Brown et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on Atari games, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to these games. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. I will pay particular attention to sections that discuss the evaluation of the proposed method, as they often contain details about the datasets used. 

In the **experiments** section, the authors describe their evaluation on various Atari games. They mention using demonstrations from these games, which implies that the datasets are related to the Atari Learning Environment. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to the original sources of these datasets.

I will also check the **references** section for any citations that might correspond to the datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

From my review, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: This is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks, which includes various Atari games. The authors mention using this environment for their experiments.

2. **Demonstration Data**: The paper discusses using demonstrations obtained from running Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on the ground truth reward function. While this may not be a traditional dataset, it is crucial for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

- For the **demonstration data**, since it is derived from the PPO algorithm, I will cite the relevant paper:
  > Dhariwal, P., Hesse, C., Klimov, O., Nichol, A., Plappert, M., Radford, A., Schulman, J., Sidor, S., Wu, Y., & Zhokhov, P. (2017). OpenAI baselines. *https://github.com/openai/baselines*.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
