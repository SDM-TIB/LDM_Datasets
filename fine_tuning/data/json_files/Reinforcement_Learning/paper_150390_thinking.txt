To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Play Text-based Adventure Games with Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning" by Weichen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the adaptation of the Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for text-based adventure games, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the use of text-based games as benchmarks for reinforcement learning but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors mention that the experiments are run on the **Jericho environment**. This environment categorizes games into three groups: possible games, difficult games, and extreme games. The authors specifically state that they focused on the possible and difficult games, which suggests that the Jericho environment itself is a dataset or a collection of datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the Jericho environment. The paper cites Hausknecht et al. (2020) for the Jericho Interactive Fiction environment, which is crucial for providing the full citation for the dataset.

The citation for the Jericho environment is:
> Hausknecht, M., Ammanabrolu, P., Côté, M.A., Yuan, X. *Interactive fiction games: A colossal adventure*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 7903–7910, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Jericho Environment**: This environment includes a collection of text-based adventure games categorized into possible, difficult, and extreme games, which serves as the dataset for the experiments conducted in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be easily accessed or referenced in future work.
