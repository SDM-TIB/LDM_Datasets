To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Multi-BS Power Management for Dense Radio Access Network using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Yuchao Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of power management in a dense radio access network, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This section typically provides details on the datasets employed in the research. If the authors conducted simulations, they might have used standard datasets or created their own, which should be detailed here.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the experiments section. However, they refer to simulation parameters and settings, which might imply the use of synthetic data generated for the experiments. I will need to confirm this by checking if they provide any references to existing datasets or if they describe the data generation process.

After reviewing the **references section**, I will look for any citations that might correspond to datasets. If the authors used existing datasets, they should provide full citations for those datasets in this section. If they created their own datasets, I will note that as well.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or references to existing datasets, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The authors conducted simulations based on parameters they defined, but no external datasets were cited.**

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant citations or notes about the absence of datasets. If there were any datasets mentioned, I would provide their full citations as required.

In conclusion, the extraction process involves identifying mentions of datasets in various sections of the paper, confirming their existence, and ensuring that full citations are provided for any datasets referenced.
