To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Comparison of Intrusion Detection Systems and Application of Machine Learning to Snort System" by Syed Ali Raza Shah and Biju Issac, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using three publicly available datasets for evaluating machine learning algorithms. I will note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of how these datasets were utilized in the context of the experiments. The authors detail the machine learning algorithms tested and the datasets used for performance evaluation, which will help confirm the datasets' relevance.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **NSA Snort IDS Alert Logs (SIDL, 2014)**: This dataset includes various attack types such as MAC Spoofing, DNS Poisoning, IP Spoofing, SSH Attacks, FTP Attacks, Scanning Attacks, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

2. **DARPA IDS Dataset**: This dataset contains various attack types, including User to Root Attack (U2R), Remote to Local Attack (R2L), and Probing Attack.

3. **NSL-KDD IDS Dataset**: This dataset is a refined version of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, which is commonly used for evaluating intrusion detection systems.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NSA Snort IDS Alert Logs**:
  > NSA Snort IDS Alert Logs (SIDL, 2014). Available at: [insert URL if available].

- For **DARPA IDS Dataset**:
  > DARPA IDS Dataset. Available at: http://www.ll.mit.edu/ideval/data/ (Accessed: October 2016).

- For **NSL-KDD IDS Dataset**:
  > NSL-KDD Dataset. Available at: http://nsl.cs.unb.ca/NSL-KDD/ (Accessed: 4 August 2015).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
