To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved robustness of reinforcement learning policies upon conversion to spiking neuronal network platforms applied to Atari Breakout game" by Devdhar Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or test environments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and may mention relevant datasets or environments used in their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that describe the experimental setup or the data used for training and testing the models. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a platform that allows researchers to test their algorithms on various Atari games, including Breakout. This is a significant dataset for reinforcement learning research.

I will also look for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks in the **results section**, where the authors may discuss the performance of their models on these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the Arcade Learning Environment, I will locate the original paper that describes it.

The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections to identify datasets.
2. Note the mention of the Arcade Learning Environment as a key dataset.
3. Find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment in the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the Arcade Learning Environment.
