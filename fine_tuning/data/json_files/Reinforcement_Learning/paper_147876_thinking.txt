To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Deep Q-learning Methods Robust to Time Discretization" by Corentin Tallec, LÃ©onard Blier, and Yann Ollivier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the sensitivity of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to time discretization but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any references to specific environments or datasets used for testing the proposed methods. The authors mention comparing their method (Deep Advantage Updating) against DDPG and DQN on classic control benchmarks, specifically naming environments like **Pendulum, Cartpole, BipedalWalker, Ant, and Half-Cheetah**. These are likely the datasets or environments used for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** and the **conclusion** to see if there are any additional mentions of datasets or benchmarks that might have been used in previous studies or comparisons.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for full citations in the **References section**. For example, the environments mentioned (like Pendulum and Cartpole) are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym.

For the other environments, I will ensure to find their respective citations or confirm that they are part of the OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific environments used in experiments (Pendulum, Cartpole, BipedalWalker, Ant, Half-Cheetah).
3. Check the references for full citations, particularly for OpenAI Gym.
4. Compile the datasets and citations into a structured format for further use.
