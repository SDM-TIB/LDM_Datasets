To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Improvement of Routing Protocols for Delay Tolerant Networks" by Michela Lorandi, Leonardo Lucio Custode, and Giovanni Iacca, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for testing the routing protocols.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on six test cases based on different urban maps and types of mobile nodes. I will look for specific names of datasets or simulation environments used in these experiments. The paper mentions using "The ONE (Opportunistic Network Environment)" for simulations, which is a crucial detail.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. They might provide insights into the performance metrics derived from the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or simulation environments mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same datasets.

Based on my reading, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. For example, if the paper mentions using "The ONE" simulator, I will include a citation for it, such as:

- The ONE Simulator: Keränen, Ari, Ott, Jörg, and Kärkkäinen, Teemu. "The ONE simulator for DTN protocol evaluation." In International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques, 2009.

After gathering all relevant information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for proper referencing.
