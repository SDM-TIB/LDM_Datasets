To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Radiance Field-Based Architecture for Intelligent Multilayered View Synthesis" by D. Dhinakaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be detailed.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments and how they impacted the results. This can provide additional context about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the paper, I may need to search for it online or in related literature to find the appropriate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
