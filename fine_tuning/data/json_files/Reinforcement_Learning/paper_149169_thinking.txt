To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Heuristic Multi-Agent Path Finding with Communication" by Ziyuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem and references various methods and frameworks, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VII) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their empirical evaluations. In this section, they mention using a "discrete gridworld environment" for their experiments, but they do not specify any external datasets. Instead, they describe how they set up their own environment for testing.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or specific datasets used in their experiments, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets relevant to the MAPF problem. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers discussing algorithms and methods rather than datasets.

Given that there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that the authors created their own experimental environment rather than using established datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are referenced.

In summary, my extraction process indicates that this paper does not utilize any external datasets, and thus there are no dataset citations to report. I will document this finding clearly to ensure that it is understood that the authors relied on a custom experimental setup rather than existing datasets.
