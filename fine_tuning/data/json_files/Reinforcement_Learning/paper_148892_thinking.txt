To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation In Reinforcement Learning Via Latent Unified State Representation" by Jinwei Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach in "variants of CarRacing games" and "CARLA, an autonomous driving simulator," indicating that these may be datasets or environments used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. They mention using "CarRacing variants" and "CARLA simulator" for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as the number of images collected or the nature of the data.

In the **CarRacing section**, the authors state that they collected "100k images" from the source domain and seen target domains, totaling "500k images." This indicates that the CarRacing dataset is a significant part of their work.

In the **CARLA section**, the authors describe using images captured by a camera attached to the vehicle for the driving task. They mention that the RL agent is trained in different weather conditions, but they do not specify the number of images or the exact dataset size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CarRacing dataset is commonly used in reinforcement learning research, but I will confirm its citation. The CARLA simulator is also well-known, and I will ensure to provide its citation as well.

For the **CarRacing dataset**, the citation is:
> "CarRacing: A Continuous Control Task for Reinforcement Learning." Available at: https://github.com/openai/gym.

For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
> Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., and Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, 1â€“16.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
