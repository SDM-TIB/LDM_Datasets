To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable Approach to Automated Severity Scoring in Pelvic Trauma" by Anna Zapaishchykova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for an automated approach to grading pelvic fractures and reference previous work. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in this context.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they obtained approval for the use of a dataset consisting of **373 admission CT scans of adult patients from two level I trauma centers**. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset, including its size and context.

The authors also reference a previous work in this section, which is essential for finding the full citation of the dataset. They mention that the dataset was initially described in a prior paper by Dreizin et al. (2021). I will need to locate this reference in the **References section** to provide the full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** for the citation of the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset of CT scans, the citation is:
  > Dreizin, D., Goldmann, F., LeBedis, C., Boscak, A., Dattwyler, M., Bodanapally, U., Li, G., Anderson, S., Maier, A., Unberath, M. *An automated deep learning method for tile ao/ota pelvic fracture severity grading from trauma whole-body ct*. Journal of Digital Imaging 34(1), 53â€“65 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-020-00400-5

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and characteristics, and ensure that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented.
