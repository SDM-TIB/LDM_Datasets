To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-Conditioned Q-Learning as Knowledge Distillation" by Alexander Levine and Soheil Feizi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section will typically include details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets used in the research. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements. This will involve formatting the information clearly, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete before finalizing the output. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
