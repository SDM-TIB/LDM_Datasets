To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instruct and Extract: Instruction Tuning for On-Demand Information Extraction" by Yizhu Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces a benchmark dataset called **INSTRUCTIE**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will navigate to **section 3 (INSTRUCTIE Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. Here, I will find the following details:

1. **INSTRUCTIE Dataset**: This dataset is constructed for the task of on-demand information extraction and consists of 14,579 training pairs and 150 manually curated test samples. The authors describe the dataset's purpose, structure, and the process of data generation, which is crucial for understanding its significance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may refer to the INSTRUCTIE dataset again, confirming its use in their evaluations. This will help solidify its importance in the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the INSTRUCTIE dataset. Since this dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite the paper as follows:

- For **INSTRUCTIE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yizhu Jiao, Ming Zhong, Sha Li, Ruining Zhao, Siru Ouyang, Heng Ji, and Jiawei Han. *Instruct and Extract: Instruction Tuning for On-Demand Information Extraction*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, December 7-11, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for INSTRUCTIE, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the dataset's purpose, structure, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
