To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Mean Field Games, with Applications to Economics" by Andrea Angiuli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the applications of mean field games in economics, as the title suggests. I will also check for any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Mean Field Capital Accumulation Dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is derived from a previously published work, I will ensure to cite that original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for future use or analysis.
