To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The state-of-the-art review on resource allocation problem using artificial intelligence methods on various computing paradigms" by Javad Hassannataj Joloudari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Methodology," "Experiments," or "Results."** These sections usually detail the datasets used for analysis or experimentation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the datasets employed in the study.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific applications. If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will ensure to capture each one distinctly.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
