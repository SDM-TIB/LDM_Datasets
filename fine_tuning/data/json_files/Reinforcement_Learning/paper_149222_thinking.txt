To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Otimização de Redes Neurais através de Algoritmos Genéticos Celulares" by Anderson Paulo da Silva and Teresa Bernarda Ludermir, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and may hint at the datasets used for testing the proposed algorithms.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Resultados Experimentais)**, where the authors discuss the experimental setup and the datasets used. Here, they mention that the experiments were conducted using ten datasets from the UCI repository, specifically listing them along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Crédito Alemão**: Contains data about potential credit clients, classifying them as good or bad payers.
2. **Ionosfera**: Contains data related to free electrons in the ionosphere, classifying whether there is a structure of electrons or not.
3. **Veículos**: Contains silhouette data of four different types of vehicles.
4. **Cavalos**: Contains data about horses with colic, predicting their survival, death, or need for euthanasia.
5. **Câncer**: Contains data for breast cancer diagnosis, classifying tumors as benign or malignant.
6. **Diabetes**: Contains data from individuals in an indigenous tribe, predicting diabetes onset.
7. **Vidros**: Contains data for classifying six different types of glass.
8. **Coração**: Contains data for heart disease diagnosis.
9. **Crédito Australiano**: Contains data about potential credit clients in Australia, classifying them as good or bad payers.
10. **Sonar**: Contains data about possible underwater mines, classifying them as mines or rocks.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are from the UCI repository, I will provide a general citation for the UCI repository itself, as individual datasets may not have separate citations.

The citation for the UCI repository is:
> Newman, D. J., Hettich, S., Blake, C. L., & Merz, C. J. (1998). UCI repository of machine learning databases. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCI repository as the source of the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
