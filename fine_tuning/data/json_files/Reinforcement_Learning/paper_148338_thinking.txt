To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Behavior Planning For Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Feedback Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Songyang Han and Fei Miao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing of their methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the behavior planning for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and mention using simulations and real-world data. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in the provided text. I will need to check if there are any references to datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections, as these sections often contain detailed descriptions of the data used.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to provide the original source of those datasets.

If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the paper relies on simulations or proprietary data, and I will document that accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are provided for any datasets referenced in the paper. This will ensure that the information is complete and ready for further processing or review.
