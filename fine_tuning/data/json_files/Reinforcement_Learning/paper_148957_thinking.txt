To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Play Soccer From Scratch: Sample-Efficient Emergent Coordination through Curriculum-Learning and Competition" by Pavan Samtani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a scheme for learning complex multi-agent behaviors in a sample-efficient manner, specifically applied to 2v2 soccer. This suggests that there may be datasets related to soccer simulations or environments used for training the agents.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference previous works and environments that have been open-sourced, which may indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks. I will note any names or descriptions that could refer to datasets.

I will then examine the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups. If the authors describe the environments or benchmarks used for training and testing, I will extract those details.

In this paper, the authors refer to the "environment introduced in [1]" which is likely a dataset or simulation environment. I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this source. The reference [1] is:
> S. Liu, G. Lever, N. Heess, J. Merel, S. Tunyasuvunakool, and T. Graepel, “Emergent coordination through competition,” in Int. Conf. on Learning Representations, 2019.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of the training curriculum stages (1v0, 1v1, and 2v2). If the authors refer to any specific datasets or environments used in these stages, I will document those as well.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I have found them in the references. This will ensure that the datasets are properly attributed and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
