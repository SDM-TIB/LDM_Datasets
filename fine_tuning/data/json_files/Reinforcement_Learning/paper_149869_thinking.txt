To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Task-Independent Game State Representations from Unlabeled Images" by Chintan Trivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors collected game footage frames and corresponding sequences of internal states from three different 3D games, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (The 3D-SSL Benchmark Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe three specific games and the corresponding dataset they created:

1. **ViZDoom**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,500 evaluation images, with 12 internal state variables related to enemy positions.

2. **CARLA**: This dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 20,108 evaluation images, with 7 internal state variables describing nearby traffic for the ego-vehicle.

3. **Google Research Football Environment (GRFE)**: This dataset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 evaluation images, with 94 internal state variables representing the positions and directions of players and the ball.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for each game environment:

- For **ViZDoom**, the citation is:
  > M. Kempka, M. Wydmuch, G. Runc, J. Toczek, and W. JaÅ›kowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, 2016.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning, 2017.

- For **Google Research Football Environment (GRFE)**, the citation is:
  > K. Kurach, A. Raichuk, P. Stanczyk, M. Zajac, O. Bachem, L. Espeholt, C. Riquelme, D. Vincent, M. Michalski, O. Bousquet et al. *Google Research Football: A novel reinforcement learning environment*. arXiv:1907.11180, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
