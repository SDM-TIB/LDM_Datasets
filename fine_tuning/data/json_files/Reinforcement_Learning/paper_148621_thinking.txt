To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A summary of the prevalence of Genetic Algorithms in Bioinformatics from 2015 onwards" by Mekaal Swerhun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, where the authors describe how they conducted their scoping review. This section may include details about the datasets used in the surveyed articles. I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as these are often included in such papers.

In the **Datasets section**, the authors explicitly mention various datasets used in the surveyed papers. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, including any specific details provided about them, such as the type of data, the number of samples, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the text, ensuring that I capture the correct source for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "UCSC Genome Browser" as a source for genomic data, I will find the appropriate citation for it, which might look something like this:
> Kent Ridge Biomedical Dataset website. *UCSC Genome Browser*. Available at: https://genome.ucsc.edu/.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have both the dataset name and its full citation.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future use.
