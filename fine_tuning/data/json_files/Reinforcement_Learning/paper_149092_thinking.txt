To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn to Intervene: An Adaptive Learning Policy for Restless Bandits in Application to Preventive Healthcare" by Arpita Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a maternal healthcare dataset used for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their work with a non-profit organization, ARMMAN, which provides a call-based program for pregnant women. They mention using data from this program, which suggests that the dataset is related to maternal healthcare and engagement behavior.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they simulate the intervention problem using call-records of enrolled beneficiaries, which includes information on how long they listened to calls and whether an intervention was given. This indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world interactions with the healthcare program.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions the organization ARMMAN and its program, which is likely the source of the dataset. However, it does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on the authors' collaboration with the organization.

To summarize the findings:
1. **Maternal Healthcare Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the call-based preventive care program run by ARMMAN, which includes call records of approximately 2.3 million pregnant women, detailing their engagement with the program.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset is associated with the ARMMAN organization and its program, but I cannot provide a complete citation as it is not explicitly mentioned in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and its source.
