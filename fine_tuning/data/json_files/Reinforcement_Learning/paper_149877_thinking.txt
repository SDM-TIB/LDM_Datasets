To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Level 2 Autonomous Driving on a Single Device: Diving into the Devils of Openpilot" by Li Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **nuScenes**: This dataset is described as a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving curated by Motional. It supports various tasks like detection, tracking, prediction, and segmentation. The authors provide details about its frame rate and the amount of valid video clips extracted.

2. **Comma2k19**: This dataset consists of over 33 hours of commute data collected in California's 280 highway. The authors believe it is a subset of the training data used for the Supercombo model.

In this section, the authors provide key features of both datasets, including their frame rates, lengths, and scenarios, which will be useful for the dataset descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **Comma2k19**, the citation is:
  > Harald Schafer, Eder Santana, Andrew Haden, and Riccardo Biasini. *A commute in data: The comma2k19 dataset*. arXiv:1812.05752, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
