To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multisensor fusion-based digital twin in additive manufacturing for in-situ quality monitoring and defect correction" by Lequn Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a multisensor fusion-based digital twin for quality monitoring, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the sensors used.

Next, I will focus on the **method overview** section, particularly **section 2.1**, where the authors describe the multisensor setup. They mention various sensors such as an acoustic sensor, an infrared thermal camera, a coaxial vision camera, and a laser line scanner. I will look for any specific datasets that may have been generated from these sensors.

In **section 3 (Multisensor Data Fusion)**, the authors detail the feature extraction from each sensor modality. They describe how data from the coaxial melt pool monitoring, in-situ acoustic monitoring, temperature field monitoring, and surface monitoring are collected and processed. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets but rather describe the types of data collected.

I will also check the **conclusion and future work** section to see if the authors mention any datasets that will be used for future machine learning models or analyses.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used. If the authors reference specific datasets or previous works that include datasets, I will note those citations.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets mentioned or referenced in the paper. If no specific datasets are named, I will summarize the types of data collected and their potential applications in the context of the research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the method overview for details on data collection and sensor modalities.
3. Review the data fusion section for insights into the types of data processed.
4. Check the conclusion for mentions of future datasets.
5. Look through the references for any relevant citations related to datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare the final output accordingly.
