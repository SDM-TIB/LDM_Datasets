To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning against Adversarial Perturbations on State Observations" by Huan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **experiments** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. This section may provide additional details about the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **Atari game environments** as a dataset, I would look for the original source or citation for these environments in the references.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
