To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Routing: Track-Assignment Detailed Routing Using Attention-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Haiguang Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the attention router on "different commercial advanced technologies analog circuits problem sets," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention two problem sets: **Small** and **Large**, which consist of analog design problems based on commercial advanced node technologies. The Small problem set includes various placement solutions for Comparators and OpAmps, while the Large problem set consists of placement solutions for Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). However, I need to find specific dataset names and their details.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the attention router's training and testing. The authors describe using different training sets, such as Small100, Small500, Small5000, Large100, and Large500, which indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are derived from the authors' own experiments and not from external sources, I will cite the paper itself for each dataset:

1. **Small Problem Set**: This dataset includes various analog design problems with instTerms ranging from 10 to 100.
   - Citation: Liao, H., Zhang, W., Qi, W., Dong, Q., Dong, X., Zhang, W., & Kara, L. B. (2020). Attention Routing: Track-Assignment Detailed Routing Using Attention-Based Reinforcement Learning. In Proceedings of the ASME 2020 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/DAC 2020), St. Louis, USA.

2. **Large Problem Set**: This dataset consists of different placement solutions for Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) with instTerms ranging from 100 to 1000.
   - Citation: Liao, H., Zhang, W., Qi, W., Dong, Q., Dong, X., Zhang, W., & Kara, L. B. (2020). Attention Routing: Track-Assignment Detailed Routing Using Attention-Based Reinforcement Learning. In Proceedings of the ASME 2020 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/DAC 2020), St. Louis, USA.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper. This will allow for proper referencing and understanding of the datasets in future work or discussions.
