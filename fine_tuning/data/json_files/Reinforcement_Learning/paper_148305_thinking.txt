To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Listwise Learning to Rank with Deep Q-Networks" by Abhishek Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors ran their algorithm against **Microsoftâ€™s LETOR listwise dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the author provides more details about the dataset used. Here, it is confirmed that the LETOR dataset is utilized, and the author describes its structure, including that each row represents a query-document pair and includes features such as query ID and rank label.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LETOR dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **LETOR Dataset**: 
  > Qin, T., Liu, T. Y., Xu, J., & Li, H. (2010). LETOR: A benchmark collection for research on learning to rank for information retrieval. *Information Retrieval*, 13(4), 346-374.

Since the paper primarily discusses the LETOR dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: LETOR
2. **Description**: A benchmark collection for research on learning to rank for information retrieval, where each row represents a query-document pair with features like query ID and rank label.
3. **Citation**: Qin, T., Liu, T. Y., Xu, J., & Li, H. (2010). LETOR: A benchmark collection for research on learning to rank for information retrieval. *Information Retrieval*, 13(4), 346-374.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
