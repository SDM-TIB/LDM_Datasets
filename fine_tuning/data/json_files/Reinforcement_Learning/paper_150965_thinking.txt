To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Post-Hoc Case-Based Explanation with Feature Highlighting" by Eoin M. Kenny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithms were tested on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Method and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **CUB-200 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for fine-tuning ResNet34. It is known for containing images of birds, categorized into 200 species.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset used for training and testing deep learning models, specifically mentioning that it encompasses over 1 million images.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that both datasets were utilized in their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUB-200 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. Computation & Neural Systems Technical Report 2010-001. California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited as per the requirements.
