To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Inference for Consumer Choice Across Many Product Categories" by Rob Donnelly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the model using held-out data from weeks with price changes or out-of-stock products, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Supermarket Application)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the data used for their analysis. Here, they mention that the data originates from a supermarket loyalty program and includes detailed transaction data over a period of 23 months. This section is likely to contain crucial information about the dataset.

In subsection 4.1, the authors specify that they used scanner panel data from a single store in a national grocery chain, which includes:
- **2068 households** making **1,551,213 purchases** during **333,585 shopping trips**.
- The data includes product prices, quantities purchased, and household demographic variables.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset originally assembled by Che et al. (2012), which is likely relevant for the analysis.

The citation for this dataset is:
> Che, H., Chen, X. J., & Chen, Y. (2012). Investigating Effects of Out-of-Stock on Consumer Stockkeeping Unit Choice. *Journal of Marketing Research*, 49(4), 502â€“513. doi:10.1509/jmr.09.0528.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. The key datasets identified are:
1. **Supermarket Scanner Panel Data**: Contains transaction data from a loyalty program over 23 months, including purchases, prices, and demographics.
2. **Che et al. (2012) Dataset**: Used for analysis related to out-of-stock effects.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
