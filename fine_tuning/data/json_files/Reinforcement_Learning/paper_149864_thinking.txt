To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-GA: A Reinforcement Learning-Based Genetic Algorithm for Electromagnetic Detection Satellite Scheduling Problem" by Yanjie Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets relevant to their research. This section often provides context and may reference existing datasets that are foundational to the study.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection methods. This is where the authors are likely to describe the datasets they used, including any specific characteristics or sources.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may provide details about the datasets, such as their size, type, and any relevant attributes that are important for understanding the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "AGI Systems Tool Kit (STK) 11.2" for generating task and time window data, I will look for the full citation in the references. If they refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to capture those citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information for future reference.
