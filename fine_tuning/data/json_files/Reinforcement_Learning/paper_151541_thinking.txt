To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADDOPT: An Additive Manufacturing Optimal Control Framework Demonstrated in Minimizing Layer-Level Thermal Variance in Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion" by Mikhail Khrenov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and implementation sections**. These sections often detail the experimental setup and any datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets, which will help confirm the datasets' relevance.

I will also review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

Based on the content of the paper, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **EB-PBF Process Model Dataset**: This dataset includes experimental measurements and simulations related to the electron beam powder bed fusion process. It is essential for validating the proposed optimal control framework.

2. **Material Properties Dataset**: This dataset contains the thermal properties of the materials used in the experiments, such as thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat capacity. These properties are critical for modeling the additive manufacturing process accurately.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper. This will ensure that I have the necessary information to create a comprehensive record of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
