To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Pareto Efficient Fairness-Utility Trade-off in Recommendation through Reinforcement Learning" by Yingqiang Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "several real-world recommendation datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list three datasets:

1. **Movielens**: The authors specify that they used the Movielens100K dataset, which includes about one hundred thousand user transactions. This dataset is widely recognized in the recommendation system community.

2. **Ciao**: This dataset was collected from a popular product review site, Epinions, and includes user profiles, ratings, and trust relations. The authors provide a brief description of its contents, which helps confirm its relevance.

3. **Etsy**: The authors mention that they collected user-item interaction data from Etsy, a well-known e-commerce platform. They also describe the filtering process for this dataset, which adds context to its use.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets mentioned are commonly known, so I will provide their standard citations based on existing literature:

- For **Movielens**:
  > GroupLens Research. *Movielens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- For **Ciao**:
  > Tang, J., Gao, H., Liu, H., & Das Sarma, A. (2012). *ETrust: Understanding Trust Evolution in an Online World*. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD (KDD '12). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339574

- For **Etsy**:
  > The dataset is not formally published in a specific paper, but it is collected from Etsy's user-item interaction data. Therefore, I will note it as:
  > Etsy Inc. *User-item interaction data*. Internal dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
