To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actor-Expert: A Framework for using Q-learning in Continuous Action Spaces" by Sungsu Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section usually details the datasets used for training and evaluation, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using several benchmark environments for their experiments. Specifically, I will note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Pendulum**: A continuous control environment where the goal is to swing the pendulum upright.
2. **HalfCheetah**: A continuous control environment simulating a cheetah-like figure moving forward.
3. **Hopper**: A continuous control environment simulating a monoped figure moving forward.
4. **Ant**: A continuous control environment simulating a quadruped figure moving forward.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Pendulum**: 
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583*.

- **HalfCheetah**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*.

- **Hopper**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*.

- **Ant**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
