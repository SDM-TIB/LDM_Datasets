To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Your Room is not Private: Gradient Inversion Attack on Reinforcement Learning" by Miao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the AI2THOR simulator for experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this simulator.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the AI2THOR simulator, indicating that it is a key component of their experiments. I will also check if they mention any other datasets or benchmarks that are used for validation.

In the **methodology and experiments sections**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention conducting experiments on the active perception task using the AI2THOR simulator. I will need to confirm if the AI2THOR dataset itself is referenced as a dataset or if it is merely the environment used for the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the AI2THOR simulator or any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset.

From my reading, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **AI2THOR Simulator**: This is a platform used for conducting experiments in embodied AI. The paper does not provide a specific dataset citation for AI2THOR, but it is essential to note that it serves as the environment for the experiments.

The citation for the AI2THOR simulator is:
   > E. Kolve, R. Mottaghi, W. Han, E. VanderBilt, L. Weihs, A. Herrasti, M. Deitke, K. Ehsani, D. Gordon, Y. Zhu, et al., “AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05474, 2017.

Next, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AI2THOR simulator as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all necessary details are included and that the citation is accurate and complete.
