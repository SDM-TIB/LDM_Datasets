To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rationale-aware Autonomous Driving Policy utilizing Safety Force Field implemented on CARLA Simulator" by Ho Suk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or implementations. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training or testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any mention of the **CARLA simulator**, as it is a key component of the research. The authors may refer to datasets generated or used within this simulator environment.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Once I have the names and descriptions of the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CARLA simulator**, I will look for the citation that corresponds to it:
- For the CARLA simulator, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator. In 2017 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL). PMLR.

If they mention any other datasets, such as specific traffic scenarios or datasets used for training the claimed set predictor, I will ensure to extract those names and their corresponding citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, to create a comprehensive overview that can be formatted as needed for further processing or review.
