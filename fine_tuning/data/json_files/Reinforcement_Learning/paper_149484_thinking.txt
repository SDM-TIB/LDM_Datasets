To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Data Distribution on Q-learning with Function Approximation" by Pedro P. Santos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on data distribution and its effects on Q-learning algorithms, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Assessing the Impact of Data Distribution in Oï¬„ine RL)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention evaluating the performance of algorithms under various environments, which suggests that specific datasets were employed.

In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **Grid 1 and Grid 2 Environments**: These are tabular environments with specific configurations for testing the algorithms. The authors mention that the datasets consist of state-action pairs generated from these environments.

2. **Multi-path Environment**: This environment consists of multiple paths that the agent can take, and the dataset is generated based on the agent's interactions within this environment.

3. **Pendulum, Cartpole, and Mountaincar Environments**: These are standard environments from the OpenAI Gym, and the authors indicate that they used datasets generated from these environments as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors may reference foundational papers or datasets that are critical to their research.

For example, the citations for the environments might include:

- For **Grid 1 and Grid 2**: The authors may cite foundational works on grid environments or reinforcement learning benchmarks.
- For **Multi-path Environment**: If this environment is based on previous research, I will look for citations related to similar multi-path studies.
- For **Pendulum, Cartpole, and Mountaincar**: These environments are well-known, and I will ensure to cite the original OpenAI Gym paper:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
