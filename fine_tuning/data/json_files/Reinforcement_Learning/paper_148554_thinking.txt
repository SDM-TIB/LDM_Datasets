To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Network Level Traffic Signal Control" by Jin Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research, and if datasets are used, they may be mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this paper, the author mentions using a **SUMO-based simulation platform** to mimic traffic evolution, which suggests that the datasets are likely generated from simulations rather than real-world data.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources in the **experiments section**. For instance, the author describes a **4Ã—4 grid network** and mentions **traffic demands assigned with predefined routes/turning ratios and flow rates**, indicating that the data is structured around these parameters. 

Additionally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or methodologies that involve datasets. If the paper references other works that provide datasets, I will note those citations as well.

In this paper, the author does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets but rather describes the simulation setup and the parameters used for generating traffic data. Therefore, I will summarize the relevant information about the simulated datasets:

1. **SUMO Simulation Data**: The paper utilizes the SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) platform to create a simulated environment for traffic signal control. The data generated includes vehicle trajectories, queue lengths, and traffic flow rates based on the defined traffic demands.

2. **Traffic Demand Data**: The traffic demands are generated based on a **Poisson distribution** with various trip generating probabilities, which are specified in the experiments section.

Since there are no formal datasets cited from external sources, I will note the simulation data and its parameters as the primary dataset used in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the methodologies or tools used to generate the datasets, such as the SUMO platform.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly, referencing the original sources where applicable, particularly for the SUMO simulation tool and any related methodologies discussed in the paper.
