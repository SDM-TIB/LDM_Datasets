To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Model for Predictive Maintenance Planning of Road Assets: Integrating LCA and LCCA" by Mobin Latifi Nowsoud, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes **Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) data**, which suggests that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the importance of sustainable infrastructure and mentions the use of LTPP data in various studies, confirming its relevance to the research.

In the **data section**, the paper explicitly states that the **LTPP dataset** is adopted for the study. It describes the dataset as containing several indicators related to flexible pavements, such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and Rutting Depth (RD). This section provides a clear identification of the dataset used in the research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LTPP dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the LTPP dataset itself, but it is widely recognized in the field. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the LTPP dataset:

- **Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) dataset**:
  > U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. *Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Program*. Available at: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/research/tfhrc/projects/infrastructure/pavements/ltpp/

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the LTPP dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted and documented the dataset from the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
