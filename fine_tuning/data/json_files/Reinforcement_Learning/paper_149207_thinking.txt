To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Traffic Signal Control Optimization" by Zhenning Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated via simulation on the **Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)** platform, which indicates that this is a key dataset or simulation environment used in the research.

Next, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses various adaptive signal control technologies but does not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe the traffic network used for evaluation.

In the **numerical experiments section**, the authors state that the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a real-world traffic network extracted from **Montgomery County, Maryland**. This indicates that the traffic data from this location is a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)**: The citation for this simulation platform is:
   > Krajzewicz, D., Erdmann, J., Behrisch, M., & Bieker, L. (2012). Recent development and applications of SUMO-Simulation of Urban MObility. *International Journal On Advances in Systems and Measurements*, 5(3&4).

2. **Montgomery County Traffic Data**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the traffic data from Montgomery County, it references the **Montgomery-National Capital Park and Planning Commission** for the Origin-Destination (OD) matrices and the **Maryland Department of Transportation** for traffic volumes. Therefore, I will note these sources as part of the dataset description:
   > Montgomery-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. (n.d.). Origin-Destination Matrices. 
   > Maryland Department of Transportation. (n.d.). Traffic Volume Data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
