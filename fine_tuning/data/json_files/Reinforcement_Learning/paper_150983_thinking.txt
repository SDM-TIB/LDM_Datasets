To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADAMM: Anomaly Detection of Attributed Multi-graphs with Metadata: A Unified Neural Network Approach" by Konstantinos Sotiropoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on datasets from two different domains: accounting and human mobility. This suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. In this case, I find that the authors summarize their datasets in **section IV (Experiments)**, where they describe the datasets used for evaluation.

The paper mentions four datasets:

1. **SH Dataset**: This dataset consists of annual general-ledger journal entries from a firm, capturing itemized transactions between accounts along with metadata such as entry and effective dates, requester, and approver.

2. **KD Dataset**: Similar to the SH dataset, this dataset also contains annual journal entries from a different firm, with comparable metadata.

3. **HW Dataset**: This dataset follows the same structure as the SH and KD datasets, containing journal entries and associated metadata.

4. **MobiNet Dataset**: This dataset includes simulated human GPS trajectories, which are used to extract daily activity graphs of places visited by agents, along with metadata about individual trips.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **SH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. J. Liang. "Bookkeeping graphs: Computational theory and applications." Foundations and Trends® in Accounting, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 77–172, 2023.

- For the **KD Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the SH dataset, as it is also part of the same research context.

- For the **HW Dataset**, the citation is again the same as for the SH dataset, as it is part of the same research context.

- For the **MobiNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. M. Schneider, V. Belik, T. Couronné, Z. Smoreda, and M. C. González. "Unravelling daily human mobility motifs." Journal of The Royal Society Interface, vol. 10, no. 84, p. 20130246, 2013.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **SH Dataset** - Annual general-ledger journal entries.
   - Citation: P. J. Liang. "Bookkeeping graphs: Computational theory and applications." Foundations and Trends® in Accounting, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 77–172, 2023.

2. **KD Dataset** - Annual general-ledger journal entries from a different firm.
   - Citation: P. J. Liang. "Bookkeeping graphs: Computational theory and applications." Foundations and Trends® in Accounting, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 77–172, 2023.

3. **HW Dataset** - Annual general-ledger journal entries from another firm.
   - Citation: P. J. Liang. "Bookkeeping graphs: Computational theory and applications." Foundations and Trends® in Accounting, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 77–172, 2023.

4. **MobiNet Dataset** - Simulated human GPS trajectories.
   - Citation: C. M. Schneider, V. Belik, T. Couronné, Z. Smoreda, and M. C. González. "Unravelling daily human mobility motifs." Journal of The Royal Society Interface, vol. 10, no. 84, p. 20130246, 2013.

With this information, I will be ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or documentation.
