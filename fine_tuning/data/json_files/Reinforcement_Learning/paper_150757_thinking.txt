To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Endogenous Macrodynamics in Algorithmic Recourse" by Patrick Altmeyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for simulation experiments involving various benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the methodology or experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology in detail. Here, they mention using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Specifically, they list four synthetic binary classification datasets: **Overlapping, Linearly Separable, Circles, and Moons**, each consisting of 1,000 samples. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention three real-world datasets:
1. **Give Me Some Credit Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether a borrower is likely to experience financial difficulties in the next two years. It originally consists of 250,000 instances with 11 numerical attributes.
2. **UCI Default Credit Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for predicting whether credit card clients default on their payment, consisting of 23 explanatory variables.
3. **California Housing Dataset**: Derived from the 1990 U.S. census, this dataset consists of 8 continuous features used to predict median house prices.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Give Me Some Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. "Give Me Some Credit: Improve on the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years." Kaggle, 2011. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit.

For the **UCI Default Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yeh, I.-C., & Lien, C. (2009). "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients." *Expert Systems with Applications*, 36(2), 2473-2480.

For the **California Housing Dataset**, the citation is:
> Pedregosa, F., et al. (2011). "Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python." *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 12, 2825-2830.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
