To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formal Fields: A Framework to Automate Code Generation Across Domains" by Jacques BasaldÃºa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its application to the Abstract Reasoning Challenge (ARC), which suggests that there may be datasets related to this challenge.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author mentions specific datasets or challenges that involve datasets. The introduction discusses the ARC challenge, which is a key component of the research, indicating that there may be a dataset associated with it.

In the **results section**, the author summarizes the performance of the implementation on the ARC challenge, stating that the system solved a total of 168 problems, including 22 previously unsolved problems. This section may provide insights into the dataset used for evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The author mentions the ARC challenge and provides a link to the dataset used in the experiments. This is crucial for obtaining the full citation.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Abstract Reasoning Challenge (ARC)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It consists of a set of intelligence tests designed to assess the ability of agents to learn patterns from examples and apply them to unseen problems.

The full citation for the ARC dataset is:
> Chollet, F. (2019a). The measure of intelligence. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.01547. Available at: https://github.com/fchollet/ARC.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ARC dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.
