To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient State Representation Learning for Dynamic Robotic Scenarios" by Zhaorun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it might hint at the types of environments or scenarios used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets or environments used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three simulation environments: **MobileRobot**, **Omnirobot**, and **Jaka**. I will note these environments as they are likely the datasets or scenarios used for testing the proposed algorithm.

I will also check the **appendix** and **references** sections for any additional details or citations related to these environments. The references may provide insights into the original sources or papers that describe these environments in detail.

For each identified dataset or environment, I will ensure to document the following:

1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the environment or dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset or environment entails, including its purpose and any relevant details about its structure or content.
3. **Full Citation**: I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these environments to provide accurate citations.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. 

Now, I will proceed to extract the relevant information from the paper and prepare the dataset documentation accordingly.
