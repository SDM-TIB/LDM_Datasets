To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Proximal Policy Optimization Based Intelligent Home Solar Management" by Kode Creer and Imtiaz Parvez, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and background, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized. In this case, the authors mention using data from the **2016 NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)** and **US Energy Information Administration**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, or specific variables used in the analysis. This section may also confirm the datasets' relevance to the experiments conducted.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details to properly attribute the datasets used in the research.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include:

1. **NREL Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which provides data on renewable energy generation and consumption.

2. **US Energy Information Administration Dataset**: This dataset includes various energy statistics and metrics relevant to the study.

I will ensure to format the citations correctly, as follows:

- For the **NREL dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Renewable Energy Laboratory. *2016 Renewable Energy Data*. Available at: [NREL website link].

- For the **US Energy Information Administration dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Energy Information Administration. *Annual Energy Outlook 2016*. Available at: [EIA website link].

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
