To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Representations from Non-Disentangled Models" by Valentin Khrulkov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of disentangled representations and mention various models and approaches, but I need to look for explicit dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **3D Shapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 480,000 images with 6 factors of variation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Burgess, C. and Kim, H. *3D Shapes Dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/3dshapes-dataset/, 2018.

2. **MPI3D Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,036,800 images with 7 factors of variation. The citation is:
   > Gondal, M. W., Wuthrich, M., Miladinovic, D., Locatello, F., Breidt, M., Volchkov, V., Akpo, J., Bachem, O., Schölkopf, B., and Bauer, S. *On the transfer of inductive bias from simulation to the real world: a new disentanglement dataset*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 15740–15751, 2019.

3. **Cars3D Dataset**: This dataset includes 17,568 images with 3 factors of variation. The citation is:
   > Fidler, S., Dickinson, S., and Urtasun, R. *3D object detection and viewpoint estimation with a deformable 3D cuboid model*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 611–619, 2012; Reed, S. E., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., and Lee, H. *Deep visual analogy-making*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1252–1260, 2015.

4. **Isaac3D Dataset**: This dataset contains 737,280 images with 9 factors of variation. The citation is:
   > Nie, W., Karras, T., Garg, A., Debhath, S., Patney, A., Patel, A. B., and Anandkumar, A. *Semi-Supervised StyleGAN for Disentanglement Learning*. International Conference on Machine Learning, 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper.
