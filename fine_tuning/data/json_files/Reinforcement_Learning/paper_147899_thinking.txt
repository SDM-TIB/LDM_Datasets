To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unifying Ensemble Methods for Q-learning via Social Choice Theory" by Rishav Chourasia and Adish Singla, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses ensemble methods in reinforcement learning but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about the methods used but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. Here, they mention several grid-world environments and a corridor MDP. I will look for specific names of datasets or environments that can be considered datasets for the purpose of this extraction.

In **Section 5.1 (Environments)**, the authors list the following environments used for evaluation:

1. **Corridor MDP**: A linear chain of 50 states with specific reward structures.
2. **MiniGrid-DoorKey-16x16-v0**: A grid-world environment where the objective is to reach a checkpoint.
3. **MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N6-v0**: Another grid-world environment with a different objective.
4. **MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS4R3-v0**: A grid-world environment focused on navigating through a corridor.
5. **MiniGrid-ObstructedMaze-2Dl-v0**: A grid-world environment with obstacles.

These environments are described in detail, including their characteristics and objectives, which makes them suitable for inclusion as datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are likely derived from existing frameworks (like OpenAI Gym), I will look for the original sources or documentation for these environments.

For the **MiniGrid environments**, the citation is:
> Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

For the **Corridor MDP**, since it is a specific setup described in the paper, I will note that it is a custom environment created for the experiments, and thus may not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Corridor MDP**: Custom environment described in the paper.
2. **MiniGrid-DoorKey-16x16-v0**: 
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.
3. **MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N6-v0**: 
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.
4. **MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS4R3-v0**: 
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.
5. **MiniGrid-ObstructedMaze-2Dl-v0**: 
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert and Lucas Willems. *Minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym*. https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid, 2018.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
