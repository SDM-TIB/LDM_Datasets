To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Management in a Cooperative Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network" by Arghyadeep Barat, Prabuchandran K.J, and Shalabh Bhatnagar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EHWSNs) and mention various mechanisms and algorithms but do not explicitly name any datasets. I will continue to the methodology section.

In the **methodology**, particularly in the sections discussing simulations and experiments, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed models. The authors may describe the simulation setup, including parameters and data sources.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for comparison with their proposed methods. They may refer to existing datasets or benchmarks that are commonly used in the field of energy harvesting wireless sensor networks.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the authors reference specific datasets, I will ensure to note down the following for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation as provided in the references section of the paper.

If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
