To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Randomized Ensembled Double Q-Learning: Learning Fast Without a Model" by Xinyue Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on the **MuJoCo benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark may be a dataset or a collection of datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments, which indicates that the MuJoCo physics engine is the dataset they are referring to.

I will then check the **references** section to find the full citation for the MuJoCo dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MuJoCo** dataset, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is the **MuJoCo benchmark**, and its full citation is provided above. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
