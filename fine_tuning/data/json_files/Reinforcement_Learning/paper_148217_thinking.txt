To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Optimization Reinforcement Learning with Entropy Regularization" by Jingbin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods outperform prior works on a range of benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on specific environments, particularly mentioning the **OpenAI Gym environments** such as "pendulum-v0" and "breakout." This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these environments in the paper. The authors provide links to their implementations, which may also lead to more information about the datasets used. 

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for the OpenAI Gym environment is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., et al. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

2. **Atari57**: The Atari environments are referenced in the context of reinforcement learning benchmarks. The citation for the Atari environments is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

3. **Pendulum-v0**: This is a specific environment within the OpenAI Gym, so it does not have a separate citation but is included in the OpenAI Gym citation.

4. **Breakout**: Similar to "pendulum-v0," this is also part of the Atari environments and is included in the Atari citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
