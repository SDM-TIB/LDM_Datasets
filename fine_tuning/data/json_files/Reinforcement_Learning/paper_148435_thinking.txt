To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experience Augmentation: Boosting and Accelerating Off-Policy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Zhenhui Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method in various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **Section 4.1 (Environments)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They mention three specific tasks:

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: This environment involves multiple agents and landmarks, where agents must occupy all landmarks while avoiding collisions. The details about the dataset are not explicitly mentioned, but the environment setup is crucial for understanding the context.

2. **UAV used for Mobile Base Station**: This scenario involves UAVs acting as mobile base stations to cover points of interest (PoIs). Again, while the dataset specifics are not detailed, the environment description is essential.

3. **World with Communication**: This environment consists of predators and preys, where the agents must work together to catch the preys. The description provides insight into the dataset's nature but does not provide a formal citation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors do not provide formal dataset citations but describe the environments in detail. Therefore, I will need to look at the **References section** to find any related works that might have introduced these environments or datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the environments are based on the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), which is a well-known benchmark in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The citation for MPE is:

- For MPE, the citation is:
  > Ryan Lowe, Yi I Wu, Aviv Tamar, Jean Harb, OpenAI Pieter Abbeel, and Igor Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 6379â€“6390, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the environments mentioned in the paper.

1. **Cooperative Navigation**: Environment for multi-agent coordination.
   - Citation: Lowe et al. (2017).

2. **UAV used for Mobile Base Station**: Environment for UAVs providing communication services.
   - Citation: Lowe et al. (2017).

3. **World with Communication**: Environment for predator-prey interactions.
   - Citation: Lowe et al. (2017).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details and citations.
