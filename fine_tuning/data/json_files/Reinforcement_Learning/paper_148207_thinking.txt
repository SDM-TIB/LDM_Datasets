To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Soft Actor-Critic with Multivariate Reward Representation and Knowledge Distillation" by Dmitry Akimov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the experiments and methodology**. The abstract mentions participation in the NeurIPS 2019 Learning to Move - Walk Around challenge, which suggests that there is a specific dataset or environment used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Environment and Reinforcement Learning)**, where the author describes the competition environment. Here, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets or environments used in the experiments. The paper refers to a "physics-based environment" and provides a link to the environment page, which may contain additional details about the dataset.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of training and evaluation. The author discusses the architecture and hyperparameters used for training the agent, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly named.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references the NeurIPS 2019 Learning to Move competition, which may have its own citation or reference to the dataset used.

If I find specific datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note their full citations. For instance, if the paper refers to the environment used in the competition, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this environment in detail.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine section 2 for details about the environment and any datasets used.
3. Review section 4 for specific mentions of datasets in the experiments.
4. Check the References section for full citations related to the datasets or environments.
5. Compile the identified datasets and their citations for further processing.
