To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design and Comparison of Reward Functions in Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Sensor Nodes" by Yohann Rioual et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the data used. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize data or datasets, as well as any references to specific datasets used in their experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the energy management of sensor nodes and mention various experiments with different reward functions. They refer to the use of a **kinetic motion energy harvester** and provide data on the **power harvested** from different activities (relaxing, walking, running). This indicates that there are datasets related to energy harvesting capabilities.

I will also check for any **tables** that summarize the energy consumption of the sensor node components and the harvested power for different activities. For example, **Table I** and **Table III** provide relevant data that could be considered datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to other works or datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For the datasets identified in this paper, I will note the following:

1. **Kinetic Motion Energy Harvesting Data**: This dataset includes the power harvested from different activities (relaxing, walking, running) as shown in **Table III**. The data points are:
   - Relaxing: 2.4 µW
   - Walking: 180.3 µW
   - Running: 678.3 µW

2. **Energy Consumption Data**: This dataset includes the energy consumption of various components of the sensor node as summarized in **Table II**. The components and their respective current consumption in active and sleep modes are:
   - Heart rate sensor: Active - 1.6 mA, Sleep - 0.12 mA
   - Micro-controller: Active - 225 µA/MHz, Sleep - 0.93 µA
   - BLE transmitter: Active - 10.5 mA, Sleep - 0 µA

Next, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. If the authors cite specific studies or datasets, I will ensure to include those citations accurately.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format, ready for further processing or review.
