To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A study on a Q-Learning algorithm application to a manufacturing assembly problem" by Miguel Neves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on a Q-Learning algorithm applied to an assembly problem, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are often described. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Benchmark Dataset** for their assembly problem involving an aeroplane toy. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset in the **results section** or any other relevant sections. The authors describe the aeroplane object and its components, indicating that they are using specific parts from the dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide further datasets or additional references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Benchmark Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Calli, J., Singh, A., Walsman, A., Srinivasa, S., Abbeel, P., & Dollar, A. M. (2015). The YCB Object and Model Set: Towards Common Benchmarks for Manipulation Research. In *2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)* (pp. 510â€“517).

Since the paper primarily focuses on the application of the Q-Learning algorithm and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the findings into a structured format.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Benchmark Dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
