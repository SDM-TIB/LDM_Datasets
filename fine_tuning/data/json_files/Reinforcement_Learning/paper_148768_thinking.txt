To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Principle of Least Action with Reinforcement Learning" by Zehao Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning to learn the physical trajectory of particles, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the application of reinforcement learning in physics but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiment section** where they describe their methodology and results.

In the **experiment section**, the authors detail their setup for training the reinforcement learning agent, including the environment and parameters used. They mention using a three-layer grid environment consisting of materials like air, water, and glass, but they do not refer to any formal datasets or publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to datasets used in their experiments, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, I will still check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works might refer to datasets that could be relevant to the experiments described. The references primarily cite works related to reinforcement learning and physics but do not provide specific datasets.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that it does not contain any explicit datasets or references to datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in this research paper.
