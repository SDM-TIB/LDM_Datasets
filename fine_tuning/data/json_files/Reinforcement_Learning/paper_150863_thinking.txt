To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Puneet S. Bagga and Arthur Delarue, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a "large dataset of synthetic instances" for training the model, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but it does not provide a specific name.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data and setup)**, where the authors describe how they generated their dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of QAP instances generated by sampling locations uniformly at random in a two-dimensional unit square and creating a symmetric flow matrix. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it is synthetic and generated for the purpose of the study.

Since the dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation or reference, I will note that it is a generated dataset without a specific title. I will also document the details provided in the paper about how the dataset was created, as this information is relevant for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any datasets mentioned that are commonly used in the field of combinatorial optimization or reinforcement learning. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not mention any specific datasets that are used in this study.

In summary, I will create an entry for the synthetic dataset used in the paper, detailing its generation process and the context in which it was used, but I will note that it does not have a formal citation since it is not a publicly available dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of the dataset as described in the paper, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation while providing the necessary details about its generation and use.
