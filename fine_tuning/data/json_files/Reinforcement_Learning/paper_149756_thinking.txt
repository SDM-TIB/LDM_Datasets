To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Learning of Reward Machines and Policies in Environments with Partially Known Semantics" by Christos K. Verginis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed algorithms. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "HouseExpo," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it online or in related literature to ensure I have the correct reference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their descriptions in the methodology and experiments sections.
3. Locate full citations for each dataset in the references section or through external searches.
4. Compile the dataset information for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
