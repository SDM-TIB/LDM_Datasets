To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Munchausen Reinforcement Learning using Tsallis KL Divergence" by Lingwei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and may include specific datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the datasets.

If the paper discusses experiments on specific environments or benchmarks, I will note those as potential datasets. For instance, if the authors mention using standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning, I will identify those benchmarks as datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Atari 2600 benchmark**, I would look for the original source or citation for that benchmark in the references. Similarly, if any other datasets are mentioned, I will ensure to find their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
