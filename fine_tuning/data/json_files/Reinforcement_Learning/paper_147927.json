        "dcterms:description": "The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a platform that enables researchers to test their algorithms on over 50 Atari 2600 games. The agent sees the environment through image frames of the game, interacts with the environment with 18 possible actions, and receives feedback in the form of the change in the game score. The games were designed for humans and thus are free from experimenter bias. The games span many different genres that require the agent/algorithm to generalize over various tasks, difficulty levels, and timescales.",
