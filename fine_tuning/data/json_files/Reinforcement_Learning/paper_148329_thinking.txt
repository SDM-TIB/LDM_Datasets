To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contention Window Optimization in IEEE 802.11ax Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Witold Wydma≈Ñski and Szymon Szott, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give insights into the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors discuss their simulations and the parameters used, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe their own simulation framework (ns3-gym) and the settings used for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets relevant to their study. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of other research papers and articles discussing various aspects of IEEE 802.11 networks and machine learning applications, rather than specific datasets.

Given that the authors mention that they provide the complete source code for their method, I will also note that this code could potentially include synthetic datasets generated during their simulations, but these are not traditional datasets that would be cited in the same manner as publicly available datasets.

In conclusion, since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. Instead, I will summarize the experimental setup and the simulation framework used, which is ns3-gym, and note that the authors have made their source code available for further exploration.

Thus, my final output will reflect the absence of traditional datasets while acknowledging the simulation framework used in the study.
