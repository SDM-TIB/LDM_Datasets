To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MERLIN - Malware Evasion with Reinforcement LearnINg" by Tony Quertier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Background and related work)**, where the authors discuss notable datasets that have been made publicly available. Here, they mention three datasets: **EMBER**, **SOREL-20M**, and **BODMAS**. I will take note of these datasets and their relevance to the research.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors specify that they rely on the **BODMAS dataset** for malware selection, which contains 57,293 malware samples collected from August 2019 to September 2020. This section confirms the dataset's usage in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **EMBER dataset**, the citation is:
   > H. S. Anderson and P. Roth. *EMBER: An Open Dataset for Training Static PE Malware Machine Learning Models*. ArXiv e-prints, April 2018.

2. For the **SOREL-20M dataset**, the citation is:
   > Richard Harang and Ethan M. Rudd. *SOREL-20M: A Large Scale Benchmark Dataset for Malicious PE Detection*. 2020.

3. For the **BODMAS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Limin Yang, Arridhana Ciptadi, Ihar Laziuk, Ali Ahmadzadeh, and Gang Wang. *Bodmas: An open dataset for learning based temporal analysis of pe malware*. In 4th Deep Learning and Security Workshop, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
