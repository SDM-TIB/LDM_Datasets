To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Generating Diverse Design Solutions" by Kevin Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions generating a total of **4,000 design solutions** across various design topics, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify the specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Crowdsourcing Design Solutions from AmazonTurk Workers)**, where the authors describe how they retrieved human crowdsourced design solutions. They mention that they sourced **100 design solutions for each of five distinct design problems** from Amazon Mechanical Turk. This indicates that the dataset consists of human-generated design solutions.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the datasets in the **tables and figures**. In **Table 1**, the authors list the design problems for which they crowdsourced solutions, which helps contextualize the dataset. The design problems are:

1. A lightweight exercise device that can be used while traveling.
2. A device that disperses a light coating of powdered substance over a surface.
3. A new way to measure the passage of time.
4. An innovative product to froth milk.
5. A device to fold washcloths, hand towels, and small bath towels.

In addition to the crowdsourced dataset, I will check for any mention of datasets used for generating solutions with the LLM (GPT-4). The authors state that they generated **4,000 design solutions** using various combinations of parameters and prompt engineering techniques. However, they do not specify a separate dataset for these generated solutions, as they are derived from the LLM itself.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the crowdsourced design solutions, the citation is:
  > Goucher-Lambert, K., Cagan, J., et al. (2019). "Crowdsourcing inspiration: Using crowd generated inspirational stimuli to support designer ideation." *Design Studies*, 61, pp. 1â€“29.

- The paper also references the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk for crowdsourcing, which is a widely recognized platform but does not have a specific citation in this context.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
