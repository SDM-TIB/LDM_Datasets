To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Use of Experience in First Person Shooter Environments" by Matthew Aitchison, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of the **ViZDoom environment**, which suggests that this may be a dataset or a platform used for experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if the paper provides specific details about the datasets used. In section 3.1, the author mentions the **‘Health Gathering Supreme’ scenario in the ViZDoom environment** as the setting for the experiments. This indicates that the ViZDoom environment is indeed a key component of the dataset used for the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the ViZDoom environment. The paper cites the original ViZDoom paper, which provides the authoritative source for this dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ViZDoom**:
  > M. Kempka, M. Wydmuch, G. Runc, J. Toczek, and W. Jaskowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), pages 1–8, 2016. DOI: 10.1109/CIG.2016.7860433. [Online]. Available: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7860433/.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the experiments conducted within the ViZDoom environment and does not mention any additional datasets, I will conclude that the **ViZDoom environment** is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the ViZDoom environment, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
