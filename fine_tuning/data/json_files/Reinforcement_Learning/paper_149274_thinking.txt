To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic-Based Self-Critical Training for Question Generation" by Loïc Kwate Dassi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the potential applications of the research, including the enhancement of question answering datasets, which suggests that a specific dataset may be used or referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the author states that the training and inference were conducted with the benchmark reading comprehension dataset **SQUAD v1.1**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the experiments.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **related work section**. Here, the author references a large semi-structured knowledge database called **Probably Asked Questions (PAQ)**, which consists of about 65 million pairs. This dataset is relevant to the context of question generation and should be noted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **SQUAD v1.1**: The citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 238–244, 2016.

2. **Probably Asked Questions (PAQ)**: The citation is:
   > Patrick Lewis, Yuxiang Wu, Linqing Liu, Pasquale Minervini, Heinrich Küttler, Aleksandra Piktus, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *PAQ: 65 Million Probably-Asked Questions and What You Can Do with Them*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2021.

After compiling the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information before structuring it into the required format for further processing. This will include confirming the context in which each dataset is used and its significance to the research presented in the paper.
