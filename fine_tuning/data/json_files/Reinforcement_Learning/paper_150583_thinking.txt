To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilience in Platoons of Cooperative Heterogeneous Vehicles: Self-organization Strategies and Provably-correct Design" by Di Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used, including details about their size, structure, and purpose. If such a section exists, it will be crucial for gathering accurate information.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used in the **numerical experiments** or **validation** sections. The authors may describe how they implemented their methods using specific datasets, which is essential for understanding the context of their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is important because I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "CommonRoad" or "CARLA," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
