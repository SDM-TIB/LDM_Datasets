To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably More Efficient Q-Learning in the One-Sided-Feedback/Full-Feedback Settings" by Xiao-Yue Gong and David Simchi-Levi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to contain detailed information about datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Methods," or "Data"** sections. These sections typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize experimental results, as they often reference the datasets used. For instance, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will note the name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
