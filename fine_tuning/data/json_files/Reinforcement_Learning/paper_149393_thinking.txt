To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Independent Study of Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Driving" by Hanzhi Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **OpenAI Gym environment** for the Taxi task and the **highway-gym environment** for autonomous driving. This indicates that there are specific datasets or environments being utilized.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments, the author describes using the **Taxi-v3** environment from OpenAI Gym and the **CartPole-v1** environment, which are both standard environments used in reinforcement learning. Additionally, the **highway-env** environment is mentioned for the autonomous driving experiments.

I will then check the **appendices** for any additional details or code snippets that might reference datasets or environments. The appendices contain Python code that confirms the use of the **Taxi-v3** and **CartPole-v1** environments, as well as the **highway-env** environment.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each of these datasets/environments from the references section:

1. **Taxi-v3**:
   - Citation: 
     > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

2. **CartPole-v1**:
   - Citation: 
     > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

3. **Highway-env**:
   - Citation: 
     > Edouard Leurent. *An Environment for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making*. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Taxi-v3**: A toy text environment in OpenAI Gym where an agent learns to navigate a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers.
- **CartPole-v1**: A classic control environment in OpenAI Gym where an agent learns to balance a pole on a cart.
- **Highway-env**: An autonomous driving simulation environment where an ego-vehicle learns to navigate a multilane highway while avoiding collisions.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the full citations for each dataset clearly, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
