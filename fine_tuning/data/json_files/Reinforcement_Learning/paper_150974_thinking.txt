To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIAS RUNS DEEP: IMPLICIT REASONING BIASES IN PERSONA-ASSIGNED LLMS" by Shashank Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study covers **24 reasoning datasets**, which is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved. I will note this number and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology & Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they selected **22 datasets from the MMLU benchmark** and also include the **Sports Understanding dataset** and the **MBPP dataset**. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets directly.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the **Appendix A**, where they provide a summary of the datasets and their respective sizes. This will help me understand the context and purpose of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **MMLU Benchmark Datasets**: This includes 22 datasets spanning various categories such as mathematics, law, medicine, and more. The specific datasets will be listed in the appendix.
   
2. **Sports Understanding Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation suite for multi-hop reasoning.

3. **MBPP Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate programmatic reasoning.

For the citations, I will look for the original papers or sources for the MMLU benchmark, Sports Understanding dataset, and MBPP dataset. Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the citations as follows:

- For the **MMLU benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Xiaodong Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. ArXiv, abs/2009.03300, 2020.

- For the **Sports Understanding dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mirac Suzgun, Nathan Scales, Nathanael Scharli, Sebastian Gehrmann, Yi Tay, Hyung Won Chung, Aakanksha Chowdhery, Quoc V. Le, Ed Huai hsin Chi, Denny Zhou, and Jason Wei. *Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them*. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022.

- For the **MBPP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jacob Austin, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Maarten Bosma, Henryk Michalewski, David Dohan, Ellen Jiang, Carrie J. Cai, Michael Terry, Quoc V. Le, and Charles Sutton. *Program synthesis with large language models*. ArXiv, abs/2108.07732, 2021.

Finally, I will compile all this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
