To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional Sequence Modelling in Offline RL" by Taku Yamagata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of offline reinforcement learning and the Decision Transformer (DT), which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments. They mention using various environments, including "Maze2D" and "Open AI Gym MuJoCo," which indicates that these may be datasets or environments relevant to their research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Maze2D Datasets**: The authors refer to several Maze2D environments, including "maze2d-open-v0," "maze2d-umaze-v1," "maze2d-medium-v1," and "maze2d-large-v1." These datasets are designed to test the stitching ability of offline RL algorithms.

2. **Open AI Gym MuJoCo Datasets**: The authors also mention datasets such as "hopper-medium-v2," "halfcheetah-medium-v2," and "walker2d-medium-v2." These datasets are used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method in complex control tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided for datasets, but I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

For the Maze2D datasets, the citation is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

For the Open AI Gym MuJoCo datasets, the citation is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
