To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptation and Generalization for Unknown Sensitive Factors of Variations" by William Paul, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the research. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for statements that indicate the use of specific datasets, particularly in the context of experiments or evaluations. The authors may describe the datasets they used to validate their methods, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant factors that may influence the results. The authors mention two datasets: 

1. **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**: This dataset contains 43 different classes of traffic signs, with a total of 45,322 images for training and validation, and 10,112 images for testing. The authors also describe the factors affecting the dataset, such as sign size and lighting conditions.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset consists of facial images of celebrities, with various attributes labeled, including gender and attractiveness. The authors specify that there are 162,121 images for training and 39,201 images for testing, and they discuss the ground truth factors related to skin color and brightness.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pages 1453â€“1460, 2011.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
