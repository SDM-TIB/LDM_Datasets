To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lane Change Decision-making through Deep Reinforcement Learning with Rule-based Constraints" by Junjie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their simulation environment and the data used for training their model. In this section, they mention using a specific simulator for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset context.

I will also look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **results section**, where the authors may discuss the performance of their model based on the data collected during simulations. This could include metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

In this paper, the authors utilize a traffic simulator developed by Udacity for their experiments. The citation for this simulator is:
> Udacity. *CarND-Path-Planning-Project*. Available at: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project.

Additionally, they reference various studies and datasets related to reinforcement learning and autonomous driving, which may also be relevant. I will ensure to extract these citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and presented clearly for future use or analysis.
