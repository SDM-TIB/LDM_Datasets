To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Approach for Tactical Decision Making in Lane Changing: Sample Efficient Deep Q Learning with a Safety Feedback Reward" by Ugur Yavas, Tufan Kumbasar, and Nazm Kemal Ure, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the challenges of automated lane changing and refer to various approaches, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss the simulation environment or experimental setup. This is where the authors are likely to describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. If they mention any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will take note of their names and any relevant details.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors provide any additional context or validation regarding the datasets used. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that reinforce the importance of the datasets in their study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will look for their original papers to obtain the correct citations. If they have created their own datasets, I will note the details provided in the paper and cite the paper itself as the source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
