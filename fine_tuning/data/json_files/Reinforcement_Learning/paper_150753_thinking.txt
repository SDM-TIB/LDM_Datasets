To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning (RL) Augmented Cold Start Frequency Reduction in Serverless Computing" by Siddharth Agarwal, Maria A. Rodriguez, and Rajkumar Buyya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed solution using a "normalized real-world function demand trace with matrix multiplication as the workload." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **methodology** sections. In this case, the paper mentions using a "single function demand trace from the provided data" in the **performance evaluation** section. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized for the experiments.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites a source for the function demand trace as follows:

- For the dataset used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > M. Shahrad, R. Fonseca, I. Goiri, G. Chaudhry, P. Batum, J. Cooke, E. Laureano, C. Tresness, M. Russinovich, and R. Bianchini. *Serverless in the wild: Characterizing and optimizing the serverless workload at a large cloud provider*. In Proceedings of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 20), pages 205–218, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Normalized real-world function demand trace
   - **Description**: This dataset is used to evaluate the proposed RL-based solution for reducing cold start frequency in serverless computing. It involves workload patterns based on matrix multiplication tasks.
   - **Full Citation**: M. Shahrad, R. Fonseca, I. Goiri, G. Chaudhry, P. Batum, J. Cooke, E. Laureano, C. Tresness, M. Russinovich, and R. Bianchini. *Serverless in the wild: Characterizing and optimizing the serverless workload at a large cloud provider*. In Proceedings of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 20), pages 205–218, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
