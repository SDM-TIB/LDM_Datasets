To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations for Consequential Decisions" by Amir-Hossein Karimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of predictive models in consequential decision-making and mention the need for explanations based on real-world data. This suggests that datasets are likely to be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for their experiments: 

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 45,222 samples and 12 features, including various types of variables such as integer, real, categorical, and ordinal.

2. **Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 29,623 samples and 14 features, also including a mix of integer, real, categorical, and ordinal variables.

3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,278 samples and 5 features, with categorical and ordinal variables.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Adult data (1996). Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.

- For the **Credit Dataset**:
  > Yeh, I.-C., & Lien, C.-h. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 36(2), 2473-2480.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Larson, J., Kirchner, L., & Angwin, J. S. (2016). COMPAS analysis. Retrieved from https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
