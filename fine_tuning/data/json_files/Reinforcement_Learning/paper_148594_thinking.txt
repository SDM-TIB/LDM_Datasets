To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Momentum Q-learning with Finite-Sample Convergence Guarantee" by Bowen Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention if any datasets were used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

In the paper, the authors mention using the **FrozenLake** environment as a benchmark for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and any variations used in the experiments.

The citation for the FrozenLake dataset is typically attributed to the original source, which is:
> Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press, 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of their experiments or comparisons with other algorithms. If the authors refer to any other datasets, I will ensure to document those as well, along with their citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.
