To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RadDQN: a Deep Q Learning-based Architecture for Finding Time-efficient Minimum Radiation Exposure Pathway" by Biswajit Sadhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or simulations. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

In this paper, the authors describe a simulated environment using a **2D Grid-World** to represent a contaminated zone with radioactive sources. This indicates that the dataset is not a traditional dataset but rather a simulated environment created for the purpose of the study. I will note this as a dataset for the purposes of documentation.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or data sources used for validation or comparison. If they refer to any external datasets or benchmarks, I will document those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each.

In this case, the primary dataset is the simulated environment, which does not have a traditional citation. However, if any external datasets were referenced, I would include their citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and any relevant citations.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify the simulated environment as the primary dataset.
3. Check for any external datasets or benchmarks and retrieve their citations.
4. Document the findings in a clear and structured manner.
