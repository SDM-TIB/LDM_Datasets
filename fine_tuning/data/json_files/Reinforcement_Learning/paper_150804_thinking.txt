To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferability Analysis of Data-Driven Additive Manufacturing Knowledge: A Case Study Between Powder Bed Fusion and Directed Energy Deposition" by Mutahar Safdar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a case study involving two additive manufacturing processes, which suggests that datasets related to these processes may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They refer to the **LPBF dataset** from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the **DED dataset** from Mississippi State University (MSU). I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

In the case study, the authors provide specific details about the LPBF dataset, including the experimental setup, parameters, and the type of data collected (melt pool images). They also mention that the DED dataset consists of melt pool images captured during the DED process. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **LPBF dataset**:
   > Lane, Brandon, and Yeung, Ho. "Process monitoring dataset from the additive manufacturing metrology testbed (AMMT): Overhang part x4." *Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology* Vol. 125 (2020): pp. 1-18.

2. For the **DED dataset**:
   > Marshall, Garrett J, Thompson, Scott M, and Shamsaei, Nima. "Data indicating temperature response of Ti–6Al–4V thin-walled structure during its additive manufacture via Laser Engineered Net Shaping." *Data in Brief* Vol. 7 (2016): pp. 697-703.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
