To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Impact of Multi-LiDAR Placement on Object Detection for Autonomous Driving" by Hanjiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a new data collection framework, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of LiDAR data for 3D object detection and mention that they use a realistic simulator (CARLA) for data collection. This indicates that the dataset may be generated from simulations rather than traditional datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention collecting point cloud data in the CARLA simulator, which is a significant clue that the dataset is derived from this simulation environment. They specify that the collected dataset contains about 45,000 point cloud frames with 3D bounding boxes for various vehicle types, including Cars, Vans, and Cyclists.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset, such as how the data was collected and any specific configurations used during the experiments. The appendix mentions that the data was collected in four different towns within the CARLA simulator, which provides context for the dataset's diversity.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset consists of point cloud frames collected from the CARLA simulator, specifically designed for evaluating LiDAR configurations in 3D object detection tasks. The dataset includes approximately 45,000 frames with annotated 3D bounding boxes for normal-size vehicles (Cars) and abnormal-size vehicles (Vans and Cyclists).

Next, I will locate the full citation for the CARLA simulator, which is referenced in the paper. The citation is:

- For the CARLA simulator:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16. PMLR, 2017.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for inclusion in the structured output format as required.
