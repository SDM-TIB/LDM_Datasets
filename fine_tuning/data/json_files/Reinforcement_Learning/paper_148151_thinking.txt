To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ctrl-Z: Recovering from Instability in Reinforcement Learning" by Vibhavari Dasagi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on a standard suite of benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section IV)**, where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. They mention a "standard benchmark suite of six OpenAI Gym Mujoco environments for continuous control of simulated robots." This indicates that the datasets are related to these environments.

The specific environments mentioned are:
1. **HalfCheetah-v1**
2. **Ant-v1**
3. **Reacher-v1**
4. **Hopper-v1**
5. **Walker2d-v1**
6. **Humanoid-v1**

I will confirm that these environments are indeed datasets used for the experiments by checking the context in which they are mentioned. The authors state that the desired behavior in these environments is to maximize forward velocity, except for Reacher-v1, which is a target reaching task. This confirms that these environments serve as datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The environments are part of the OpenAI Gym and Mujoco, so I will need to cite the relevant papers that describe these environments.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *ArXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In *2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems* (pp. 5026â€“5033). IEEE.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
