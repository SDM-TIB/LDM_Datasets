To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of a practical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm in PyBioNetFit" by J. Neumann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the implementation of a new MCMC method and mentions its application to real-world problems, including forecasting COVID-19 cases. This suggests that there may be datasets related to COVID-19.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. The introduction discusses Bayesian inference and mentions using an adaptive MCMC method for forecasting COVID-19 cases, which indicates that there are datasets involved in this analysis.

I will then look into the **methods** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that describe the datasets used for the experiments. The authors mention that inference job setup files for test problems are included in the latest PyBNF distribution and that these files are provided as supplementary files. This is a good indication that specific datasets are detailed in the supplementary materials.

In the **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe several test problems, including:

1. **Test Problem 1**: Involves synthetic data generated for a linear regression problem, with the dataset provided in Supplementary File S1.
2. **Test Problem 2**: Analyzes patient data from Ho et al. (1995) using a two-phase exponential decay model for HIV dynamics, with datasets for Patients 303, 403, and 409 provided in Supplementary File S2.
3. **Test Problem 4**: Involves regional COVID-19 surveillance data, with datasets for various metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) provided in Supplementary File S4.

Next, I will consult the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the patient data from Ho et al. (1995):
  > Ho, D.D., et al. (1995). Rapid turnover of plasma virions and CD4 lymphocytes in HIV-1 infection. *Nature*, 373, 123–126.

- For the COVID-19 forecasting data:
  > Lin, Y.T., et al. (2021). Daily forecasting of regional epidemics of Coronavirus Disease with Bayesian uncertainty quantification, United States. *Emerging Infectious Diseases*, 27, 767–778.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
