To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Successor Uncertainties: Exploration and Uncertainty in Temporal Difference Learning" by David Janz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on the **Atari 2600 domain**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this domain.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 games** as a benchmark for their experiments. They state that their algorithm was tested on a standard set of 49 games from the Arcade Learning Environment. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset. The Atari 2600 dataset is commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The citation for the Atari 2600 dataset is:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

Next, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

1. **Atari 2600 Dataset**: This dataset consists of a collection of 49 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The dataset allows for benchmarking various algorithms in a standardized environment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
