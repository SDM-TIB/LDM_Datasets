To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Causal Queries at Layer 3 with DiscoSCMs: Embracing Heterogeneity" by Heyang Gong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the author discusses the relevance of causal inference and may mention datasets used for empirical validation. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or studies that utilize datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology or experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check there as well, as authors often reiterate the datasets used when discussing their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "LBCF" dataset, I will look for its full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Meng Ai, Biao Li, Heyang Gong, et al. "LBCF: A Large-Scale Budget-Constrained Causal Forest Algorithm." In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022, 2310â€“2319.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to double-check the accuracy of the citations and the details provided for each dataset.
