To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Fairness for Predictions Using Generative Adversarial Networks" by Yuchen Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on counterfactual fairness, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using two real-world datasets: 

1. **UCI Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether individuals earn more than $50,000 per year, with gender as the sensitive attribute. 

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict recidivism risk, with race as the sensitive attribute.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCI Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). UCI machine learning repository. 

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals and it’s biased against blacks. ProPublica.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
