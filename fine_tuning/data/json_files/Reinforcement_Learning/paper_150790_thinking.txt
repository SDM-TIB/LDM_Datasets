To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fitness Approximation through Machine Learning" by Itai Tzruia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes fitness approximation in genetic algorithms, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the use of genetic algorithms and mentions various applications, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors describe the problems being solved: **Blackjack, Frozen Lake, and Monster Cliff Walking**. Each of these problems is implemented using the Gymnasium framework, which suggests that the datasets used for fitness evaluation are derived from these environments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention that they maintain a dataset of sampled individuals along with their actual fitness scores. However, they do not provide specific names for datasets outside of the environments used. The datasets are essentially the data generated during the experiments on the Gymnasium environments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **references section** for any papers that describe the Gymnasium environments or the specific implementations of the games mentioned. The Gymnasium framework itself is cited as follows:

- For **Gymnasium**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Next, I will summarize the datasets based on the environments used in the experiments:

1. **Blackjack**: The dataset consists of the states and actions taken by the agent in the Blackjack environment, where fitness is evaluated based on the number of wins in simulated games.

2. **Frozen Lake**: Similar to Blackjack, the dataset includes the states of the agent navigating the Frozen Lake environment, with fitness evaluated based on the percentage of wins in simulated games.

3. **Monster Cliff Walking**: This dataset includes the states of the agent in the Monster Cliff Walking environment, where fitness is evaluated based on the average score across episodes.

Since the datasets are generated from the Gymnasium environments and do not have separate published citations, I will reference the Gymnasium framework as the source of these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.
