To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistent Counterfactuals for Deep Models" by Emily Black et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on counterfactual examples and mentions that the authors illustrate their approach on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they empirically demonstrate their method on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will find a subsection that details the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of individuals' financial data with a binary response indicating creditworthiness. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dua, D., & Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

2. **Taiwanese Credit Dataset**: Similar to the German Credit dataset, this dataset contains financial data with a binary response. The citation is the same as for the German Credit dataset:
   > Dua, D., & Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

3. **Seizure Dataset**: This dataset comprises time-series EEG recordings for individuals, with a binary response indicating the occurrence of a seizure. The citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seizure

4. **Cardiotocography (CTG) Dataset**: This dataset includes fetal cardiotocograms labeled by expert obstetricians. The citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography

5. **Warfarin Dosing Dataset**: This dataset contains information about patients prescribed warfarin. The citation is:
   > International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium. (2009). *Estimation of the warfarin dose with clinical and pharmacogenetic data*. New England Journal of Medicine, 360(8), 753-764.

6. **FICO HELOC Dataset**: This dataset contains anonymized information about Home Equity Line of Credit applications. The citation is:
   > FICO. (2018). *FICO XML Challenge*. Retrieved from https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details and citations for each dataset. This will allow me to compile the information in a structured format for further use or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly attributed.
