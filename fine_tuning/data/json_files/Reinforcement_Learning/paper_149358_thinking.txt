To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in the Presence of Uncertainty Using Reinforcement Learning" by Kasra Rezaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a traffic simulator, specifically the **SUMO traffic simulator**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to traffic scenarios used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe the scenarios tested. They mention two specific scenarios: one involving **pedestrians crossing with occlusion** and another involving **curved roads with limited visibility**. I will check if these scenarios are associated with specific datasets or if they are generated using the SUMO simulator.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they trained and tested their algorithms using scenarios developed with the **SUMO traffic simulation software**. This indicates that the datasets used for training and evaluation are likely generated from this simulator rather than being pre-existing datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SUMO simulator, as it is the primary source of the datasets used in the experiments. The relevant citation for SUMO is:

- **SUMO Traffic Simulator**:
  > P. A. Lopez, M. Behrisch, L. Bieker-Walz, J. Erdmann, Y.-P. Flötteröd, R. Hilbrich, L. Lücken, J. Rummel, P. Wagner, and E. Wießner. "Microscopic traffic simulation using SUMO." In The 21st IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the scenarios generated using SUMO, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the one generated from the SUMO simulator.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SUMO simulator as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any further analysis or use of the dataset.
