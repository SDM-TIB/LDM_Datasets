To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directed Exploration in PAC Model-Free Reinforcement Learning" by Min-hwan Oh and Garud Iyengar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of exploration in reinforcement learning but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be described.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors detail their experimental setup and results. They mention conducting experiments on **chain MDPs** with varying lengths (N = 10 and N = 50). However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or benchmarks, as the experiments are based on simulated environments rather than real-world datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and previous works on reinforcement learning, and do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly or provide citations for datasets used in experiments, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Directed Exploration in PAC Model-Free Reinforcement Learning" by Min-hwan Oh and Garud Iyengar, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
