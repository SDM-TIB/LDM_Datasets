To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Advantage Networks for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Dec-POMDPs" by Raphaël Avalos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** benchmark, which is a well-known dataset for evaluating multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, the number of maps, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide additional information about the SMAC benchmark, including a table listing the different maps and their configurations. This is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and how it was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the necessary information about the dataset:

1. **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This dataset consists of various maps designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. The paper mentions that it includes 14 different maps, each with specific configurations of agents and enemies.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SMAC benchmark. The relevant citation is:

- For **StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, the citation is:

Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS, 4:2186–2188, 2 2019. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04043v5.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for reference.
