To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Driving from Natural Language Instructions" by Junha Roh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions training a policy with "conditional imitation learning from realistic language data collected from human drivers and navigators," which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **Training and Environment section**, the authors mention using **CARLA**, an open-source driving simulator, to generate data for training. This indicates that CARLA is a significant dataset or framework used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets. The authors reference CARLA multiple times, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin and details.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: The paper describes using the CARLA simulator to generate realistic driving scenarios and language instructions. This dataset is essential for training the model and evaluating its performance.

I will now look for the full citation of the CARLA dataset in the references. The relevant citation is:
> A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

With this information, I have identified the primary dataset used in the research paper and its citation. I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for datasets.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: CARLA
- **Description**: An open-source driving simulator used to generate realistic driving scenarios and language instructions for training and evaluating the model.
- **Full Citation**: A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
