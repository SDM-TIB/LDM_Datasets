To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEMON: Explainable Entity Matching" by Nils Barlaug, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more faithful to the matcher," indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of records, types of data).

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention using **13 public datasets** for their experiments. They categorize these datasets into structured, dirty, and textual types, which is useful for understanding the context in which the datasets are used.

I will then compile the specific datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Amazon-Google Dataset**: A structured dataset used for entity matching.
2. **Beer Dataset**: Another structured dataset utilized in the experiments.
3. **DBLP-ACM Dataset**: A structured dataset that is part of the evaluation.
4. **DBLP-GoogleScholar Dataset**: A structured dataset used for comparison.
5. **Fodors-Zagats Dataset**: A structured dataset included in the experiments.
6. **iTunes-Amazon Dataset**: A dirty dataset created from its structured counterpart.
7. **Walmart-Amazon Dataset**: Another dirty dataset used in the evaluation.
8. **Abt-Buy Dataset**: A textual dataset included in the experiments.
9. **Company Dataset**: Another textual dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, but I will look for any references that discuss these datasets in detail.

For example, the citation for the **Amazon-Google Dataset** might be found in a previous work that introduced it, and I will note that down. Similarly, I will look for citations for the other datasets mentioned.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, which may look something like this:

- **Amazon-Google Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **Beer Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **DBLP-ACM Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **DBLP-GoogleScholar Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **Fodors-Zagats Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **iTunes-Amazon Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **Walmart-Amazon Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **Abt-Buy Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

- **Company Dataset**: 
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

Finally, I will compile all this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
