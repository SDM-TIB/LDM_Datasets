To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post Hoc Explanations of Language Models Can Improve Language Models" by Satyapriya Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used to evaluate their framework, AMPLIFY. In this section, the authors mention several datasets from the Big-Bench-Hard benchmark, which is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved.

I will list the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **The Snarks Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate a model's ability to discern sarcastic sentences from alternatives.
2. **The Causal Judgment Dataset**: This dataset assesses a model's ability to deduce causative factors from detailed summaries.
3. **The Ruin Names Dataset**: This dataset involves identifying comical modifications to artist or movie names.
4. **The Formal Fallacies Dataset**: This dataset tests models on distinguishing logically sound arguments from those with logical discrepancies.
5. **The Salient Translation Error Detection Dataset**: This dataset is designed to train models in identifying specific translation errors.
6. **The CommonsenseQA Dataset**: This is a multiple-choice question-answering dataset that requires commonsense knowledge.
7. **The Coin Flip Dataset**: This is a synthetically generated dataset used to assess symbolic reasoning capabilities.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will include are:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details as presented in the paper.
