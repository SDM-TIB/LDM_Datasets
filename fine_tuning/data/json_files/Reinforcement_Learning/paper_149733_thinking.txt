To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Autonomous Driving with Semantic Depth Cloud Mapping and Multi-agent" by Oskar Natan and Jun Miura, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that the dataset used for training and validation might be generated from this simulator.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **Section IV (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe the data generation process. Here, they state that they use the **CARLA simulator** to generate datasets for training and validation. They provide details about the maps and weather presets used, which indicates that the dataset is not a single entity but rather a collection of data generated under various conditions.

In **Table I**, the authors outline the dataset generation settings, including the different **towns** (Town01 to Town10) and the types of **route sets** (long, short, tiny) used in the experiments. This table is crucial as it summarizes the dataset's structure and the conditions under which it was generated.

The authors also mention that the dataset consists of **RGB images, depth maps, semantic segmentation ground truth, expert trajectories, speed measurements, and vehicular controls**. This comprehensive description indicates that the dataset is rich and multi-modal, which is essential for the tasks they are addressing.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the CARLA simulator, which is the primary source of the dataset:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), Mountain View, USA, Nov. 2017, pp. 1â€“16.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: Generated from the CARLA simulator, consisting of RGB images, depth maps, semantic segmentation ground truth, expert trajectories, speed measurements, and vehicular controls across various towns and weather conditions.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that I have included all necessary citations and descriptions.
