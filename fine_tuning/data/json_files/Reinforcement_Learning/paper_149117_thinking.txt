To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smooth Q-learning: Accelerate Convergence of Q-learning Using Similarity" by Wei Liaoa, Xiaohui Wei, and Jizhou Laic, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical examples sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the introduction and numerical examples.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the general application of Q-learning but do not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to the **numerical examples section** (Section 4), where the authors describe two specific examples: the **Pendulum problem** and the **MountainCar problem**. These examples are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning, but I need to confirm if they refer to any specific datasets or if they are standard problems.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors mention the **Pendulum problem** and provide details about its dynamics and reward function. This problem is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning, but it does not have a formal dataset citation since it is typically implemented in simulation environments like OpenAI Gym.

Similarly, in **Section 4.2**, the **MountainCar problem** is described, which is also a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. Like the Pendulum problem, it is commonly found in simulation environments and does not have a specific dataset citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that refer to datasets or benchmarks related to these problems. However, since both the Pendulum and MountainCar problems are standard benchmarks, they do not have formal citations in the same way that datasets do. Instead, they are often referenced in the context of reinforcement learning literature.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Pendulum Problem**: A standard benchmark in reinforcement learning, typically implemented in simulation environments like OpenAI Gym. No formal dataset citation is provided.
2. **MountainCar Problem**: Another standard benchmark in reinforcement learning, also commonly implemented in simulation environments. No formal dataset citation is provided.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses two well-known problems in reinforcement learning, it does not provide specific datasets with formal citations. I will note that these problems are widely recognized in the field and can be found in resources like OpenAI Gym for practical implementation.
