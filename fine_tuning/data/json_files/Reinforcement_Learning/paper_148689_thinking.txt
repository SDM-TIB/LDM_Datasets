To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LM-Reloc: Levenberg-Marquardt Based Direct Visual Relocalization" by Lukas von Stumberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on the **CARLA** and **Oxford RobotCar** relocalization tracking benchmarks, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluate their method on the **CARLA** dataset and the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

1. For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: an open urban driving simulator. In CoRL.

2. For the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**, the citation is:
   > Maddern, W., Pascoe, G., Linegar, C., & Newman, P. (2017). 1 Year, 1000km: The Oxford RobotCar Dataset. IJRR, 36(1), 1-20.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
