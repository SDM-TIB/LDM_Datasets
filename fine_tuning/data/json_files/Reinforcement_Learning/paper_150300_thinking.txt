To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransfQMix: Transformers for Leveraging the Graph Structure of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Problems" by Matteo Gallici et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the environments and datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets or environments that are utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two environments where they tested their method: 

1. **Spread Environment**: This environment is described as a cooperative multi-agent task where agents must move to random positions occupied by landmarks while avoiding collisions. The paper indicates that the observation space and reward structure are defined for this environment.

2. **StarCraft II Learning Environment**: The authors mention using various micromanagement tasks from the StarCraft II game, which is a well-known benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The Spread environment is referenced as part of the PettingZoo library, which is a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The StarCraft II Learning Environment is cited as a new challenge for reinforcement learning.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Spread Environment**:
  > PettingZoo: Gym for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021), 15032–15043.

- For the **StarCraft II Learning Environment**:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Timo Ewalds, Sergey Bartunov, Petko Georgiev, Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, Michelle Yeo, Alireza Makhzani, Heinrich Küttler, John Agapiou, Julian Schrittwieser, et al. 2017. Starcraft II: A new challenge for reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782 (2017).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
