To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variance Reduction for Policy-Gradient Methods via Empirical Variance Minimization" by Maxim Kaledin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are referenced.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections in detail. These sections typically contain descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for specific details about how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. Each dataset entry will include:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size or structure.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper. This will facilitate understanding and further research by others in the field.
