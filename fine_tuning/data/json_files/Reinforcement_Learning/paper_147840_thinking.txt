To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Relevance Graphs" by Aleksandra Malysheva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of the MAGNet approach to the **Pommerman game**, which suggests that this game environment is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors describe the **Pommerman game environment** in detail, indicating that it is a widely used benchmark for evaluating multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. They mention that the game can be played by up to 4 players and describe its mechanics, which confirms its role as a dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Pommerman game. The authors reference it as follows:

- **Pommerman Game**: 
  > Matiisen, T. *Pommerman baselines*. https://github.com/tambetm/pommerman-baselines, 2018.

Since the Pommerman game is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information accordingly.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **Pommerman Game**: A multi-agent environment used for evaluating the proposed MAGNet approach. It allows for up to 4 players and features a grid-world where agents can interact with various objects.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
