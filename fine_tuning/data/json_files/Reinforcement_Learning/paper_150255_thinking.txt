To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Exploration in Resource-Restricted Reinforcement Learning" by Zhihai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) in resource-restricted environments and mentions experiments conducted in various tasks. This suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names or references.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section 7) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. They mention designing tasks based on Gym and Mujoco, which are widely used frameworks for RL research. I will look for specific datasets or environments that are explicitly named.

In the paper, the authors describe several environments:
1. **Electric Mountain Car**: A task where the agent aims to reach the mountain top with limited electricity.
2. **Delivery Mountain Car**: A task where the agent aims to deliver goods to the mountain top.
3. **Electric Ant**: A task involving a 2D robot with limited electricity.
4. **Delivery Ant**: A task involving a 2D robot that delivers goods.

These environments are based on existing frameworks, so I will check the references to see if they cite any specific datasets or foundational papers that describe these environments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references Gym and Mujoco, which are not datasets per se but rather platforms that provide various environments for RL research. However, I will note the relevant citations for these platforms:

- For **Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 5026â€“5033.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
