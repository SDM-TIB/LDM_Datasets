To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Affordance Learning for Driving in Urban Environments" by Axel Sauer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the use of the **CARLA simulation benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on any section that explicitly mentions datasets, such as a **Datasets** or **Experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their data collection process in **section 3.2 (Training)**, where they mention recording a dataset with the CARLA simulator.

In this section, they specify that the dataset contains approximately **240,000 images** along with corresponding ground truth labels for six affordances. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and specifically tailored for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CARLA**:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In *Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)*.

Since CARLA is an open-source simulator, it serves as both a dataset and a simulation environment for training and testing their models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CARLA dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included.
