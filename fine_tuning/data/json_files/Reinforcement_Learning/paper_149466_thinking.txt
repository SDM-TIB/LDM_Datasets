To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Where to Look: A Unified Attention Model for Visual Recognition with Reinforcement Learning" by Gang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on visual classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the author states that the model is evaluated on three datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **SVHN**. I will note these datasets and gather more details about each one.

In the **experiments section**, I will find the descriptions of how each dataset is used. For example, the MNIST dataset is described as containing handwritten images of digits, while CIFAR10 consists of images across 10 classes, and SVHN is related to street view house numbers. I will ensure to capture the specifics of each dataset, such as the number of images and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: 
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

3. **SVHN Dataset**: 
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011. [http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
