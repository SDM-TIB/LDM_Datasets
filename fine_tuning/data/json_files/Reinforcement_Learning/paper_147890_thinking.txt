To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELF OpenGo: An Analysis and Open Reimplementation of AlphaZero" by Yuandong Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors provide "selfplay datasets" and "auxiliary data," which indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look into the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss datasets in detail. I will pay special attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Validating model strength)** and **section B (Auxiliary dataset details)**.

In **section 4.1 (Prototype model)**, the authors mention evaluating their model against human players and other AIs, but they do not specify datasets here. However, in **section B (Auxiliary dataset details)**, they provide specific information about two datasets:

1. **Human games dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 professional games sampled from the Gogod database from 2011 to 2015. This dataset is crucial for validating the model's performance against human players.

2. **Ladder dataset**: This dataset contains 100 games featuring ladder scenarios collected from the online CGOS service. The authors mention that they augment this dataset eight-fold through rotations and reflections, which is important for understanding the model's handling of specific game scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Human games dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gogod database. *Gogod Online*. Available at: https://gogodonline.co.uk/

- For the **Ladder dataset**, the citation is:
  > CGOS (Computer Go Server). *CGOS Service*. Available at: http://www.yss-aya.com/cgos/19x19/standings.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
