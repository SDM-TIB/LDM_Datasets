To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Education via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning" by Hugh Zhang and David C. Parkes, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, the authors discuss the training and evaluation of their model on addition tasks. They mention that the model was trained on addition problems of varying digit lengths, but they do not refer to any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the generation of training data programmatically, which means there may not be traditional datasets to cite.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in prior work or as benchmarks. However, since the paper focuses on self-generated data for training, it is likely that there are no external datasets to cite.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year, as this is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
