To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Battery Management in Dairy Farming via Proximal Policy Optimization" by Nawazish Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research uses "real-world data," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three key datasets:

1. **Electricity Consumption Data**: This dataset contains hourly electricity consumption data over one year, with a total consumption of 261 MW. The authors reference this data as being collected from a specific source.

2. **PV Electricity Generation Data**: This dataset is sourced from the NREL Advisor Model and includes hourly generation data over one year with a capacity of 20 KW.

3. **Electric Price Data**: This dataset includes dynamic electricity prices collected from the Helsinki electricity supply company website, which features three different price levels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For the **Electricity Consumption Data**, the citation is:
  > S. Uski and E. Rinne. *Data for a dairy farm microgrid solution*. Zenodo, June 2018. Retrieved June 2022. [https://zenodo.org/record/1294967](https://zenodo.org/record/1294967).

- For the **PV Electricity Generation Data**, the citation is:
  > National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). *System advisor model (sam)*. 2017. Retrieved November 1, 2022. [https://sam.nrel.gov](https://sam.nrel.gov).

- For the **Electric Price Data**, the citation is:
  > Helen. *Electricity products and prices*. Retrieved November 15, 2023. [https://www.helen.fi/en/electricity/electricity-products-and-prices](https://www.helen.fi/en/electricity/electricity-products-and-prices).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
