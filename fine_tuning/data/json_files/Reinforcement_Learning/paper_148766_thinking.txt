To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consolidation via Policy Information Regularization in Deep RL for Multi-Agent Games" by Tyler Malloy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the methodologies and datasets used for their evaluations. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various multi-agent environments used for testing their proposed method. I will look for specific names of these environments, as they may correspond to datasets or benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using environments like "Cooperative Communication" or "Competitive Keep Away," I will ensure to find the original sources or papers that describe these environments in detail, as they may not be standalone datasets but rather specific setups or benchmarks used in the context of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or presentation.
