To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Importance of Prior Knowledge in Precise Multimodal Prediction" by Sergio Casas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their approach on "real-world self-driving datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets: **ATG4D** and **nuScenes**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their results on both datasets, indicating that they achieved significant improvements in precision and safety metrics. They also reference the datasets multiple times throughout the section, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **ATG4D dataset**, the citation is:
   > B. Yang, W. Luo, and R. Urtasun. "Pixor: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds." In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 2018.

2. For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
   > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. "nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now summarize the findings:

- **ATG4D**: A dataset used for motion forecasting in autonomous driving, which includes various driving scenarios and metrics for evaluation.
- **nuScenes**: A multimodal dataset that provides rich annotations for autonomous driving tasks, including perception and prediction.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
