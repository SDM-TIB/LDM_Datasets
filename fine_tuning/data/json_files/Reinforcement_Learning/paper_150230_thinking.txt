To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relative Sparsity for Medical Decision Problems" by Samuel J. Weisenthal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors illustrate their method with a "real, observational healthcare dataset." This indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their research, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **data** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology in detail in **section 2 (Data and framework)**. Here, they refer to a specific dataset: the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They describe how they utilize this dataset for their analysis of hypotension management in the ICU.

I will also check the **experiments** or **results** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the MIMIC-III dataset is discussed further. In the **real data analysis (section 7)**, the authors provide a detailed description of how they use the MIMIC-III dataset, including cohort selection and the specific covariates they analyze.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016. DOI: 10.1038/s41597-016-0006-8.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is a freely available, observational electronic health record dataset from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, used for analyzing hypotension management in the ICU.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
