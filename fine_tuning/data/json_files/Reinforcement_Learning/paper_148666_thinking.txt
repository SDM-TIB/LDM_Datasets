To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Learning in Deep Q-Networks" by Xing Wang and Alexander Vinel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed cross Q-learning algorithm and its evaluation on benchmark environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the overestimation problem in reinforcement learning and mentions empirical evidence from experiments, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets used for evaluation.

I will then look into the **experimental results** section, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **section 4.1 (CartPole)**, the authors describe the CartPole environment, which is a classic control problem. They mention that the experiments were conducted using the OpenAI Gym environment, which implies that the dataset is part of this framework. However, they do not provide a specific dataset citation, as the environment is widely recognized.

In **section 4.2 (Lunar Lander)**, the authors again refer to the Lunar Lander task within the OpenAI Gym. Similar to the previous section, this indicates that the dataset is part of the Gym framework, but no specific citation is provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the OpenAI Gym or specific datasets used in the experiments. The relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016. 

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets beyond the environments provided by OpenAI Gym, I will summarize my findings.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets identified, particularly the OpenAI Gym reference, which is crucial for proper attribution.
