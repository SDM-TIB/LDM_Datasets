To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Policy Gradient by Estimating Value Function from Prior Computation in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Md Masudur Rahman and Yexiang Xue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of prior computations to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, they mention conducting experiments on several reinforcement learning benchmarks, specifically:

1. **OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander**: This environment is used for testing the proposed methods in various generalization settings.
2. **Atari BeamRider**: Another environment used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.
3. **Atari Breakout**: This environment is also included in the experiments.
4. **DeepMind Control Suite Walker Stand and Run**: These tasks are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in continuous control tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance comparisons across these environments, but they do not provide specific dataset citations. However, I can infer that these environments are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these environments:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

- For **Atari environments**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

- For **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Saran Tunyasuvunakool, Alistair Muldal, Yotam Doron, Siqi Liu, Steven Bohez, Josh Merel, Tom Erez, Timothy Lillicrap, Nicolas Heess, and Yuval Tassa. *DM Control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6:100022, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
