To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Adaptive Proposal Model for Temporal Action Detection based on Reinforcement Learning" by Jingjia Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments validate the proposed method on the **THUMOS 2014 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly state that they validate their method on the **THUMOS 2014 dataset**, which contains over 20 hours of video from 20 sport action categories, comprising 413 videos.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the THUMOS 2014 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **THUMOS 2014 Dataset**:
  > Y.-G. Jiang, J. Liu, A. Roshan Zamir, G. Toderici, I. Laptev, M. Shah, and R. Sukthankar. *THUMOS challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. http://crcv.ucf.edu/THUMOS14/, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the THUMOS 2014 dataset and does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
