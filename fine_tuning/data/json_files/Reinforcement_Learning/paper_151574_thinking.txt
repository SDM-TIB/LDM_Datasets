To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Select Goals in Automated Planning with Deep-Q Learning" by Carlos Núñez-Molina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their architecture on a video game environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Background)** and **section 5 (Experiments and Analysis of Results)**. In section 2.1, the authors mention using the **General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework** and specifically reference the game **Boulder Dash** as the environment for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are likely derived from this game.

In section 4.2, the authors describe how they collected datasets from 200 training levels, which were used to train their model. They mention that the datasets were collected by an agent performing random exploration in the game, resulting in a total of **100,000 unique samples**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GVGAI framework and any other relevant works that may have contributed to the datasets used in this research. The GVGAI framework is cited as:
> Liebana, D. P., Samothrakis, S., Togelius, J., Schaul, T., Lucas, S. M., Couetoux, A., Lee, J., Lim, C., and Thompson, T. (2016). *The 2014 general video game playing competition*. IEEE Trans. Comput. Intell. AI Games, 8(3):229–243.

Additionally, I will note that the Boulder Dash game is a specific implementation within the GVGAI framework, but it may not have a separate citation since it is part of the framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **GVGAI Framework Dataset**: This dataset includes various levels from the GVGAI framework, specifically focusing on the Boulder Dash game, with a total of 100,000 unique samples collected from 200 training levels.

2. **Boulder Dash Game Dataset**: While this is part of the GVGAI framework, it is important to note that the experiments were conducted using this specific game, which serves as the testbed for the proposed architecture.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both the GVGAI framework and any other relevant works that may be referenced in the paper. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
