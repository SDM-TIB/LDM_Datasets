To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adverse Garage Scenario Generation" by Kai Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the need for simulation testing in autonomous vehicles, which suggests that datasets related to simulation environments may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author outlines the challenges in testing autonomous driving systems and mentions the use of 3D simulators like Carla. This indicates that datasets related to these simulators might be relevant.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets that are generated or utilized in the experiments. The author describes a procedural generation framework for creating underground garage scenarios, which implies that there may be datasets generated from this framework.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are used for validation or testing purposes. The author mentions generating encoding matrices and converting them into FBX and OpenDrive files, which are formats used for 3D models and road networks. This suggests that the generated scenarios could be considered datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the paper refers to existing datasets, I will ensure to include their citations as well.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
