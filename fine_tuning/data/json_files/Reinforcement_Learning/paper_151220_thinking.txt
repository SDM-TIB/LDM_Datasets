To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ORIENT: A Priority-Aware Energy-Efficient Approach for Latency-Sensitive Applications in 6G" by Masoud Shokrnezhad and Tarik Taleb, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of energy consumption in 6G systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for their numerical simulations or evaluations. In this case, the paper does not seem to provide specific datasets but rather discusses the simulation parameters and the methodology used to evaluate the proposed approach.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily focus on related works and do not specify datasets directly.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets used, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Since no datasets are identified in this paper, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets in this research.
