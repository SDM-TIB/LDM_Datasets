To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Source AoI-Constrained Resource Minimization under HARQ: Heterogeneous Sampling Processes" by Saeid Sadeghi Vilni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions of each dataset. This section often contains essential information such as the source of the dataset, the number of samples, and any relevant attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation. This will facilitate easy access and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and comprehensive, ready for presentation or further analysis.
