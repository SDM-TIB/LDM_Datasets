To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Renewable Energy in Agriculture: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach" by Abdul Wahid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) for optimizing photovoltaic (PV) system installations, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to identify if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section discusses various applications of DQNs but does not provide specific datasets used in those studies.

I will then focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. Here, the authors describe the training of the DQN model and the parameters used, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Instead, they refer to the variables influencing the decision-making process, such as farm load, government incentives, and installation budget.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the study. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical analyses and applications of DQNs rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on the development of a DQN framework and its application to PV system decision-making without referencing any external datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the application of DQNs in agriculture, it does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.
