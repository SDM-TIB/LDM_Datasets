To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasted Treatment Effects" by Irene Botosaru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the estimation and inference of treatment effects, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the evaluation of policies and the construction of counterfactuals, which may hint at the use of datasets, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methods and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically provide details on the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for empirical validation or simulations. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any details provided about their structure, size, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

If the paper includes any supplementary materials or appendices, I will review those as well, as they may contain additional information about datasets that were not included in the main text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to reflect the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
