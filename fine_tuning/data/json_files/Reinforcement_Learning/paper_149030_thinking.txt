To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Electricity Generation Investment for the Minimization of Long-Term Carbon Emissions and Electricity Costs" by Alexander J. M. Kell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the transition to low-carbon electricity and mention the use of the **FTT:Power model**. This indicates that the model itself may be a source of data, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly named.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the FTT:Power model in detail. They mention that the model uses historical data for parameterization, but I need to identify if they reference any specific datasets or sources of data used for this purpose.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on their simulations. They discuss the electricity mix and carbon emissions but do not explicitly mention datasets. However, they refer to the FTT:Power model, which may imply reliance on certain datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the study. The references include various papers and reports, but I need to determine if any of these correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite the FTT:Power model itself, which is crucial for understanding the data used in their simulations. The citation for the FTT:Power model is:

- **FTT:Power Model**: 
  > J. F. Mercure, “FTT:Power A global model of the power sector with induced technological change and natural resource depletion,” *Energy Policy*, vol. 48, pp. 799–811, 2012.

Additionally, the authors mention using historical data for the UK and Ireland electricity markets, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation for this data.

In conclusion, the primary dataset referenced in this paper is the FTT:Power model, which serves as the basis for their simulations. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
