To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition Challenge: Open Datasets, Tracks, Methods and Results" by Xian Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the challenge involves releasing **500 hours of Mandarin speech data** and **240 hours of Mandarin-English intra-sentential code-switching (CS) data**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Open Source Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets released for the challenge. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **TrainMan**: This dataset consists of **500 hours of Mandarin-only speech data**. It is specifically designed for training ASR systems focused on Mandarin.

2. **TrainCS**: This dataset contains **200 hours of intra-sentential Mandarin-English code-switching speech data**. It is intended for training ASR systems that need to handle code-switching scenarios.

3. **DevCS**: This dataset includes **40 hours of intra-sentential Mandarin-English code-switching speech data**. It is used for development and validation purposes in the challenge.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are released by DataTang for the challenge. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are part of the challenge organized by DataTang.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and the context in which they were released:

- **TrainMan**: 500 hours of Mandarin-only speech data released for training ASR systems.
- **TrainCS**: 200 hours of intra-sentential Mandarin-English code-switching speech data released for training ASR systems.
- **DevCS**: 40 hours of intra-sentential Mandarin-English code-switching speech data released for development and validation in the challenge.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I clearly indicate the source of the datasets as part of the ASRU 2019 challenge organized by DataTang.
