To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Policy Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Md Masudur Rahman and Yexiang Xue, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on several DeepMind Control robotic environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their evaluation setup. They mention evaluating their approach on **10 DeepMind Control locomotion environment settings**. This indicates that the DeepMind Control suite is a key dataset used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify the environments they used for evaluation, which include:
1. **Quadruped: Walk**
2. **Quadruped: Run**
3. **Quadruped: Escape**
4. **Dog: Walk**
5. **Dog: Run**
6. **Dog: Fetch**
7. **Hopper: Stand**
8. **Hopper: Hop**
9. **Walker: Stand**
10. **Walker: Walk**
11. **Walker: Run**
12. **Cheetah: Run**

These environments are part of the **DeepMind Control Suite**, which is a widely recognized benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DeepMind Control Suite. The relevant citation is:
> Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., Liu, S., Bohez, S., Merel, J., Erez, T., Lillicrap, T., Heess, N., & Tassa, Y. (2020). *dm control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. Software Impacts, 6, 100022.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This suite includes various robotic environments for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically designed for continuous control tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
