To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VER: Scaling On-Policy RL Leads to the Emergence of Navigation in Embodied Rearrangement" by Erik Wijmans et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of **Habitat 1.0** and **Habitat 2.0** for various navigation and manipulation tasks, which suggests that these may be datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of the **Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB)** and the **ReplicaCAD Dataset** in the context of their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide details about the tasks and the environments used, specifically mentioning the **Matterport 3D** dataset and the **YCB dataset**. This reinforces the need to include these datasets in my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ReplicaCAD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Szot, A., Clegg, A., Undersander, E., Wijmans, E., Zhao, Y., Turner, J., Maestre, N., Mukadam, M., Chaplot, D., Maksymets, O., Gokaslan, A., Galuba, W., Kira, Z., Koltun, V., Malik, J., Savva, M., & Batra, D. (2021). Habitat 2.0: Training home assistants to rearrange their habitat. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*.

2. **YCB Dataset**: The citation is:

3. **Matterport 3D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments. In *International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)*.

4. **Habitat Matterport Research Dataset**: The citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
