To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Synergies between Pushing and Grasping with Self-supervised Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Andy Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for training their models or for evaluating their performance. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of objects, types of tasks, or any unique features.

If the paper does not have a dedicated datasets section, I will check the **experiments** section, where the authors typically discuss the setup and the datasets used for testing their hypotheses. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Yale Face Database," I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Georghiades, A., Belhumeur, P. N., & Kriegman, D. J. (2001). "From Few to Many: Illumination Cone Models for Face Recognition under Variable Lighting and Pose." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 23(6), 634-640.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the **abstract** and **introduction** for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a **datasets section** or references in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections.
3. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics.
4. Check the **references section** for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information for clarity and future use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
