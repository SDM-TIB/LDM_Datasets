To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Split Moves for Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Jakub Kowalski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on," or "the experiments were conducted using."

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe how they collected or generated the datasets, I will note that information as well.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which will help confirm the datasets identified earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I identify a dataset called "Regular Boardgames," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Kowalski, J., Mika, M., Pawlik, W., Sutowicz, J., & Szyku≈Ça, M. (2019). Regular Boardgames. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1699-1706.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
