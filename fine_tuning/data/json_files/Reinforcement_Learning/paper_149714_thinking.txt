To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Functional Stability of Discounted Markov Decision Processes Using Economic MPC Dissipativity Theory" by Arash Bahari Kordabad and Sebastien Gros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there may not be a clearly labeled section for datasets, so I will need to look for mentions of datasets within the **experiments or methodology sections**. I will pay attention to any descriptions of data used for simulations, experiments, or evaluations.

If the paper discusses any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that are mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that are cited as the origin of the datasets.

If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that and provide a description based on the information available in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
