To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Evaluating Adaptivity of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Methods" by Yi Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail experimental setups or evaluations. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments, including any specific characteristics or configurations of those datasets.

In the **results** section, I will look for any mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the paper mentions the "MuJoCo Reacher domain" as a dataset, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper credit to the original sources.
