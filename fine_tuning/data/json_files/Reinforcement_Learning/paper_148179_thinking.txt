To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Graph based Image Retrieval - A case study on the CLEVR Dataset" by Sahana Ramnath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the datasets being referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **CLEVR dataset** and **CLEVR Dialog**, indicating that these are the primary datasets involved in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets. In this case, the **introduction** states that the proposed model is showcased on the **CLEVR dataset** and **CLEVR Dialog**, which confirms their relevance to the study.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references provide the necessary details for proper citation:

1. For the **CLEVR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Li Fei-Fei, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Ross Girshick. *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2901–2910, 2017.

2. For the **CLEVR Dialog dataset**, the citation is:
   > Satwik Kottur, José MF Moura, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, and Marcus Rohrbach. *CLEVR-Dialog: A diagnostic dataset for multi-round reasoning in visual dialog*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03166, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
