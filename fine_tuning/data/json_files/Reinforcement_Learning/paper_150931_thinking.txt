To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Light-weight End-to-end Transformer-Based Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Driving with Multi-Task Learning" by Pedram Agand et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in autonomous driving and mention the use of the **CARLA simulator** for their experiments. This indicates that the CARLA dataset is likely involved, but I need to confirm this in the methodology or experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they use the **CARLA dataset (version 0.9.10)** for their simulation environment, which includes 8 towns for training and testing. They also mention that they trained their model on a **210 GB publicly available dataset** presented in the **TransFuser** paper, which includes approximately 2500 routes through junctions and 1000 routes on curved highways.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Conference on robot learning, pages 1â€“16. PMLR, 2017.

2. For the **TransFuser dataset**, the citation is:
   > Kashyap Chitta, Aditya Prakash, Bernhard Jaeger, Zehao Yu, Katrin Renz, and Andreas Geiger. *Transfuser: Imitation with transformer-based sensor fusion for autonomous driving*. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
