To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-Aware Robot Navigation via Reinforcement Learning with Hindsight Experience Replay and Curriculum Learning" by Keyu Li, Ye Lu, and Max Q.-H. Meng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning for robot navigation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various approaches to robot navigation but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methods section**, where they describe their approach and any simulations or environments used for training and testing.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely. Here, the authors describe their simulation environment, which is built in Python and involves 5 humans navigating in a crowd. They mention using the **optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) method** for the humans' navigation policy, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. Instead, they indicate that the demonstration data was generated by navigating with the ORCA policy for 3000 episodes.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and methods rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they created their own simulation environment and generated data through the ORCA method.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the simulation environment and the methods used, it does not provide any specific datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned or used in the research.

Overall, my findings indicate that the authors relied on a custom simulation rather than established datasets, which is important to note for anyone looking to replicate or build upon this research.
