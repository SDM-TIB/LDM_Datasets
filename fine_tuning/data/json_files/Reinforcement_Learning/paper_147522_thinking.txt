To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Navigate in Cities Without a Map" by Piotr Mirowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed an interactive navigation environment using Google Street View, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **environment section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the interactive environment named **StreetLearn**. This section provides details about the dataset used, specifically mentioning that it is constructed using Google Street View images. The authors state that the environment includes large regions in New York City, Paris, and London, with specific details about the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

In the **environment section**, I will extract the following key points:

1. **StreetLearn Dataset**: This dataset is built using Google Street View, which provides a set of geolocated 360-degree panoramic images. The authors mention that they selected large regions in New York City, Paris, and London, with specific node and edge counts.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google Street View dataset. Since Google Street View is a widely recognized dataset, I will note that it is publicly available and does not have a specific citation like traditional datasets. However, I will mention it as follows:

- **StreetLearn Dataset**: 
  > Google. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified the **StreetLearn Dataset** as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have noted its source and availability. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets referenced in the paper.
