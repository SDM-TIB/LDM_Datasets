To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assumed Density Filtering Q-learning" by Heejin Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will note any datasets mentioned and their significance to the study.

I will then examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections usually contain explicit descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that provide the names, characteristics, and sources of the datasets.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 games** as a benchmark, I will look for the original source or dataset citation related to these games. Similarly, if they reference any specific datasets for reinforcement learning, I will ensure to find their complete citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurately documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
