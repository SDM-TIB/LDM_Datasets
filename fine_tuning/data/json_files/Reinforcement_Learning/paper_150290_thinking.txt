To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tuning Path Tracking Controllers for Autonomous Cars Using Reinforcement Learning" by Ana Vilaça Carrasco and João Silva Sequeira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the CARLA simulation environment was used for training and testing, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or a source of data for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **implementation and results sections**. In the implementation section, the authors describe the use of the CARLA simulator, which is an open-source platform for autonomous driving research. This is a key point, as it implies that the data generated from this simulator is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any details about the specific scenarios or configurations used in the CARLA simulator. If they mention any specific datasets or configurations that were used for training or testing, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the CARLA simulator and any other datasets mentioned. The citation for the CARLA simulator is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., Koltun, V. "CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator." In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 1–16. (2017).

If the paper mentions any specific datasets generated from the CARLA simulator or any other datasets used for validation, I will ensure to extract their full citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
