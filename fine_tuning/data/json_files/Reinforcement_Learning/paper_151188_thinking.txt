To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parametric-Task MAP-Elites" by Timoth√©e Anne and Jean-Baptiste Mouret, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental setups. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "two parametric-task toy problems and a robotic problem in simulation," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors detail three specific problems:

1. **10-DoF Arm**: This toy problem involves finding joint positions for different arm morphologies to reach a target. The task parameter space and solution space are defined, but no specific dataset citation is provided.

2. **Archery**: This problem involves shooting an arrow at a target, with parameters including distance and wind conditions. Again, while the problem is described, there is no explicit dataset citation.

3. **Door-Pulling**: This involves a humanoid robot pulling a door open, with detailed descriptions of the task parameters and solution space. However, like the previous problems, there is no dataset citation.

Since the paper does not reference external datasets but rather describes simulation environments and toy problems, I will note that these problems are conceptual frameworks rather than datasets in the traditional sense.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets or are related to datasets that could be relevant to the experiments. However, the references primarily consist of foundational works and related algorithms rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that while the authors describe three experimental setups, they do not provide specific datasets with citations. Instead, they focus on the methodology and results of their proposed algorithm.

In summary, I will document the three experimental setups as follows:

1. **10-DoF Arm**: No dataset citation provided; described as a toy problem for optimization.
2. **Archery**: No dataset citation provided; described as a toy problem for optimization.
3. **Door-Pulling**: No dataset citation provided; described as a robotic simulation problem.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will note this in my final output. This process highlights the importance of distinguishing between datasets and experimental setups in research papers.
