To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal Reasoning by Selecting Subgoals with Deep Q-Learning" by Carlos Núñez-Molina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on a standard video game environment, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their methodology and the specific games used for testing. In this section, they mention three different GVGAI games: **BoulderDash**, **IceAndFire**, and **Catapults**. I will look for details about how datasets were created or collected for these games.

In the **experiments and analysis of results** section, the authors provide information about the datasets used for training their architecture. They mention that they collected datasets by performing random exploration in the training levels of each game. Specifically, they state:

1. **BoulderDash**: 50,000 training samples were collected from 100 training levels.
2. **IceAndFire**: 42,950 training samples were collected from 100 training levels.
3. **Catapults**: 60,018 training samples were collected from 200 training levels.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are derived from the games used in the GVGAI framework, I will cite the GVGAI framework paper as the authoritative source for these datasets:

- For **GVGAI Framework**, the citation is:
  > Perez-Liebana, D., Samothrakis, S., Togelius, J., Schaul, T., Lucas, S. M., Couetoux, A., Lee, J., Lim, C.-U., & Thompson, T. (2015). The 2014 General Video Game Playing Competition. *IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games*, 8(3), 229-243.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names of the games, the number of samples, and the citation for the GVGAI framework.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
