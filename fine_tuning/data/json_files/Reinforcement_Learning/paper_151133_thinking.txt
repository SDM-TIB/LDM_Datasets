To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing k in kNN Graphs with Graph Learning Perspective" by Asuka Tamaru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on real datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **Iris dataset** and **ModelNet** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. For the **Iris dataset**, I will look for the original source or a commonly cited reference. The citation for the Iris dataset is typically attributed to:

> R. A. Fisher, "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems," Annals of Eugenics, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 179-188, 1936.

For **ModelNet**, I will find the citation that describes the dataset and its use in point cloud processing. The citation for ModelNet is:

> A. Wu, et al., "3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
