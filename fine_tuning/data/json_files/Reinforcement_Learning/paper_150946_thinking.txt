To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Scale Robustness for Proximal Policy Optimization via DreamerV3 Tricks" by Ryan Sullivan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Arcade Learning Environment** and the **DeepMind Control Suite**, indicating that these environments may contain datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Environments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they trained agents on **57 environments in the Arcade Learning Environment** and **35 proprioceptive control environments from the DeepMind Control Suite**. This suggests that both of these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments:

1. For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2012. doi: 10.1613/jair.3912. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708.

2. For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Sergey Levina, and David Silver. *DeepMind Control Suite*. CoRR, abs/1801.00690, 2018. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Arcade Learning Environment** with its citation.
- **DeepMind Control Suite** with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding citations from the research paper.
