To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GST: Group-Sparse Training for Accelerating Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Juhyoung Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of specific environments for testing the proposed method, which suggests that datasets or benchmarks are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models and reference various DRL algorithms and environments. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets and environments used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Mujoco Halfcheetah-v2** and **Mujoco Humanoid-v2** environments for evaluating their proposed method. These environments are commonly used benchmarks in the DRL community.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Mujoco environments are well-known, and their citations can be found in the following references:

- For **Mujoco Halfcheetah-v2**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 5026-5033.

- For **Mujoco Humanoid-v2**, the citation is the same as for Halfcheetah, as both environments are part of the Mujoco physics engine.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the datasets.
