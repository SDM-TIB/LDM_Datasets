To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitate then Transcend: Multi-Agent Optimal Execution with Dual-Window Denoise PPO" by Jin Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using **NASDAQ nano-second level message data from five tickers** for training and testing their reinforcement learning agents. This indicates that there is a dataset related to historical limit order book (LOB) data.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **ABIDES simulator** as the environment for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The specific datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **NASDAQ nano-second level message data**: This dataset consists of high-frequency trading data from five tickers over a period of 19 days, with the first 12 days used for training and the last 7 days for testing.

To provide a complete citation for the dataset, I will refer to the original source of the ABIDES simulator, which is mentioned in the references:

- For the **ABIDES simulator**, the citation is:
  > David Byrd, Maria Hybinette, and Tucker Hybinette Balch. *Abides: Towards high-fidelity multi-agent market simulation*. In Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation, pages 11â€“22, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the information is complete and ready for further processing or review.
