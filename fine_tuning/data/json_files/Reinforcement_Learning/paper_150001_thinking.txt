To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAFARI: Versatile and Efficient Evaluations for Robustness of Interpretability" by Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using **three public benchmark datasets**: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CelebA**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, such as the image sizes and any specific attributes mentioned in the context of the experiments.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

3. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015. [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or reporting.

By following these steps, I ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each one.
