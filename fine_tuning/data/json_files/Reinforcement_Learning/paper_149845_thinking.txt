To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Adversarial Attacks Detection based on Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV Guidance and Planning" by Thomas Hickling, Nabil Aouf, and Phillippa Spencer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a detector for adversarial attacks on UAVs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of a simulated environment for UAV guidance and planning, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the methodology section.

In the **methodology**, the authors describe the use of AirSim, a high-fidelity simulation environment, for generating training data. This indicates that the data used for training the models is not a traditional dataset but rather generated data from a simulation. I will note this as a dataset source.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any references to specific datasets or data generation methods. The authors mention using AirSim in conjunction with Unreal Engine 4 for simulation, which reinforces that the data is generated rather than sourced from a pre-existing dataset.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the focus of the paper appears to be on the simulation data generated through AirSim, and there are no traditional datasets referenced.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Simulated Data from AirSim**: The paper utilizes a simulated environment (AirSim) to generate training data for the UAV guidance and planning tasks. This data is not a traditional dataset but is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Since there are no traditional datasets cited in the paper, I will provide the citation for the AirSim tool used for generating the data:

- For **AirSim**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
