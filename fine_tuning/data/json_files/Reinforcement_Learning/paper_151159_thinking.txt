To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Genetic Algorithms Performance via Deterministic Population Shrinkage" by Juan Luis Jim√©nez Laredo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the empirical study of a variable population sizing scheme, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention conducting experiments on **trap functions**, which are a type of benchmark used in evolutionary computation. However, they do not refer to a specific dataset in the traditional sense, as trap functions are mathematical constructs rather than datasets derived from real-world data.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might have been used in conjunction with the experiments. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works related to genetic algorithms and population sizing, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, I will summarize the relevant experimental setups instead. The authors describe the use of **2-trap, 3-trap, and 4-trap functions** as the basis for their experiments, which are defined mathematically rather than being sourced from external datasets.

In conclusion, while I will not be able to provide traditional dataset citations, I will note the experimental functions used in the study:

1. **2-Trap Function**: A mathematical function used for testing GA performance.
2. **3-Trap Function**: Another mathematical function with characteristics between deceptive and non-deceptive landscapes.
3. **4-Trap Function**: A deceptive function used to evaluate GA performance.

Since these are not datasets in the conventional sense, I will not provide citations as they do not exist in the context of this paper. Instead, I will document the functions as part of the experimental methodology.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
