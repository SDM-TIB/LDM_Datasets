To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization" by Yunhao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which often includes references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

I will also check the **appendices** if available, as they sometimes contain additional details about the datasets or supplementary datasets that were used in the experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **Atari Learning Environment** as a dataset, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
