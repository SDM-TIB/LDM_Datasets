To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Classification Performance via Reinforcement Learning for Feature Selection" by Younes Ghazagh Jahed and Seyyed Ali Sadat Tavana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the study uses the **Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset (BCCDS)**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to gather more context about the dataset. The introduction emphasizes the importance of feature selection and mentions the BCCDS again, confirming its relevance to the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors detail how they applied reinforcement learning algorithms to the BCCDS, which further solidifies the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results and discussion** sections. The results section provides a summary of the BCCDS, including its structure and the number of samples, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCDS)**:
  > P. J. C. J. M. P. S. R. Patrcio Miguel and F. Caramelo, "Breast Cancer Coimbra." 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset's name, description, and citation are accurately represented.
