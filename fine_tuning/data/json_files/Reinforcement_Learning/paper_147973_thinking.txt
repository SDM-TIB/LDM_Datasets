To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering the Game of Sungka from Random Play" by Raimarc Dionido and Darwin Bautista, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention the context of the research and any relevant datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the implementation of their reinforcement learning agent. They mention using the OpenAI Gym toolkit to create an environment for the game of Sungka. This suggests that they may have developed a custom dataset or environment for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for training or testing the DQN agent. The authors discuss various policies and training setups, but I need to confirm if they reference any external datasets or if they created their own dataset for the game of Sungka.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. If the authors refer to any existing datasets or environments, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each.

In this paper, it appears that the authors primarily focus on the development of a custom environment for the game of Sungka rather than utilizing established datasets. Therefore, I will document the OpenAI Gym environment they created as a dataset.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym toolkit is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., et al. "OpenAI Gym." 2016. eprint: arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset(s) identified, including their descriptions and full citations.
