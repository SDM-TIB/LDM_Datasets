To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dimension-Wise Importance Sampling Weight Clipping for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning" by Seungyul Han and Youngchul Sung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which they are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on various OpenAI Gym tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are involved.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors refer to several environments from the OpenAI Gym, such as:

1. **Ant-v1**: A continuous control task where the agent learns to walk.
2. **HalfCheetah-v1**: Another continuous control task focused on locomotion.
3. **Hopper-v1**: A task where the agent must balance and move forward.
4. **Humanoid-v1**: A more complex task involving a humanoid robot.
5. **Walker2d-v1**: A task where the agent learns to walk in a 2D environment.

These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The OpenAI Gym is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to include the citation for it:

- For OpenAI Gym, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
