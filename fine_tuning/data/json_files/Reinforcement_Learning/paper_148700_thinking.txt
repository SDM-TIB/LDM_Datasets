To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Adversarial Examples for Simulated Autonomous Driving with Fast and Differentiable Image Compositing" by Jinghan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of the Carla autonomous driving simulator, which suggests that it may be a key dataset or tool used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the context of adversarial attacks in autonomous driving but does not specify datasets yet. However, it does reference the Carla simulator, indicating its importance in the experiments.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, particularly looking for a subsection that discusses datasets or experimental setups. In this section, the authors mention using the Carla simulator for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any detailed descriptions of how the Carla simulator is utilized. The authors describe the calibration and simulation processes, which further confirms that Carla is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **references** section to find the full citation for the Carla simulator. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Carla simulator**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1â€“16, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Carla simulator, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the introduction for context and references to datasets.
3. Analyze the experiments section for explicit dataset usage.
4. Check the methodology for details on the dataset's application.
5. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
