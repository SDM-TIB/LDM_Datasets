To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DGAFF: Deep Genetic Algorithm Fitness Formation for EEG Bio-Signal Channel Selection" by Ghazaleh Ghorbanzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on channel selection methods for EEG signals, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset utilized in their experiments. Here, they mention using **dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV**, which is a motor-imagery dataset. The details provided include the number of classes, the number of subjects, and the specifics of the data acquisition process.

The authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from nine healthy subjects, with data collected through 22 electrodes. It includes four classes corresponding to different imagined movements (left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue). Each subject's data is recorded over two sessions, with a total of 288 trials per session.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for the BCI Competition IV dataset is as follows:
> Brunner, C., et al. "BCI Competition 2008 - Graz data set A." 2008.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are accurately captured.
