To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting Large Language Models for Counterfactual Generation: An Empirical Study" by Yongqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors often discuss the performance of their models on various datasets. This section may also provide additional insights into the datasets, such as their size, the number of samples, and the specific tasks they were used for.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided in the text. For example, the paper mentions several datasets for different natural language understanding tasks, such as:

1. **SST-2**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
2. **IMDB**: Another dataset for sentiment analysis.
3. **SNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
4. **MNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
5. **CoNLL2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
6. **OntoNotes**: Another dataset for named entity recognition.
7. **SemEval**: A dataset for relation extraction.
8. **TACRED**: Another dataset for relation extraction.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, the citations I might find include:

- For **SST-2**:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–642.

- For **CoNLL2003**:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
