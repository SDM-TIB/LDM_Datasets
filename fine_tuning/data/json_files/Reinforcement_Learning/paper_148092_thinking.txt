To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-DATA: Enhanced Traffic Flow Monitoring in Software-Defined Networks applying Q-learning" by Trung V. Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a traffic flow monitoring framework called Q-DATA, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does indicate that experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe the experimental setup, including the use of the **MaxiNet framework** to emulate an SDN network with specific components (3 Web servers and 5 hosts). However, they do not provide a specific dataset name but rather describe the experimental environment.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **related work** or **methodology** sections, as these sections may provide insights into datasets used in previous studies or methodologies that involve datasets.

In the **References section**, I will check for any cited works that may refer to datasets. The authors reference various papers, but I need to identify if any of these papers are associated with datasets relevant to their experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered. If specific datasets are not named in the paper, I will note that the authors used simulated data generated through the MaxiNet framework, which may not have a formal citation but is essential for understanding the context of their experiments.

If I find any datasets mentioned in the references, I will ensure to write down their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset from a previous study, I will include that citation in my final output.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I clearly state whether specific datasets were used or if the experiments relied on simulated data, and provide full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper.
