To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoGS: Causality Constrained Counterfactual Explanations using goal-directed ASP" by Sopam Dasgupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **German dataset**, **Adult dataset**, and **Car Evaluation dataset** for experiments, which indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets in detail. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **German Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing demographic data with labels for credit risk ('good' or 'bad'). They also mention that the dataset is imbalanced, with 'good' ratings outnumbering 'bad' ratings.

2. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset includes demographic information with labels indicating income levels ('=< $50k/year' or '> $50k/year'). The authors detail how they applied their methodology to this dataset to find counterfactuals.

3. **Car Evaluation Dataset**: The authors explain that they relabeled this dataset to classify cars as 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable' for purchase.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hofmann, H. (1994). Statlog (German Credit Data). UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5NC77

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Becker, B., & Kohavi, R. (1996). Adult. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20

- For the **Car Evaluation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bohanec, M. (1997). Car Evaluation. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5JP48

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its features, and the corresponding citations.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and provide proper attribution, which is crucial for academic integrity and further research.
