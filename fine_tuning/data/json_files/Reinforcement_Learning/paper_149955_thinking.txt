To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resolving Copycat Problems in Visual Imitation Learning via Residual Action Prediction" by Chia-Chi Chuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions benchmarking the proposed method on two widely used simulators, **CARLA** and **MuJoCo**, which suggests that datasets related to these simulators may be included.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup in detail. They mention using the **CARLA100 dataset**, which consists of 100 hours of driving data collected in the CARLA simulator. They also refer to the **MuJoCo-Image** datasets for various continuous control environments, specifically mentioning tasks like Hopper, HalfCheetah, and Walker2D.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. **CARLA100 Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as consisting of 100 hours of driving data collected in the CARLA simulator. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Codevilla, F., Santana, E., López, A.M., & Gaidon, A. (2019). *Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9328–9337.

2. **MuJoCo-Image Datasets**: The authors mention using datasets from the MuJoCo simulator for tasks like Hopper, HalfCheetah, and Walker2D. The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026–5033.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
