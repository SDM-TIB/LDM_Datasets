To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling for Reinforcement Learning Problems in High-dimension" by Udari Madhushani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for generating data for reinforcement learning, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention applying their method to several benchmark control tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the following tasks:

1. **Double Pendulum on a Cart**: The paper describes the setup and dynamics of this system, but it does not refer to a specific dataset. Instead, it outlines the state space and the reward function used for the experiments.

2. **Inverted Pendulum**: Similar to the double pendulum, the authors describe the dynamics and the reward function without referencing a specific dataset.

3. **Cartpole**: Again, the authors provide details about the system dynamics and the reward function but do not mention a dataset.

4. **Acrobot**: The paper describes the acrobot system and its dynamics, but no specific dataset is cited.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works refer to datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that several papers are cited, but they primarily focus on methodologies and algorithms rather than specific datasets. The authors do not provide full citations for any datasets used in their experiments, which is a crucial aspect for proper documentation.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses various control tasks and their setups, it does not provide specific datasets or full citations for any datasets used in the experiments. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, and I will document this finding accordingly.

Now, I will summarize my findings:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The experiments were conducted on control tasks (double pendulum, inverted pendulum, cartpole, acrobot) without referencing datasets.
- No full citations for datasets were provided in the references.

This concludes the extraction process for datasets from this research paper.
