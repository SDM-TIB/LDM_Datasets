To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Q-learning with Adaptation and Momentum Restart for Gradient Descent" by Bowen Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a linear quadratic regulator problem and a batch of Atari 2600 games, indicating that datasets related to these experiments might be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Atari 2600 games** as a benchmark for evaluating their Q-learning algorithms. This suggests that the Atari dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **supplementary material**, the authors provide further details about the Atari games evaluated. They list 23 specific games, which include titles like "Alien," "Amidar," "Assault," and others. This list confirms that the Atari 2600 games dataset is indeed a significant part of their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The Atari 2600 games are widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community, and the authors reference the original dataset in their paper. The citation for the Atari dataset is:

- For the **Atari 2600 games** dataset, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a **linear quadratic regulator (LQR)** problem, which is a standard problem in control theory. However, they do not provide a specific dataset for LQR as it is typically a theoretical construct rather than a dataset per se.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The primary dataset extracted from this paper is the Atari 2600 games dataset, which is crucial for their experimental validation.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the Atari 2600 games dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
