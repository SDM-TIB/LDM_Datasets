To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion-based Iterative Counterfactual Explanations for Fetal Ultrasound Image Quality Assessment" by Paraskevas Pegios et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the generation of counterfactuals for fetal ultrasound images, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of image quality in obstetric ultrasound but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **GROWTH dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,363 fetal ultrasound images from growth scans, including various anatomical images. The authors specify the split for training and testing (2,842 for training and 1,521 for testing).

2. **HEAD dataset**: This dataset is used to train and test the guiding classifier and includes 240 high-quality standard planes (SP) and 1,339 low-quality non-standard planes (NSP).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from a national fetal ultrasound screening database and are anonymized, there may not be a specific citation for them. Instead, I will note that the datasets are part of a larger screening database and provide the context given in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with the following details:

- **GROWTH dataset**: 4,363 fetal ultrasound images from growth scans (2,842 for training, 1,521 for testing). No specific citation available as it is part of an anonymized national database.
  
- **HEAD dataset**: 240 high-quality standard planes and 1,339 low-quality non-standard planes. Again, no specific citation available as it is part of the same anonymized database.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the context regarding the lack of formal citations due to the anonymized nature of the data.
