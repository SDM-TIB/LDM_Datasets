To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adjusting for Confounders with Text: Challenges and an Empirical Evaluation Framework for Causal Inference" by Galen Weld et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate causal methods on two datasets inspired by previous social media studies, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the experiments conducted. The authors mention two specific experiments: the **Moderation Experiment** and the **Gender Experiment**. I will look for details about the datasets used in these experiments.

1. **Moderation Experiment**: The authors describe using a dataset of **13,786 public Reddit histories** from users in the /r/science subreddit. This dataset is crucial for understanding the impact of post removals by moderators on user behavior.

2. **Gender Experiment**: The authors utilize a dataset made public by Veitch, Sridhar, and Blei (2019), which consists of single posts from three subreddits: **/r/okcupid, /r/childfree, and /r/keto**. Each post is annotated with the gender of the poster, which is considered the treatment variable.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Moderation Experiment**, the dataset is derived from the Pushshift Reddit API, which is referenced in the paper:
  > Baumgartner, J.; Zannettou, S.; Keegan, B.; Squire, M.; and Blackburn, J. (2020). *The Pushshift Reddit Dataset*. arXiv:2001.08435.

- For the **Gender Experiment**, the citation for the dataset used is:
  > Veitch, V.; Sridhar, D.; and Blei, D. M. (2019). *Using Text Embeddings for Causal Inference*. arXiv:1905.12741.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Reddit Histories Dataset** for the Moderation Experiment.
2. **Gender Dataset** from Veitch et al. for the Gender Experiment.

I will now prepare to format these datasets according to the specified requirements.
