To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entertainment chatbot for the digital inclusion of elderly people without abstraction capabilities" by Silvia García-Méndez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the EBER chatbot and its purpose but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In these sections, the authors describe the experiments conducted with elderly users, including the setup and the data collected. I will look for any references to datasets used for training, testing, or evaluating the chatbot.

Upon reviewing the **experimental results**, I find that the authors mention a dataset used for training the sentiment analysis (SA) module. They state that they trained selected machine learning algorithms on a dataset of 676 negative, 1,334 neutral, and 918 positive clauses. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Since the dataset is not named, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations that might relate to the dataset used for sentiment analysis. I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of user interactions or chatbot training.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to sentiment analysis and natural language processing, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset used in their experiments. This indicates that the dataset may be proprietary or not publicly available.

Given this information, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets as follows:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: The authors used a dataset consisting of 676 negative, 1,334 neutral, and 918 positive clauses for training their sentiment analysis module. However, no specific citation or name for this dataset is provided in the paper.

Since the paper lacks explicit dataset citations, I will note that while the authors reference the dataset used for training the sentiment analysis module, they do not provide a formal citation for it. This is an important aspect to highlight, as it may affect the reproducibility of their research.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to note the absence of specific dataset citations while documenting the details provided in the paper.
