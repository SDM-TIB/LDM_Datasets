To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Symbolic Machines: Learning Semantic Parsers on Freebase with Weak Supervision" by Chen Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on **WEBQUESTIONSSP**, which suggests that this dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically discussed. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using the **WEBQUESTIONSSP** dataset, describing it as consisting of 3,098 question-answer pairs for training and 1,639 for testing. They also note that the questions were collected using the Google Suggest API and that the answers were obtained through Amazon Mechanical Turk.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Wen-tau Yih, Matthew Richardson, Chris Meek, Ming-Wei Chang, and Jina Suh. *The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question answering*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **WEBQUESTIONSSP**: A dataset consisting of 3,098 training question-answer pairs and 1,639 testing pairs, collected using Google Suggest API and annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for WEBQUESTIONSSP, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for structured output or further processing.
