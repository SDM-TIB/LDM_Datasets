To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Playing Carcassonne with Monte Carlo Tree Search" by Fred Valdez Ameneyro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the data used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the data used for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets or sequences of data that were utilized in their simulations. In this case, the authors mention using a set of **100 sequences of tiles** that were pre-defined at random for the game of Carcassonne. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the game sequences.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that may have been used in the analysis or comparisons. The authors may refer to specific datasets or metrics derived from the data they collected during their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this paper, the authors do not appear to reference external datasets but rather describe their own experimental setup. Therefore, I will note the dataset as follows:

1. **Tile Sequences Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 pre-defined sequences of tiles used in the game of Carcassonne. The sequences represent the order of the 71 tiles in the stack for a game.

Since the dataset is created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments, I will provide a citation for the paper itself as the source of this dataset:

- For the **Tile Sequences Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fred Valdez Ameneyro, Edgar Galván, Ángel Fernando Kuri Morales. *Playing Carcassonne with Monte Carlo Tree Search*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
