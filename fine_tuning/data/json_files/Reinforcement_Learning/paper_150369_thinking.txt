To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Satellite Anomaly Detection Using Variance Based Genetic Ensemble of Neural Networks" by Mohammad Amin Maleki Sadr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use telemetry datasets from NASA for their study, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**, particularly looking for any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In this case, the authors mention two telemetry datasets from NASA: the **Curiosity Rover on Mars (MSL)** and the **Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite (SMAP)**. They provide a summary of these datasets in **Table I**, which includes key characteristics such as the number of signals, dimensions, data points, and anomaly points.

To ensure I have all necessary details, I will also check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets. The paper cites the following references that are relevant to the datasets:

1. For the **Curiosity Rover (MSL)** dataset, the citation is:
   > K. Hundman, V. Constantinou, C. Laporte, I. Colwell, and T. Soderstrom. "Detecting spacecraft anomalies using LSTMs and nonparametric dynamic thresholding." In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2018, pp. 387â€“395.

2. For the **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)** dataset, the citation is:
   > E.-H. Li, Y.-Z. Li, T.-T. Li, J.-X. Li, Z.-Z. Zhai, and T. Li. "Intelligent analysis algorithm for satellite health under time-varying and extremely high thermal loads." Entropy, vol. 21, no. 10, p. 983, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

1. **Curiosity Rover (MSL) Dataset**: 
   - Signals: 27
   - Number of Dimensions: 55
   - Number of Data Points: 132,046
   - Number of Anomaly Points: 7,766
   - Citation: K. Hundman et al. (2018)

2. **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Dataset**: 
   - Signals: 55
   - Number of Dimensions: 25
   - Number of Data Points: 562,800
   - Number of Anomaly Points: 54,696
   - Citation: E.-H. Li et al. (2019)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
