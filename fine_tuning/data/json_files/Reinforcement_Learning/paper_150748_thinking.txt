To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An automated pipeline for quantitative T2* fetal body MRI and segmentation at low field" by Kelly Payette et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a semi-automatic pipeline for quantitative MRI of the fetal body, which suggests that there may be datasets related to fetal MRI involved in the study. The introduction provides context about the use of low-field MRI and its advantages, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly focusing on the **image acquisition** and **image processing** subsections. Here, the authors describe the scanning process and the parameters used, which may indicate the datasets they worked with. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to specific datasets used for validation or analysis. The authors discuss the results of their segmentation and reconstruction processes, which may involve specific datasets that were analyzed.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been explicitly stated earlier in the paper. The authors may discuss the implications of their findings in relation to existing datasets or studies.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

Based on my review of the paper, I will identify and summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Fetal MRI Dataset**: This dataset includes multi-echo dynamic scans of the fetal body acquired from 41 subjects, with a mean gestational age of 28.46 weeks. The dataset is used for quantitative T2* analysis and segmentation of fetal organs.

2. **Growth Curves Dataset**: This dataset contains normative T2* growth curves for ten fetal body organs across a range of gestational ages (17-40 weeks). It is derived from the segmentation and reconstruction processes described in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references section. If the datasets are original to this study, I will note that they are part of the authors' research and provide the citation for the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly attributed.
