To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Agent based modelling for continuously varying supply chains" by Wan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges and methodologies related to reinforcement learning in supply chain management. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced or implied in the context of their experiments.

In the **methodology** section, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the environments used for testing the reinforcement learning algorithms. The authors mention using environments developed for exploring reinforcement learning, specifically citing **Kosasih and Brintrup (2021)**. I will check if these environments are associated with any datasets.

I will also examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their models. If they mention specific datasets or provide references to prior works that include datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper references the environments from **Kosasih and Brintrup (2021)**, I will look up the full citation for that work to include it in my dataset documentation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
