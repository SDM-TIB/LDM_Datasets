To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolution as a Service: A Privacy-Preserving Genetic Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization" by Bowen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluate their proposed method on **four TSP datasets**: **gr48, kroA100, eil101, and kroB200**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are significant for the research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets within the text, so I will need to look up the original sources for each dataset:

1. **gr48 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the TSPLIB, which is a library of sample instances for the traveling salesman problem and related problems. The citation for the TSPLIB is:
   > G. Reinelt. "TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library." ORSA Journal on Computing, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 376-384, 1991.

2. **kroA100 Dataset**: This dataset is also part of the TSPLIB. The citation remains the same as above since it is included in the same library.

3. **eil101 Dataset**: This dataset is included in the TSPLIB as well. The citation is the same:
   > G. Reinelt. "TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library." ORSA Journal on Computing, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 376-384, 1991.

4. **kroB200 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the TSPLIB too, and the citation is the same:
   > G. Reinelt. "TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library." ORSA Journal on Computing, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 376-384, 1991.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
- **gr48 Dataset**: A TSP instance from TSPLIB.
- **kroA100 Dataset**: A TSP instance from TSPLIB.
- **eil101 Dataset**: A TSP instance from TSPLIB.
- **kroB200 Dataset**: A TSP instance from TSPLIB.

All datasets are cited from the same source, the TSPLIB library, which is a well-known repository for TSP instances.
