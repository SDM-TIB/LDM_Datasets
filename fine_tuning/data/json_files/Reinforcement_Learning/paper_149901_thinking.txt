To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining the root causes of unit-level changes" by Kailash Budhathoki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for understanding changes in output variables and mention a case study involving earnings data from surveys conducted in 1976 and 1982. This indicates that there is a dataset related to earnings that I need to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their case study using the **Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)**, which is a longitudinal survey of households in the United States. They specifically mention using data from the surveys conducted in 1976 and 1982, focusing on a sample of 595 individuals.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, including variable descriptions and data sources. The paper includes a table that describes the variables used in the earnings data, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)**: This dataset is used to analyze changes in earnings over time. The authors mention that the data is available online as the dataset “PSID7682” from the R package “AER” with the GPLv3 license.

Next, I will ensure I have the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the PSID in the context of their analysis, and I will look for the original source or citation in the references section.

The citation for the PSID is:
> Johnson, D. S., McGonagle, K. A., Freedman, V. A., & Sastry, N. (2018). Fifty years of the panel study of income dynamics: Past, present, and future. *The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science*, 680(1), 9-28.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets for further analysis or reference.
