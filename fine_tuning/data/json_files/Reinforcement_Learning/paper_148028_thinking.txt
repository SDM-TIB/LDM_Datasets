To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Policy Gradients: Direct Optimization of Policies in Discrete Action Spaces" by Guy Lorberbom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments and could mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will identify any datasets that are used for empirical evaluation. For example, if the authors mention using a specific environment or benchmark for their experiments, I will note these down. I will also look for any descriptions of the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or any specific features that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions using a dataset like "MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N6-v0," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger framework or benchmark, I will cite the original source of that framework.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing clear references for future research and validation.
