To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Review of Machine Learning Methods for Additive Manufacturing of Functionally Graded Materials" by Mohammad Karimzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on machine learning techniques in additive manufacturing, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges and applications of additive manufacturing and mentions functionally graded materials (FGMs), but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into **section 5 (Machine Learning Methods for FGMs Fabrication)**, which is likely to contain references to datasets used in the studies reviewed. This section discusses various studies and their methodologies, which may include datasets used for training machine learning models.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. For example, if a study references a dataset used for training a machine learning model, I will capture that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For instance, if a dataset is mentioned in the context of a specific study, I will ensure to include the citation for that study. If the dataset is publicly available or comes from a specific source, I will also note that.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing.
