To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network" by Ivan Sorokin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm was tested on multiple Atari 2600 games, which indicates that these games may serve as datasets for the experiments. 

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) to identify the specific Atari games used for testing the Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network (DARQN). The authors list five games: **Breakout, Seaquest, Space Invaders, Tutankham, and Gopher**. This is a clear indication that these games are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets. Since these games are well-known, I will look for authoritative sources that describe them. The citations for the Atari games are typically not included in the references, as they are widely recognized datasets in the reinforcement learning community. However, I can provide general citations for the Atari 2600 games based on their common usage in research:

1. **Atari 2600 Games**: The Atari 2600 games are often referenced collectively in the context of reinforcement learning research. A common citation for the use of these games in deep reinforcement learning is:
   > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellemare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, et al. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529â€“533, 2015.

This citation refers to the foundational work that introduced the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and utilized these Atari games for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Breakout**: An arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.
2. **Seaquest**: An underwater adventure game where the player controls a submarine to rescue divers while avoiding enemies.
3. **Space Invaders**: A classic shooting game where the player defends against waves of descending aliens.
4. **Tutankham**: An action-adventure game where the player navigates through a maze to collect treasures while avoiding enemies.
5. **Gopher**: A game where the player controls a character to catch gophers while avoiding obstacles.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the appropriate citation for the Atari games as a whole, as individual citations for each game are not typically provided in the literature.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, along with their citations, ready for further processing or review.
