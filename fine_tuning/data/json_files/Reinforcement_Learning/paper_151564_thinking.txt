To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning with Adaptive World Models for Autonomous Driving" by Arun Balajee Vasudevan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the **nuPlan** benchmark, which is a key dataset used in the research. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experiments section** is likely to contain information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will also check the **related works** section, as it may reference other datasets that are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the **nuPlan dataset**, describing it as containing approximately 10 million driving logs collected from various cities, including Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, and Singapore. This is a significant dataset for the research, and I need to ensure I capture its details accurately.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuPlan dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> H. Caesar, J. Kabzan, K. S. Tan, W. K. Fong, E. Wolff, A. Lang, L. Fletcher, O. Beijbom, and S. Omari. *nuPlan: A closed-loop ML-based planning benchmark for autonomous vehicles*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11810, 2021.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **nuPlan Dataset**: This dataset includes around 10 million driving logs collected from various cities, which are used to evaluate motion planning algorithms in a reactive environment.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
