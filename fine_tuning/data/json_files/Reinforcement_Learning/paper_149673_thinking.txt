To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Infer Belief Embedded Communication" by Guo Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific environments or datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three multi-agent environments:

1. **PredatorPrey**: This environment is referenced multiple times, and the authors describe its setup and the specific parameters used for their experiments.

2. **Traffic Junction**: The authors also detail this environment, including its variations and how it is structured for the experiments.

3. **Level-based Foraging**: This environment is mentioned as well, with a description of its mechanics and how it differs from the other environments.

I will ensure to note the specific references to these environments, as they are crucial for understanding the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. The citations for the environments are as follows:

- For **PredatorPrey**, the citation is:
  > Singh, A., Jain, T., & Sukhbaatar, S. (2018). Learning when to communicate at scale in multiagent cooperative and competitive tasks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.09755.

- For **Traffic Junction**, the citation is:
  > Koul, A. (2019). ma-gym: Collection of multi-agent environments based on OpenAI Gym. https://github.com/koulanurag/ma-gym.

- For **Level-based Foraging**, the citation is:
  > Papoudakis, G., Christianos, F., Sch√§fer, L., & Albrecht, S. V. (2021). Benchmarking multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms in cooperative tasks. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks (NeurIPS).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
