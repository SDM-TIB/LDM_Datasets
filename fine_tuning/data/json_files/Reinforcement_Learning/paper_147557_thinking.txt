To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Learning Optimal Policies from Observational Data" by Onur Atan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors illustrate their methods on a **semi-synthetic breast cancer dataset** and a **supervised UCI dataset (Statlog)**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at **section 6 (Numerical Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 records of breast cancer patients from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP). It includes various features such as age, menopausal status, race, and treatment outcomes. The authors reference the dataset as being derived from the work of Yoon et al. (2016).

2. **UCI Statlog Dataset**: This dataset contains multi-spectral values of pixels in a satellite image, with the goal of predicting the true description of the plot. The authors mention that they follow the procedure outlined by Beygelzimer and Langford (2009) for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Breast Cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yoon, J., Davtyan, C., & van der Schaar, M. (2016). Discovery and clinical decision support for personalized healthcare. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*.

- For the **UCI Statlog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Beygelzimer, A., & Langford, J. (2009). The offset tree for learning with partial labels. In *Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 129â€“138).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
