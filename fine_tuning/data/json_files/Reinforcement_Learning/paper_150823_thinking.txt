To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Deep Q-Learning-based Path Selection and Service Placement for Latency-Sensitive Beyond 5G Applications" by Masoud Shokrnezhad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their research. This section often provides context and may highlight the datasets that are foundational to the study.

Then, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the original citation for that dataset, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be used for further analysis or replication of the study.
