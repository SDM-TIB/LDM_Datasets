To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SynWoodScape: Synthetic Surround-view Fisheye Camera Dataset for Autonomous Driving" by Ahmed Rida Sekkat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract indicates that the authors released a synthetic version of the WoodScape dataset, which suggests that both the original WoodScape dataset and the new SynWoodScape dataset are important.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the **II. SYNWOODSCAPE** section describes the SynWoodScape dataset in detail, including its features and the tasks it supports. It mentions that the dataset contains 80,000 images with annotations for over 10 tasks, which is crucial information.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors reference any other datasets used for comparison or evaluation. The paper mentions the original WoodScape dataset as a baseline for comparison with the new SynWoodScape dataset, which is important for understanding the context of the research.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **SynWoodScape Dataset**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper. It is a synthetic dataset generated from the CARLA Simulator, containing 80,000 frames with various annotations for tasks such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, motion segmentation, depth estimation, and more.

2. **WoodScape Dataset**: This is the original dataset that the SynWoodScape dataset builds upon. It is mentioned as a public fisheye surround-view dataset that was previously released.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **WoodScape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yogamani, S., Hughes, C., Horgan, J., Sistu, G., Varley, P., O'Dea, D., Uricar, M., Milz, S., Simon, M., Amende, K., et al. (2019). *Woodscape: A multi-task, multi-camera fisheye dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 9308â€“9318.

- For the **SynWoodScape Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Sekkat, A. R., Dupuis, Y., Kumar, V. R., Rashed, H., Yogamani, S., Vasseur, P., & Honeine, P. (2022). *SynWoodScape: Synthetic Surround-view Fisheye Camera Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets discussed in the paper.
