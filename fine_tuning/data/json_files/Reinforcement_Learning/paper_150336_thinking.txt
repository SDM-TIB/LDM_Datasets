To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning, Fast and Slow: A Goal-Directed Memory-Based Approach for Dynamic Environments" by John Chong Min Tan and Mehul Motani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical studies and mentions a "92% solve rate across 100 episodes in a dynamically changing grid world," which suggests that there may be datasets related to this environment.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (Section 6) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors describe the environment as a "2D grid world" with specific configurations (static and dynamic) but do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they seem to be using a custom environment for their experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or datasets that may have been referenced. However, it appears that the experiments are based on simulations rather than established datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that there are no datasets to extract in the traditional sense. Instead, the authors created their own environments for testing their proposed methods.

Finally, I will compile my findings. Since there are no datasets with citations to provide, I will summarize that the experiments were conducted in a custom-built 2D grid world environment, and no external datasets were utilized.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses the performance of their method in a grid world, it does not reference any external datasets, and thus there are no citations to provide.
