To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constant Stepsize Q-learning: Distributional Convergence, Bias and Extrapolation" by Yixuan Zhang and Qiaomin Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may highlight specific datasets used in the research.

2. **Identify Sections on Experiments or Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or "Experiments." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics or characteristics.

4. **Check References for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
   - **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly presented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper citations for each dataset.
