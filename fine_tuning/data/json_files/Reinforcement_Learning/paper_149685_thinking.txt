To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infinite-Horizon Reach-Avoid Zero-Sum Games via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jingqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, I will specifically check for any subsections that discuss the experiments conducted, as they typically detail the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may describe the specific datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for any explicit names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were used in the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" in their experiments, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the references, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source online if necessary.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining academic integrity and providing valuable resources for future research.
