To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Learning for Continuous Actions with Cross-Entropy Guided Policies" by Riley Simmons-Edler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention evaluating their method on several continuous control tasks in the **MuJoCo simulator** through the OpenAI Gym interface, specifically listing the tasks: **HalfCheetah-v2, Humanoid-v2, Ant-v2, Hopper-v2, and Pusher-v2**. These tasks are indicative of the datasets used for training and evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. The authors refer to the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo, which are widely recognized platforms for reinforcement learning tasks.

The relevant citations for the datasets are:

1. **OpenAI Gym**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. CoRR, abs/1606.01540. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

2. **MuJoCo**:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033. IEEE.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets identified are the tasks from the OpenAI Gym that utilize the MuJoCo physics engine for continuous control tasks.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is complete with the necessary details and citations.
