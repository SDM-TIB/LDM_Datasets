To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA: A Python Library to Benchmark Algorithmic Recourse and Counterfactual Explanation Algorithms" by Martin Pawelczyk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that CARLA provides a standardized set of integrated evaluation measures and datasets for benchmarking counterfactual explanation methods, indicating that datasets are indeed included.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset originates from the 1994 Census database and consists of 14 attributes and 48,842 instances. The classification task is to predict whether an individual has an income greater than 50,000 USD/year. Immutable features include sex, age, and race.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset contains data for over 10,000 criminal defendants in Florida and is used to score the likelihood of reoffending. The classification task is to determine if a defendant is at high risk of recidivism. Immutable features are age, sex, and race.

3. **Give Me Some Credit (GMC) Dataset**: This dataset is from a Kaggle competition and consists of 150,000 observations with 11 features. The task is to predict whether an individual will experience financial distress within the next two years. The age feature is set as immutable.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Lauren Kirchner, and ProPublica. *Machine Bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks*. 2016.

- For the **GMC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle Competition. *Give Me Some Credit. Improve on the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
