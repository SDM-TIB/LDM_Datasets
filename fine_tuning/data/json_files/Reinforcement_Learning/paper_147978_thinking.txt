To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal 3D Object Detection from Simulated Pretraining" by Asmund Brekke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset generated by the CADET tool, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for labeled data in autonomous driving and mention existing datasets like **KITTI** and **BDD100K**. This suggests that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **generated dataset section**, the authors provide detailed information about the **CADET dataset**, which consists of 10,000 samples, including 2D and 3D bounding box annotations for cars and pedestrians, along with LIDAR and camera sensor data. This section is crucial as it gives specifics about the dataset they created.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **CADET Dataset**: The dataset generated using the CADET tool, which is described in detail in the paper.
   - Citation: Brekke, A., Vatsendvik, F., & Lindseth, F. (2019). *CARLA Data Export Tool*. Retrieved from https://github.com/Ozzyz/carla-data-export/

2. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset used for various tasks in autonomous driving.
   - Citation: Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11), 1231-1237.

3. **BDD100K Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of autonomous driving.
   - Citation: Yu, F., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Liao, M., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2018). *BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
