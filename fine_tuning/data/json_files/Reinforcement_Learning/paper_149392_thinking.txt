To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chaotic fitness-dependent optimizer for planning and engineering design" by Hardi M. Mohammed and Tarik A. Rashid, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that discuss the evaluation of the proposed Chaotic Fitness Dependent Optimizer (CFDO). This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for benchmarking the algorithm's performance.

In the paper, the authors mention using **10 benchmark functions from CEC2019** to evaluate CFDO. I will look for specific names or references to these benchmark functions in the text. The authors also reference **CEC2013** and **CEC2005** benchmark functions, which are commonly used in optimization research.

I will then check the **tables** included in the paper, as they often summarize datasets or benchmark functions used in the experiments. For instance, Table 2 lists the CEC2019 benchmark functions, and I will extract the relevant details from there.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these benchmark datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:
- The original papers or sources for the CEC2019, CEC2013, and CEC2005 benchmark functions, as these are standard datasets in the optimization community.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
