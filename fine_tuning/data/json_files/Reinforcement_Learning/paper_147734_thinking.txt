To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qualitative Measurements of Policy Discrepancy for Return-Based Deep Q-Network" by Wenjia Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several representative tasks from the **OpenAI Gym** and **Atari games**, which indicates that these could be datasets or environments used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the tasks they used for their experiments, which include:

1. **CartPole**: A classic control task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Copy**: An algorithmic task where the agent must replicate a sequence of inputs.
3. **Pixelcopter**: A game-like environment where the agent controls a helicopter.
4. **Mountain Car**: A task where the agent must drive a car up a hill.
5. **Cliff Walking**: A grid-world task where the agent must navigate to a goal while avoiding falling off a cliff.
6. **Atari Games**: The paper mentions four specific games: **berzerk**, **hero**, **qbert**, and **seaquest**.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. The OpenAI Gym and Atari games are well-known, so I will use their standard citations:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **Atari games**, the citation is typically included in the OpenAI Gym reference, but I will also note that the specific games are part of the Atari Learning Environment, which can be cited as:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06730.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
