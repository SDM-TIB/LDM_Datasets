To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Fidelity Image Counterfactuals with Probabilistic Causal Models" by Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention key datasets used. In the introduction, the authors typically discuss the context and significance of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. This section often details the experimental setup and the data used for training and evaluation. I will look for any named datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of annotations).

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide additional context about how the datasets were used in their experiments, including any specific tasks or evaluations performed. This will help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide further details for each.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

Based on the content of the paper, I will likely identify several datasets, such as:

1. **Morpho-MNIST**: A dataset generated from a known causal graph for evaluating counterfactual inference methods.
   - Citation: Castro, D. C., Tan, J., Kainz, B., Konukoglu, E., & Glocker, B. (2019). Morpho-MNIST: Quantitative assessment and diagnostics for representation learning. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 20(178), 1-29.

2. **UK Biobank**: A dataset containing brain MRI scans and associated metadata.
   - Citation: Sudlow, C., Gallacher, J., Allen, N., Beral, V., Burton, P., Danesh, J., Downey, P., Elliott, P., Green, J., Landray, M., et al. (2015). UK Biobank: An open access resource for identifying the causes of a wide range of complex diseases of middle and old age. *PLoS Medicine*, 12(3), e1001779.

3. **MIMIC-CXR**: A dataset of chest X-ray images with associated free-text reports.
   - Citation: Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Berkowitz, S. J., Greenbaum, N. R., Lungren, M. P., Deng, C.-Y., Mark, R. G., & Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports. *Scientific Data*, 6(1), 1-8.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
