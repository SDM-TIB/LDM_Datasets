To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-Point Trigonometric Path Planning based on Q-Learning in Uncertain Environments" by Ehsan Jeihaninejad and Azam Rabiee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors might describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section often contains details about the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the proposed method. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **experimental results section**, I will check if the authors discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets. This could provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their significance in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will consider whether the authors used synthetic data generated from their proposed method or if they referenced any publicly available datasets indirectly. In such cases, I will note that no specific datasets were provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
