To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Internet-Scale Vision-Language Models into Embodied Agents" by Theodore Sumers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to supervise embodied agents, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using the **Playhouse environment** from Abramson et al. (2020) as part of their experimental framework. This indicates that the Playhouse environment is a dataset or a simulation used for training and testing their agents.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe various experiments. They refer to using a human-human dataset for training the original agent, which is attributed to the Interactive Agents Team (2021). This dataset is crucial for understanding the training process of the agents.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the identified datasets:

1. **Playhouse Environment**:
   - Citation:
     > Abramson, J., Ahuja, A., Barr, I., Brussee, A., Carnevale, F., Cassin, M., Chhaparia, R., Clark, S., Damoc, B., Dudzik, A., et al. *Imitating interactive intelligence*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.05672, 2020.

2. **Human-Human Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Interactive Agents Team. *Creating multimodal interactive agents with imitation and self-supervised learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.03763, 2021.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the context in which they are used within the paper. This includes noting how they contribute to the experiments and findings presented by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
