To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Lightweight, Efficient and Explainable-by-Design Convolutional Neural Network for Internet Traffic Classification" by Fuxing Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a **commercial-grade dataset** and other public benchmark datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Setting)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they describe their **commercial-grade dataset**, which is collected from four customer deployments in China, containing 9.7 million flows belonging to 200 applications/classes. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

The authors also mention the **MIRAGE dataset**, which consists of 100,000 flows belonging to 40 applications, and the **CESNET-TLS dataset**, which contains 38 million flows belonging to 191 applications. Additionally, they reference the **MNIST dataset** from computer vision, which contains 70,000 samples belonging to 10 classes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
