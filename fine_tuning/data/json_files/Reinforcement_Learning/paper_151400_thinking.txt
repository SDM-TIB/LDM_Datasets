To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Reinforcement Learning with Behavioral Supervisor Tuning" by Padmanaba Srinivasan and William Knottenbelt, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **D4RL benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **D4RL benchmark datasets**, which include various environments for offline reinforcement learning. I will look for specific datasets mentioned in the context of their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **D4RL Gym Locomotion Datasets**: This includes several environments such as HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2D, which are commonly used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

2. **D4RL Antmaze Datasets**: These datasets are designed for more complex navigation tasks and include various configurations like medium and large mazes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The D4RL benchmark is typically cited as follows:

- For the D4RL benchmark:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured correctly and ready for further processing or review.
