To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Wise Buffer Management for Incremental Object Detection: An Effective Buffer Training Strategy" by Junsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **MS COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss class incremental learning and its application to object detection, but they primarily reference the MS COCO dataset. This suggests that it is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will check for any additional datasets that may be used in conjunction with MS COCO. The authors describe their effective buffer training strategy (eBTS) and how it interacts with the datasets, but they do not mention any other datasets explicitly.

Moving to the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the results. The authors present results using the MS COCO dataset, confirming its significance in their work. They also mention various methods and their performance metrics, but again, MS COCO is the primary dataset referenced.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset based on the required format. The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the MS COCO dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
