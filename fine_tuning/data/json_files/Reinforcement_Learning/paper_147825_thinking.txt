To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Reinforcement Learning in Factored POMDPs" by Sammie Katt, Frans Oliehoek, and Christopher Amato, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the theoretical framework but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for empirical validation. In this section, the authors describe three domains where their methods were tested: **Factored Tiger**, **Collision Avoidance**, and **Gridworld**. Each of these domains represents a specific problem setup rather than traditional datasets, but they are essential for understanding the experimental context.

I will summarize the details of these domains as follows:

1. **Factored Tiger**: This domain involves an agent deciding between two doors, one hiding a tiger (danger) and the other hiding a reward (gold). The dataset here is not a traditional dataset but rather a simulation environment created for the experiments.

2. **Collision Avoidance**: This domain simulates an agent piloting a plane in a grid, avoiding obstacles. Again, this is a simulated environment rather than a dataset in the conventional sense.

3. **Gridworld**: This is a classic reinforcement learning environment where an agent navigates a grid to reach a goal. Similar to the previous domains, this is a simulation setup.

Since these domains are not traditional datasets with citations, I will check the **References section** for any related works that might provide datasets or benchmarks used in these experiments. However, the references primarily cite foundational works and methods rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I conclude that while the authors describe experimental setups, they do not reference any external datasets with full citations. Instead, they utilize simulated environments that are common in reinforcement learning research.

In summary, I will document the experimental domains as follows, noting that they are not traditional datasets but rather simulation environments used for testing the proposed methods:

- **Factored Tiger**: A simulated environment for decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Collision Avoidance**: A simulated environment for navigating obstacles in a grid.
- **Gridworld**: A classic reinforcement learning environment for navigation tasks.

Since there are no traditional datasets with citations to extract, I will note this in my final output.
