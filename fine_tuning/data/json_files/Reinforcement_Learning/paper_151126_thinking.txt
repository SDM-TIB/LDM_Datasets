To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An experimental evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for HVAC control" by Antonio Manjavacas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating DRL algorithms for HVAC control, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Data and environments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. This section outlines the building models and weather data utilized in the study. 

In **subsection 4.1 (Building models)**, the authors describe two specific building models used for testing:

1. **5ZoneAutoDXVAV**: A single-story office building model with specific dimensions and HVAC configurations.
2. **2ZoneDataCenterHVAC**: A data center model with distinct HVAC systems and configurations.

Both models are linked to specific files in the Sinergym framework, which indicates that they are part of the datasets used for the experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Weather)**, the authors mention three types of weather data integrated into Sinergym, based on Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3) data:

- **Hot dry**: Climate data corresponding to Arizona, USA.
- **Mixed humid**: Climate data for New York, USA.
- **Cool marine**: Climate data for Washington, USA.

These weather datasets are crucial for understanding the environmental conditions under which the HVAC control algorithms were tested.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The building models and weather data are likely derived from established sources or frameworks, so I will look for any references that provide the original datasets or models.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **5ZoneAutoDXVAV**, I will cite the source of the model as:
  > Wei, T., Wang, Y., Zhu, Q. (2017). *Deep reinforcement learning for building HVAC control*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference, pp. 1–6. https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062224.

- For **2ZoneDataCenterHVAC**, I will cite:
  > Ding, X., Du, W., Cerpa, A.E. (2020). *Mb2c: Model-based deep reinforcement learning for multi-zone building control*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation, pp. 50–59. https://doi.org/10.1145/3408308.3427986.

- For the **weather data**, I will reference the TMY3 data source as:
  > U.S. Department of Energy. (2021). *Prototype Building Models | Building Energy Codes Program*. https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models#Weather.

With this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
