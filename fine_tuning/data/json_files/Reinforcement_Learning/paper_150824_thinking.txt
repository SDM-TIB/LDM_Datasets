To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Sustaining Multiple Access with Continual Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Metaverse Applications" by Hamidreza Mazandarani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference existing datasets used in related work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they typically detail the datasets used for evaluation. If the paper includes a section explicitly labeled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup," that will be my primary target.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that there are no specific datasets mentioned in the sections I have read. However, the authors reference various works that may have utilized datasets relevant to their research. I will need to check the **References section** to identify any datasets that might be cited indirectly through these references.

In the references, I will look for papers that are known to provide datasets or benchmarks in the context of deep reinforcement learning or wireless communication systems. I will extract the full citations for these datasets, ensuring that I note the original papers that introduced them.

For example, if I find a reference to a dataset used in a previous study, I will include the citation for that dataset. I will also ensure to note any specific details about how the dataset was used in the context of the current research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for any mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Check the references for any datasets cited in related works.
4. Extract full citations for any identified datasets.
5. Compile the information for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
