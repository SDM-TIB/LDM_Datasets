To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Exploration and Energy-aware Path Planning via Reinforcement Learning" by Amir Niaraki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of a reinforcement learning approach for object detection and path planning in UAVs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about UAV applications but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation environment using Unreal Engine and Microsoft AirSim, which suggests that they may have used simulated data rather than publicly available datasets. However, I will continue to search for any references to specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **evaluation and results** section, the authors discuss various scenarios and experiments but do not provide specific dataset names. They mention using a simulation environment and refer to the performance of their algorithms under different wind conditions, but they do not cite any external datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of prior work or related studies. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not indicate the use of specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they relied on a simulated environment to generate the necessary data for their reinforcement learning approach.

Since no datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract in this case. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their full citations as per the requirements.

In summary, I will note that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction, and I will ensure to communicate this clearly in my final output.
