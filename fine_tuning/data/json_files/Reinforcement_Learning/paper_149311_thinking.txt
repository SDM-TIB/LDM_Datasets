To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributionally Robust Offline Model-based Policy Optimization" by Ruizhen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, I will pay close attention to sections that discuss the experimental setup, as they typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names, the number of samples, and any relevant characteristics (e.g., types of data, annotations, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "D4RL," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the references, I will search for the original papers or sources that introduced the dataset to ensure I provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
