To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AACHER: Assorted Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning with Hindsight Experience Replay" by Adarsh Sehgal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of the AACHER algorithm on various goal-based environments, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. The paper mentions five specific environments:

1. **AuboReach**: A custom-built gym environment designed for testing the AACHER algorithm with a robotic manipulator.
2. **FetchReach-v1**: An OpenAI gym environment used for robotic manipulation tasks.
3. **FetchPush-v1**: Another OpenAI gym environment for testing pushing tasks with a robotic arm.
4. **FetchSlide-v1**: An OpenAI gym environment focused on sliding tasks.
5. **FetchPickAndPlace-v1**: An OpenAI gym environment for pick-and-place tasks.

In section 4.1, the authors provide details about these environments, confirming their use in the experiments. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these environments from the references section of the paper or from external sources if necessary. The citations for the OpenAI gym environments are typically found in the original OpenAI gym documentation or related papers. 

For example, the citation for the OpenAI gym environments is:
- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. 2016. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

For the **AuboReach** environment, since it is a custom environment developed by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but can be referenced as follows:
- **AuboReach**: Custom environment developed by the authors for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
