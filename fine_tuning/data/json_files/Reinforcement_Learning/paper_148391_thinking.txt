To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robot self/other distinction: active inference meets neural networks learning in a mirror" by Pablo Lanillos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the algorithm for self-recognition in robots, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **experimental design** subsection, where the authors describe the humanoid robot TIAGo and the scenarios tested. Here, they mention that the robot was tested in front of a mirror and during robot-robot and human-robot interactions. However, they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will then examine the **experimental results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments. The authors describe two experiments: self-recognition in the mirror and self/other distinction. They mention the parameters of the Mixed Density Networks (MDN) used but do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any potential datasets that might have been used in the experiments or cited in the context of related work. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing theories and models related to self-recognition and active inference, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments, nor did they provide citations for any datasets. Instead, they focused on the algorithm and its application to the TIAGo robot.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses the experimental setup and results, it does not provide any specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries as there are none explicitly mentioned in the paper.
