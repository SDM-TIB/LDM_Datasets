To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy Preserving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Supply Chains" by Ananta Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may reference datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss a **2-player supply chain model** and mention that they conducted experiments to evaluate their proposed methods. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in the abstract or introduction. I will need to look for any references to datasets in the **methodology or results sections**.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to simulated data used for training the agents in the initial phase, but they do not provide specific names or citations for any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setup and the parameters used for the simulations.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned with citations in the paper, I will note that the authors primarily relied on simulated data for their experiments. This means I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none explicitly referenced.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:
- The paper does not reference any specific datasets by name or provide citations for them.
- The experiments were conducted using simulated data rather than publicly available datasets.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the requirement of providing full citations, which in this case, are not applicable.
