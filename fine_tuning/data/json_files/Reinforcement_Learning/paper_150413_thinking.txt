To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demystifying Causal Features on Adversarial Examples and Causal Inoculation for Robust Network by Adversarial Instrumental Variable Regression" by Junho Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss adversarial examples and their implications, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, commonly used for training machine learning models.
   
2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7:7, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
