To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vlearn: Off-Policy Learning with Efficient State-Value Function Estimation" by Fabian Otto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various continuous control tasks from **Gymnasium** and **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**. These are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather benchmark environments that provide a set of tasks for reinforcement learning algorithms.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these benchmark environments:

1. **Gymnasium**: The citation is:
   > Towers, M., Terry, J. K., Kwiatkowski, A., et al. Gymnasium. March 2023. URL https://zenodo.org/record/8127025.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**: The citation is:
   > Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., et al. DMC: Software and tasks for continuous control. Software Impacts, 6:100022, 2020. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2020.100022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each benchmark environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
