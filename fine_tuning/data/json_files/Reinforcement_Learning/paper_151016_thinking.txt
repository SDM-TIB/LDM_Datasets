To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Shortcut Learning with Diffusion Counterfactuals and Diverse Ensembles" by Luca Scimeca et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "several diversification objectives" and "synthetic counterfactuals," which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ColorDSprites**: This is a color-augmented version of the DSprites dataset, which includes symbolic objects with variations in shape, scale, orientation, and position. The authors state that they have augmented it with a color dimension, resulting in 2,862,824 distinct images.

2. **UTKFace**: This dataset contains 23,708 facial images annotated with attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity. The authors highlight its complexity and relevance for studying bias in machine learning models.

3. **CelebA**: A large-scale dataset comprising 202,599 celebrity facial images annotated with 40 different attributes, including gender and age. The authors note its diversity and challenging conditions for bias analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ColorDSprites**, the citation is:
  > Loic Matthey, Irina Higgins, Demis Hassabis, and Alexander Lerchner. *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/, 2017.

- For **UTKFace**, the citation is:
  > Z. Zhang, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
