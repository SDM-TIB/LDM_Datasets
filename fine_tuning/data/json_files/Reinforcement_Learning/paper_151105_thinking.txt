To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond PID Controllers: PPO with Neuralized PID Policy for Proton Beam Intensity Control in Mu2e" by C. Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or simulations used in the research. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference specific datasets or simulators.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section is likely to contain information about the Mu2e simulator, which is mentioned as a differentiable simulator used for generating spill data. I will note any specific datasets or simulations referenced here.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. The authors may describe the parameters of the Mu2e simulator and how it generates data for the experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper references several works, including the Mu2e simulator, which is crucial for the experiments. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for the Mu2e simulator and any other datasets mentioned.

For the Mu2e simulator, the citation is:
> Aakaash Narayanan et al. *Optimizing Mu2e Spill Regulation System Algorithms*. In Proceedings of the International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC), pages 4281â€“4284, 2021. 

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets or simulators mentioned in the references that may be relevant to the study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
