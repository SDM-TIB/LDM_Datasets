To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing method for Neural Network based on Genetic Random Weight Change Learning Algorithm" by Mohammad Ibrahim Sarker et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, proposed algorithm, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the learning behavior of the proposed algorithm was tested on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the dataset in the **results section**. Here, the authors state that they trained their proposed network with **1000 images from the MNIST dataset for handwritten character recognition**. This confirms the dataset's application in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically found in literature discussing it. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for review or further processing.
