To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCQ+: Robust and Scalable Routing with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Highly Dynamic Networks" by Saeed Kaviani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the DeepCQ+ routing protocol but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets are described. I will look for any references to specific datasets used for training or testing the DeepCQ+ protocol. If the authors mention any simulation environments or datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention developing an OpenAI gym environment for training their DeepCQ+ agents. However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets that are commonly used in the field. Instead, they refer to various mobility models and scenarios that they have created for their simulations.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any works that might describe datasets or environments used in similar studies. The references include various papers on MANETs and routing protocols, but they do not provide specific datasets either.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environment**: The authors developed a custom environment for training their DeepCQ+ agents, but no specific datasets are mentioned.
2. **Mobility Models**: The paper discusses using mobility models like Gauss-Markov and random way-point for simulating network scenarios, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any specific datasets for extraction. If I were to summarize the findings, I would note the absence of explicit datasets and the reliance on custom simulation environments instead.

In this case, I will not create any dataset entries, as there are no datasets with full citations to include.
