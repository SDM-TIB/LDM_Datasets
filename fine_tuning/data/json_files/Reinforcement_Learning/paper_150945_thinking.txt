To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Resource Management for Edge Network Slicing using Incremental Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Haiyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm through simulations, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. If there is no specific section, I will check the **figures and tables** for any references to datasets used in the simulations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **simulated edge computing network** for their experiments, but they do not provide specific datasets from real-world sources. Instead, they describe the parameters and configurations of their simulation environment, such as the number of servers, computing resources, and bandwidth capacities.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors rely on a simulated environment rather than publicly available datasets. However, I will still check the **References section** for any relevant citations that might pertain to the simulation framework or methodologies used.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to resource management and network slicing, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. 

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their experiments. Instead, they conducted simulations based on their own configurations. Therefore, I will document this finding, noting the absence of datasets and the reliance on a simulated environment for the research.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the use of simulations in the context of the research.
