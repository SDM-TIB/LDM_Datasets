To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PFPN: Continuous Control of Physically Simulated Characters using Particle Filtering Policy Network" by Pei Xu and Ioannis Karamouzas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on benchmarks from the **DeepMimic framework**. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved in their experiments.

In section 4.1 (Setup), the authors describe the characters used in their experiments, specifically a humanoid and a dog character, and mention that they run benchmarks based on the **DeepMimic framework**. This framework is known for its use of motion capture data for training physics-based character control.

I will then look for any specific references to datasets within the text. The authors do not provide explicit dataset names in the main body of the paper, but they do refer to the **DeepMimic framework** as the source of their motion capture data.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any relevant citations related to the DeepMimic framework. The relevant citation for the DeepMimic framework is:

- For **DeepMimic**:
  > Xue Bin Peng, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, and Michiel van de Panne. *DeepMimic: Example-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning of Physics-Based Character Skills*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 37(4):1â€“14, 2018.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset used in the experiments.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify datasets.
3. Confirm the dataset by checking the references for the DeepMimic framework citation.

This process ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
