To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Average Margin Regularization for Classifiers" by Matt Olfat and Anil Aswani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of both synthetic and real data for empirical validation, which indicates that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify their names. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss using synthetic data and the MNIST dataset for their experiments. I will need to extract details about these datasets.

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe how they generated synthetic data for their experiments, but they do not provide a formal citation since it is generated data. I will note that this dataset is created for the purpose of the study and does not have a formal citation.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. The authors mention using it in their experiments. I will need to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges, “MNIST hand-written digit database,” AT&T Labs, 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Since the synthetic data does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is generated data specific to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:

- **Synthetic Data**: Generated for the purpose of the study (no formal citation).
- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges, “MNIST hand-written digit database,” AT&T Labs, 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

With this information, I will be ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing.
