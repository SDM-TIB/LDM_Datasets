To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence of SARSA with Linear Function Approximation: The Random Horizon Case" by Lina Palmborg, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of data sources or datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I may need to conduct additional searches to find the original sources of the datasets mentioned. This could involve looking up the dataset names in academic databases or repositories.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Conduct additional searches if necessary to find original sources.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
