To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alpha Elimination: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to Reduce Fill-In during Sparse Matrix Decomposition" by Arpan Dasgupta and Pawan Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the problem of fill-in during LU decomposition, which may imply the use of specific matrices for experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on matrices from the **SuiteSparse Matrix Collection**. This is a significant clue indicating that this collection is a dataset used in their research.

In **Table 1**, the authors list various matrices used for testing, which include:

1. **west0479**: A matrix related to chemical process simulation.
2. **mbeause**: An economic problem matrix.
3. **tomography**: A matrix used in computer graphics/vision problems.
4. **Trefethen_500**: A combinatorial problem matrix.
5. **olm500**: A matrix related to computational fluid dynamics.
6. **Erdos991**: An undirected graph matrix.
7. **rbsb480**: A robotics problem matrix.
8. **ex27**: Another computational fluid dynamics matrix.
9. **m_t1**: A structural problem matrix.
10. **Emilia_923**: A matrix for model reduction problems.
11. **tx2010**: A 2D/3D problem matrix.
12. **boneS10**: A matrix related to computer graphics/vision.
13. **PFlow_742**: A matrix for fluid dynamics.
14. **Hardesty1**: Another structural problem matrix.
15. **vas_stokes_4M**: A semiconductor process problem matrix.
16. **stokes**: Another semiconductor process problem matrix.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SuiteSparse Matrix Collection**. The relevant citation is:

> Kolodziej, S.P., Aznaveh, M., Bullock, M., David, J., Davis, T.A., Henderson, M., Hu, Y., Sandstrom, R. "The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection website interface." *Journal of Open Source Software* 4(35), 1244 (2019).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The datasets extracted are primarily from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, which is a well-known repository of sparse matrices used for various computational problems.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
