To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Q-Learning for Combinatorial Optimization" by Victoria M. Dax et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will check if any datasets are mentioned there. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context of their work. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced or implied as being used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4 (Method)**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets used for training or testing their model. The authors may describe how they generated or sourced their data, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

I will also examine the **experimental results section** to see if the authors provide any details about the datasets used in their experiments, including any performance metrics or comparisons with other methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for specific datasets related to combinatorial optimization problems, particularly those used in the context of flexible job shop scheduling (FJSP) or similar tasks. If the authors mention any benchmark datasets or specific instances they created, I will document those.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format for downstream processing or review.
