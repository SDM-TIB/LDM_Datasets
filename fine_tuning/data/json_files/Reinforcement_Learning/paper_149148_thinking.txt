To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Language Navigation with Random Environmental Mixup" by Chong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract highlights the challenges in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) and mentions the use of benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset as a widely used benchmark for VLN tasks. This indicates that the R2R dataset is likely one of the primary datasets used in their experiments.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (section 5) to find detailed mentions of datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their agent on the **Room-to-Room (R2R)** dataset and the **R4R** dataset. The R4R dataset is an extension of the R2R dataset, designed to provide a more challenging setting for embodied navigation agents.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Room-to-Room (R2R) Dataset**:
   > Anderson, P., Wu, Q., Teney, D., Bruce, J., Johnson, M., Sunderhauf, N., Reid, I., Gould, S., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2018). Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments. In CVPR.

2. **R4R Dataset**:
   > Jain, V., Magalhaes, G., Ku, A., Vaswani, A., Ie, E., & Baldridge, J. (2019). Stay on the path: Instruction fidelity in vision-and-language navigation. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
