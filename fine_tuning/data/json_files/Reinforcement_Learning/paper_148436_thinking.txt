To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automating Turbulence Modeling by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Guido Novatia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for turbulence modeling, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to dig deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, which often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they performed Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) on a uniform grid of size 512³ for a periodic cubic domain. This indicates that DNS data is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **results and discussion sections**. The authors discuss the statistical properties of the turbulence simulations and compare their results with DNS data, which reinforces the importance of this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DNS dataset. The authors refer to the DNS data as being produced with a specific solver and mention that the simulations were based on the work of Rogallo and Moin. The relevant citation is:

- For **Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)**:
  > RS Rogallo, P Moin. *Numerical simulation of turbulent flows*. Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 16, 99–137 (1984).

Additionally, the authors mention using Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in their methodology, but they do not provide a specific dataset for LES in the same way they do for DNS. Instead, they describe the methodology for generating LES data based on the DNS data.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the DNS dataset, which is crucial for the validation of the turbulence models developed using MARL. I will document this dataset with its full citation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the DNS dataset based on the information gathered.
