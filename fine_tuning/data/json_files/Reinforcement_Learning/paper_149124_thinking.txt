To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Provably-Efficient Model-Free Algorithm for Constrained Markov Decision Processes" by Honghao Wei, Xin Liu, and Lei Ying, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that the authors utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to a specific benchmark called the **Dynamic Gym benchmark** in the evaluation section. This indicates that they used this dataset for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this benchmark.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Dynamic Gym benchmark**. The citation is crucial for proper documentation and should include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering the information, I will compile the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dynamic Gym benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed algorithm in environments with continuous state and action spaces. The authors mention that it is generated using safety-gym, which is a relevant detail.

Next, I will look for the citation for the **Dynamic Gym benchmark** in the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Yang, Q., Sim√£o, T. D., Tindemans, S. H., & Spaan, M. T. J. (2021). WCSAC: Worst-case soft actor critic for safety-constrained reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. AAAI Press.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.

In conclusion, I will document the dataset entry for the **Dynamic Gym benchmark** with its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
