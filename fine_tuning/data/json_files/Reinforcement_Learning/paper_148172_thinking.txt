To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Continuation with Hindsight Inverse Dynamics" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and tasks, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the datasets' characteristics.

In **Section 4.1 (GridWorld Navigation)**, the authors mention using the **GridWorld environment** for their experiments. They describe it as a navigation task with a specific setup, but I need to check if they provide a formal citation for this dataset or environment.

In **Section 4.2 (OpenAI Fetch Env)**, the authors discuss several tasks based on the **Fetch robotics arm**, specifically mentioning **FetchReach, FetchPush, FetchSlide, and FetchPickAndPlace**. Each of these tasks is associated with a specific environment, and I will need to confirm if there are citations for these environments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. For example, the authors reference the Fetch environments as being provided by Plappert et al. (2018). The citation I need to extract is:
> Matthias Plappert, Marcin Andrychowicz, Alex Ray, Bob McGrew, Bowen Baker, Glenn Powell, Jonas Schneider, Josh Tobin, Maciek Chociej, Peter Welinder, et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

For the **GridWorld environment**, if no specific citation is provided in the paper, I will note that it is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning literature, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation unless one is given.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned in the paper. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
