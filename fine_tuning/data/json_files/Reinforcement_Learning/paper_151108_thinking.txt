To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Generative Symbolic Regression" by Samuel Holt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets. This could include sections titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the identified sections, I will extract relevant information about each dataset, including:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics (e.g., number of variables, types of data).
   - Any specific configurations or conditions under which the dataset was used.

4. **Check the References Section**: After gathering information about the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A concise summary of the dataset's purpose and characteristics.
   - **Citation**: The full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
