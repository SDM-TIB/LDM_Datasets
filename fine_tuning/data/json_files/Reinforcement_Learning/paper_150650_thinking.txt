To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulating Counterfactuals" by Juha Karvanen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on counterfactual inference and fairness analysis, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the relevance of counterfactual questions and fairness in prediction models, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Moving on to the **methodology and algorithms sections**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. The authors describe their algorithm for simulating counterfactual distributions and mention its application in fairness evaluation, particularly in credit-scoring scenarios. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in these sections.

In the **application section**, the authors describe a credit-scoring example and mention using a synthetic dataset based on a structural causal model (SCM). They refer to the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset as a basis for their simulations. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates a specific dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Hofmann, H. (1994). Statlog (German Credit Data). UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C5NC77.

Since the paper primarily discusses a synthetic dataset based on the SCM and does not provide additional datasets, I will summarize my findings.

The only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset, which is used as a reference for the credit-scoring example.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
