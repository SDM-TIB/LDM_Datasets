To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations via Latent Space Projection and Interpolation" by Brian Barr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on three datasets: **MNIST**, **UCI credit dataset**, and **Lending Club**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the datasets again. They specifically state that they demonstrate their framework on **MNIST** for its visual appeal and on two tabular datasets: the **UCI credit dataset** and **Lending Club**. This confirms that these three datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in the context of the experiments, where the authors provide details about each dataset's characteristics and relevance to their method.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and is often used in machine learning for benchmarking. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann Lecun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, pages 2278–2324, 1998.

2. **UCI Credit Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic, billing, and payment information related to credit card defaults. The citation for the UCI credit dataset is:
   > I-Cheng Yeh and Che hui Lien. *The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients*. Expert Systems with Applications, 36(2, Part 1):2473–2480, 2009.

3. **Lending Club Dataset**: This dataset includes information on borrowers and their loan defaults. The citation for the Lending Club dataset is:
   > Nathan George. *All lending club loan data*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club, 2018.

After gathering the necessary information about each dataset, I will ensure that I have the full citations ready for each dataset. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
