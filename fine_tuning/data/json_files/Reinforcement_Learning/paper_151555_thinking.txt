To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Service Placement in Fog Computing Leveraging Infrastructure Nodes for Optimization" by Carlos Guerrero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a benchmark case using the NSGA-II algorithm for optimizing fog service placement, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this optimization problem.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the benchmark problem for the resource optimization as the fog application placement problem (FAPP). They mention that the optimization involves a set of applications and computational nodes, but I need to find explicit dataset names or references.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are references to previous works that might have used specific datasets. This could provide additional context or direct citations for datasets that are relevant to the study.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in their experiments, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references section.

If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will summarize the types of data used (e.g., application instances, resource consumption metrics) and note that these are derived from the authors' experiments rather than from publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources as required by the task.
