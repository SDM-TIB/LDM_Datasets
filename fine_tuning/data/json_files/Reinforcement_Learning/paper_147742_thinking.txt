To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Attention Mining for Weakly Supervised Thoracic Disease Pattern Localization in Chest X-Rays" by Jinzheng Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on the **ChestX-ray14 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the **introduction**, the authors emphasize the importance of the ChestX-ray14 dataset, stating it is large-scale and provides image-level labels. This confirms that this dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed information about the **ChestX-ray14 dataset**, including the number of images and the types of diseases represented. They mention that the dataset contains 51,709 images of subjects with thoracic diseases and 60,412 images without, along with 880 images marked with bounding boxes corresponding to 984 disease patterns across 8 types.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ChestX-ray14 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ChestX-ray14 dataset**:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ChestX-ray14 dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
