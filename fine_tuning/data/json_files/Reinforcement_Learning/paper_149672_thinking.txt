To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistically Robust Recourse: Navigating the Trade-Offs Between Costs and Robustness in Algorithmic Recourse" by Martin Pawelczyk et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental evaluations with multiple real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset originates from the 1994 Census database and consists of 14 attributes and 48,842 instances. The class label indicates whether an individual has an income greater than 50,000 USD/year.

2. **Give Me Some Credit (GMC) Dataset**: This dataset is a credit scoring dataset consisting of 150,000 observations and 11 features. The class label indicates if the corresponding individual will experience financial distress within the next two years.

3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset contains data for more than 10,000 criminal defendants in Florida and is used to score defendants' likelihood of re-offending. The class label indicates if the corresponding defendant is high or low risk for recidivism.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **GMC Dataset**:
  > Kaggle-Competition. (2011). "Give Me Some Credit" dataset.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals, and it’s biased against blacks.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
