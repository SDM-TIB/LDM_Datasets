To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Training in Pommerman with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning" by Hardik Meisheri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions the Pommerman simulation, it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the challenges of reinforcement learning in multi-agent environments but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology and experimentation sections**, I will look for any specific datasets used in the training of the agents. The paper describes the training setup and mentions that the agents were trained against various opponents, but it does not explicitly list any datasets.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. However, it appears that the focus is more on methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references include various papers related to reinforcement learning and the Pommerman environment, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they focused on the Pommerman environment itself as the primary context for their research.

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract and cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their full citations as per the requirements.

In summary, I will note that the paper does not provide explicit datasets for extraction, and therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile.
