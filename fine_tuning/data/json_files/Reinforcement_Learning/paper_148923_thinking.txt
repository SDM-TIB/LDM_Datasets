To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling SARS-CoV-2 coevolution with genetic algorithms" by Aymeric Vi√©, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on data availability or datasets**. In this paper, there is a section titled **"Data and code availability"** (Section 7), which is likely to contain information about the datasets used in the study. I will carefully examine this section for any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **"Data and code availability"** section, the author mentions that the main simulation code is available on GitHub, but I need to check if any datasets are explicitly listed. If the datasets are not directly mentioned, I will look for references to external datasets or studies that provide the necessary data.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in the research. This is crucial as datasets often originate from previous studies, and proper citation is necessary.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper references a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to include the complete citation as it appears in the references section.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on proper citation and clarity.
