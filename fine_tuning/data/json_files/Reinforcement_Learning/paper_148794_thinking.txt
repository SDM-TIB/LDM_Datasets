To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Cost Management in Smart Meters Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Mohammadhadi Shateri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions empirical results evaluated on actual smart meter data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, specifically subsection IV.A, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **electricity consumption and occupancy (ECO) dataset** published by another source. This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for the details of this dataset, which are provided in the same subsection. The authors describe the ECO dataset as containing 1 Hz electricity usage measured by smart meters and occupancy labels gathered through a tablet computer and a passive infrared sensor. They also mention that the dataset is sampled with a sampling rate of 15 minutes and consists of 2700 samples, which are split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ECO dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For the **ECO dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Beckel, W. Kleiminger, R. Cicchetti, T. Staake, and S. Santini. *The eco data set and the performance of non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Embedded Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, pages 80â€“89, ACM, 2014.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry with its full citation. This ensures that I have accurately documented the dataset used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for downstream processing or review.
