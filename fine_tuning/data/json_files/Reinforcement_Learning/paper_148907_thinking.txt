To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Rational Activations to Boost Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Quentin Delfosse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for specific references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their findings. If the authors mention any datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any subsections specifically titled "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to reinforcement learning, particularly those used in the context of Atari games, as mentioned in the experiments. The authors may refer to datasets like the **Atari 2600 games** or any other relevant datasets they used for training and evaluation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations. For example, if the authors used the Atari 2600 games, I would note that down and find the appropriate citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset with its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
