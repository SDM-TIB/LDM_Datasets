To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Agent Optimization Through Policy Iteration Using Monte-Carlo Tree Search" by Arta Seify and Michael Buro, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors gauge the effectiveness of their method in "SameGame," which suggests that this game may be a dataset or a test domain.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments using the "SameGame" domain, which is a tile-matching game. I need to determine if "SameGame" is treated as a dataset or if there are other datasets referenced.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors provide details about the game mechanics and the parameters used for training, but they do not explicitly mention additional datasets. However, they refer to "public test positions" used for benchmarking, which may imply the existence of a dataset or collection of test cases.

I will then check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to "SameGame" or the public test positions. If "SameGame" is a well-known dataset or benchmark, it may have a formal citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that "SameGame" is indeed a recognized problem in the literature, but it is not attributed to a single dataset with a formal citation. Instead, it is commonly referenced in the context of various studies on optimization and search algorithms.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation for "SameGame," I will note that it is a widely used benchmark in the field, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation as I would for a traditional dataset.

In summary, the key dataset I will extract from this paper is:

1. **SameGame**: A tile-matching game used as a test domain for evaluating the proposed algorithms. While it is not formally cited as a dataset, it is a well-known benchmark in the field.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
