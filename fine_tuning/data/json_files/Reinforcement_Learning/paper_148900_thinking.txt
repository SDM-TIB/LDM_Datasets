To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence Loss Training for Spoken Language Understanding" by Milind Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate improvements on "open SLU datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, the authors list several datasets:

1. **Fluent Speech Dataset**: A public dataset containing 23,000 utterances (15 hours) processed for intent and named-entity recognition, with 10 intents and 2 slots.

2. **18 Intent Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 5.6 million utterances (3,300 hours) covering 18 intents related to home automation, global, and notifications, with 40 slots.

3. **More Intent Dataset**: A larger dataset with 22 million utterances (16,000 hours) that spans across 64 intents and 122 slots.

4. **ASR-only Dataset**: A dataset containing 23,000 hours of audio used for pretraining the ASR model.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly within the text, so I will need to rely on the context provided in the paper and any known sources for these datasets.

For the **Fluent Speech Dataset**, I can reference:
> Loren Lugosch, Mirco Ravanelli, Patrick Ignoto, Vikrant Singh Tomar, and Yoshua Bengio. "Speech model pre-training for end-to-end spoken language understanding." arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.03670, 2019.

For the **18 Intent Dataset** and **More Intent Dataset**, the paper does not provide specific citations, but they are likely proprietary datasets developed by the authors or their organization (Amazon Alexa). Therefore, I will note them as internal datasets without formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Fluent Speech Dataset and noting the other datasets as internal without citations. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
