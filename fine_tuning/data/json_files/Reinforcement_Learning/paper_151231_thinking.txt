To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Texture Bias of Deep Neural Networks via Edge Enhancing Diffusion" by Edgar Heinert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize data from the **Cityscapes dataset** and the **CARLA driving simulator** for their experiments, which suggests that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about the datasets. The introduction mentions the use of EED-processed images derived from these datasets, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, I will look for a subsection dedicated to datasets. Here, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Cityscapes dataset** and **CARLA driving simulator**. They provide details about the number of images and how they are used for training and evaluation. 

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The authors mention using 2975 finely labeled training images and 500 validation images, which are part of the Cityscapes dataset. This dataset contains street scene images of German urban environments, labeled with semantic segmentation masks.

2. **CARLA Dataset**: The authors also use 4000 images from the CARLA driving simulator, with 3000 images for training and 1000 for testing. They note that semantic segmentation masks are available for these images as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Scharwächter, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset*. In CVPR Workshop on the Future of Datasets in Vision, volume 2, 2015.

- For the **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16. PMLR, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Used for semantic segmentation with 2975 training images and 500 validation images.
   - Citation: Marius Cordts et al. (2015).

2. **CARLA Dataset**: Used for semantic segmentation with 3000 training images and 1000 test images.
   - Citation: Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. (2017).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
