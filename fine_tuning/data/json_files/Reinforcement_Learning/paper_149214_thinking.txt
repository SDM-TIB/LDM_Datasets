To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning based Dynamic Optimization of Bus Timetable" by Guanqun Ai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section V), where the authors discuss the application of their method (DRL-TO) on three real-world bus lines. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the paper, the authors mention using real-world swiping data obtained from three live bus lines (2, 230, and 239) in Xiamen City on June 15, 2018. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of stations, service times, and passenger counts for each line.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset:

1. **Bus Line 2**: 
   - Direction: Up and Down
   - Service Time: 6:20-22:00 (Up), 6:30-22:00 (Down)
   - Stations: 37
   - Passengers: 4968 (Up), 4515 (Down)

2. **Bus Line 230**: 
   - Direction: Up and Down
   - Service Time: 6:00-22:00 (Up), 6:45-22:00 (Down)
   - Stations: 36
   - Passengers: 7739 (Up), 6818 (Down)

3. **Bus Line 239**: 
   - Direction: Up and Down
   - Service Time: 6:00-23:05 (Up), 6:40-23:40 (Down)
   - Stations: 35
   - Passengers: 5896 (Up), 5802 (Down)

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors may have cited previous works that describe the datasets or the methods used to collect the data.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets. If the datasets are original to this study, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its characteristics and citation information, ready for further processing or review.
