To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Expected Emphatic Traces for Deep RL" by Ray Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions testing the approach on **Atari 2600 video games**, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these games.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on a widely used deep reinforcement learning benchmark, specifically the **Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment**. This indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is the **Arcade Learning Environment** dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Atari games and does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **Arcade Learning Environment** is the only dataset referenced in this paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
