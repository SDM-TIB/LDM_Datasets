To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization of Project Scheduling Activities in Dynamic CPM and PERT Networks Using Genetic Algorithms" by M. Hanefi Calp and M. Ali Akcayol, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or prior studies that utilized datasets relevant to their research. This section often contains background information that can lead to the identification of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for testing or validation of the proposed genetic algorithm. The authors may describe the data they used to evaluate their algorithm's performance.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors present any data or findings that reference specific datasets. This section may include tables or figures that summarize the results obtained from the datasets.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that may contain additional information about the data used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Throughout this process, I will ensure that I accurately capture the names and details of the datasets, as well as their citations, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide proper credit to the original sources.
