To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEED RL: Scalable and Efficient Deep-RL with Accelerated Central Inference" by Lasse Espeholt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the SEED agent is evaluated on **Atari-57, DeepMind Lab, and Google Research Football**, indicating that these are the datasets or environments involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets are utilized. In section 4.1, the authors discuss the **DeepMind Lab**, which is a 3D environment based on the Quake 3 engine, and they evaluate on four commonly used tasks. This confirms that DeepMind Lab is indeed a dataset/environment used in their experiments.

In section 4.2, the authors mention **Google Research Football**, which is described as an environment similar to FIFA video games. This section provides details about the tasks and hyperparameters used, confirming its role as a dataset/environment.

In section 4.3, the authors discuss the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, specifically mentioning the evaluation of their implementation of R2D2 on 57 Atari 2600 games. This indicates that ALE is another dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each of these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **DeepMind Lab**:

Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, Julian Schrittwieser, Keith Anderson, Sarah York, Max Cant, Adam Cain, Adrian Bolton, Stephen Gaffney, Helen King, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Stig Petersen. *DeepMind Lab*.

2. **Google Research Football**:

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.
