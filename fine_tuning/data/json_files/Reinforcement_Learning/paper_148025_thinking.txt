To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-conditioned Imitation Learning" by Yiming Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the tasks and environments used for their evaluations. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets or environments that were utilized in their experiments.

In section 5.1 (Tasks), the authors mention four continuous environments used for testing their algorithm: 

1. **Four Rooms Environment**: A continuous task where a point mass is placed in an environment with four rooms connected through small openings.
2. **Pointmass Block Pusher**: A task where a point mass navigates to a block, pushes it to a desired position, and stops at a potentially different spot.
3. **Fetch Pick and Place**: A task where a fetch robot picks a block and places it at a desired point in space.
4. **Fetch Stack Two**: A task where a fetch robot stacks two blocks at a desired position.

These environments are described in detail, but they do not refer to external datasets. Instead, they are simulated environments created for the purpose of the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the environments or tasks are based on existing datasets or if they reference any foundational work that might have datasets associated with it. However, it appears that the environments are custom setups rather than datasets that can be cited.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with formal citations, I will note that the environments are simulated and do not correspond to publicly available datasets. 

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper describes several environments used for experimentation, it does not cite any external datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

In conclusion, I will document the environments used in the experiments but clarify that they are not datasets in the traditional sense and do not have formal citations associated with them.
