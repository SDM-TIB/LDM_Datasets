To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Control-Aware Prediction Objectives for Autonomous Driving" by Rowan McAllister et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CARLA simulator for experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this simulator.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their methodology and the scenarios they implemented. They mention using the **CARLA simulator** for pedestrian trajectory prediction, which indicates that the CARLA dataset is relevant.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or cited. The references may provide full citations for datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors specifically mention the **Oracle distribution** and **R2P2** as methods for simulating pedestrian behavior. However, they do not provide specific datasets for these methods, as they are more about the algorithms used rather than datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **CARLA Simulator**: The CARLA simulator is mentioned as the platform used for the experiments. The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
   > Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In: Conference on robot learning. PMLR. 2017, pp. 1â€“16.

2. **R2P2**: While R2P2 is a method rather than a dataset, it is important to note that it is based on the likelihood-based multi-agent prediction algorithm. The citation for R2P2 is:
   > Nicholas Rhinehart, Kris Kitani, and Paul Vernaza. "R2P2: A ReparameteRized Pushforward Policy for Diverse, Precise Generative Path Forecasting." In: European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review. This will include confirming that I have the correct titles, authors, and publication details for each dataset.
