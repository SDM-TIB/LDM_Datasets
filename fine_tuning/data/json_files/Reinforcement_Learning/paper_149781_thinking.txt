To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning for Context-Dependent Decision-Making" by Yuzhen Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail, including any specific tasks or benchmarks they are evaluating. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that may summarize dataset characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide insights into how they applied their algorithms to specific datasets. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named and described, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST)** as a dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Buchsbaum, B. R., Greer, S., Chang, W.-L., & Berman, K. F. (2005). Meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Task and component processes. *Human Brain Mapping*, 25(1), 35-45.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
