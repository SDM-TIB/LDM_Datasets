To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Fourier View of REINFORCE" by Adeel Pervez, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically discussed.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The paper mentions two datasets: **MNIST** and **Omniglot**. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, specifically that they are employed for generative modeling with sigmoid belief networks.

Next, I will check the **tables** presented in the experiments section, which provide training ELBO results for both datasets. This confirms their usage in the experiments and provides additional context about their application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. While the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, I can reference the original sources for MNIST and Omniglot:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **Omniglot dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lake, Brenden M., et al. "One-shot learning of simple visual concepts." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 113.15 (2016): 4296-4301.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or downstream processing.
