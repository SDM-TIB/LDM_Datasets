To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value-Based Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control Robotic Manipulation in Multi-Task Sparse Reward Settings" by Sreehari Rammohan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of RBF-DQN on robotic manipulation tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention using RLBench for evaluating their method. This indicates that RLBench is a dataset or benchmark used in their experiments.

In the **technical approach section**, the authors provide a detailed description of RLBench, stating that it is a robot learning simulator with various tasks. This section confirms that RLBench is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific tasks mentioned in the paper that may correspond to different datasets or subsets of datasets. The authors list five tasks: Fetch Reach, Button Push, Toilet Down, Open Drawer, and Pick and Place. While these tasks are part of the RLBench dataset, they are important to note as they represent specific scenarios within the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RLBench dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **RLBench**, the citation is:
  > Stephen James, Zicong Ma, David Rovick Arrojo, and Andrew J. Davison. *RLBench: The Robot Learning Benchmark & Learning Environment*. arXiv e-prints, art. arXiv:1909.12271, September 2019.

Since RLBench is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and full citation for future reference or processing.
