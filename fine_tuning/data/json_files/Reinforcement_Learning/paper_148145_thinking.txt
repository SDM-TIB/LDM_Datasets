To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantile QT-Opt for Risk-Aware Vision-Based Robotic Grasping" by Cristian Bodnar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in simulated and real vision-based robotic grasping tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section IV (Quantile QT-Opt)** and **section V (Results)**. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a **72 TiB dataset of real-world experiences** collected over five months, which contains **559,642 episodes** of robotic grasping tasks. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed methods.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to previous works that may have introduced or utilized datasets relevant to their research.

For the dataset mentioned, I will compile the following information:

1. **Real-World Dataset**: This dataset consists of experiences collected from robotic grasping tasks, which is essential for training the proposed models. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be a collection of their own experiments.

2. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors also mention using simulated environments for training, but they do not specify a particular dataset name. Instead, they describe the setup and parameters used for generating the simulated data.

Now, I will ensure to write down the full citation for the dataset that is referenced in the paper. Since the real-world dataset is not attributed to a specific paper, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for any referenced datasets.

In conclusion, I will document the following datasets:

- **Real-World Dataset**: Internal dataset of robotic grasping experiences (no specific citation).
- **Simulated Dataset**: Generated through the authors' experimental setup (no specific citation).

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing the necessary citations where applicable.
