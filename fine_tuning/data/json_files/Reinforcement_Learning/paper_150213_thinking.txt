To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The GA-cal software for the automatic calibration of soil constitutive laws: a tutorial and a user manual" by Francisco J. Mendez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the software and its application, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the calibration process.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the calibration of the Sand Hypoplastic law using experimental data from oedometer and triaxial drained tests. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the calibration procedure. They mention using experimental data from two types of tests: **oedometer tests** and **triaxial drained tests**. I will look for any specific references to datasets or sources of these experimental data.

In the **input files section**, the authors detail the required input files for the GA-cal software. They mention:
1. **OE data.txt**: Contains experimental data from the oedometer tests, including void ratio, vertical stress, and test identification numbers.
2. **TD data.txt**: Contains experimental data from the triaxial drained tests, including axial deformation, volumetric deformation, deviatoric stress, and test identification numbers.

These files are crucial as they contain the actual datasets used for calibration.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the original work on the Sand Hypoplastic law by von Wolffersdorff, which is essential for citing the datasets correctly.

The citations I need to include are:
- For the Sand Hypoplastic law:
  > P.-A. von Wolffersdorff. *A hypoplastic relation for granular materials with a predefined limit state surface*. Mechanics of Cohesive-frictional Materials, 1(3):251â€“271, 1996.

Additionally, I will note that the experimental data used in the paper is derived from the works referenced in the methodology, particularly those that describe the oedometer and triaxial tests.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
