To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Re-ranking with 2D Grid-based Recommendation Panels" by Xiao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions experiments conducted on a dataset collected from an e-commerce app, it does not specify the dataset's name or details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of presenting recommendations in a 2D grid format but do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they do mention that their experiments are based on a dataset collected from a popular e-commerce app, which indicates that a dataset is indeed used.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they conducted experiments on a dataset collected from a popular e-commerce app in October 2021, which contains 20,000 user requests for training and 1,000 for testing. However, the dataset is not given a specific name, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Since the dataset is not named in the paper, I will need to note this as a limitation. The authors do not provide a reference to a publicly available dataset or any specific citation for the dataset used in their experiments. Therefore, I will document the dataset as "E-commerce App Dataset" and include a description based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to reference the source of the dataset information.

The citation for the paper is:

In Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in the Asia Pacific Region (SIGIR-AP ’23), November 26–28, 2023, Beijing, China. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 6 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3624918.3625311

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: E-commerce App Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset collected from a popular e-commerce app in October 2021, containing 20,000 user requests for training and 1,000 for testing.
- **Citation**: Include the full citation of the paper as provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
