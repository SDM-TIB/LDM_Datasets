To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Q-Learning with Reference-Advantage Decomposition: Almost Optimal Regret and Logarithmic Communication Cost" by Zhong Zheng, Haochen Zhang, and Lingzhou Xue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. Authors often discuss the datasets in the context of their findings, which can provide valuable information.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citations for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets and provide their full citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and citations into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Check results and discussion sections for additional dataset references.
4. Note down full citations from the References section for each dataset identified.
5. Compile the information in a structured format for clarity and ease of use.
