To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Autonomous Vehicles from Behavior Analysis" by Fabio Maresca et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset called **NexusStreet** using the CARLA simulator, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for a dataset that combines autonomous and human driving scenes. They mention that the dataset is publicly available on Zenodo, which is crucial for citation purposes.

In the **dataset generation section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset. The authors describe how they collected data using the CARLA simulator and the Baidu Apollo autonomous driving agent, as well as the manual driving data collected with a Logitech G29 steering wheel. They specify that the dataset consists of 520 scenes, with a mix of autonomous and human-driven scenarios.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the NexusStreet dataset was used for their experiments, which will validate its significance in the research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the NexusStreet dataset. The authors mention that it is publicly available on Zenodo at the URL: https://zenodo.org/records/7682484. I will format the citation accordingly.

The citation for the NexusStreet dataset is:
> Fabio Maresca, Filippo Grazioli, Antonio Albanese, Vincenzo Sciancalepore, Gianpiero Negri, Xavier Costa-Perez. *NexusStreet: A Dataset for Detecting Autonomous Vehicles from Behavior Analysis*. Zenodo, 2024. Available at: https://zenodo.org/records/7682484.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
