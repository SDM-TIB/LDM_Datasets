To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Diversity of Bootstrapped DQN by Replacing Priors with Noise" by Li Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the experiments conducted on the **Atari benchmark**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Atari games used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses reinforcement learning and the Bootstrapped DQN algorithm but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to the **method** section, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention conducting experiments across **49 Atari games on the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**. This indicates that the dataset consists of various Atari games, but I need to confirm the exact nature of this dataset.

In the **experimental details** section, the authors specify that they conducted experiments on the **Atari benchmark**, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning research. However, they do not provide a detailed citation for this dataset.

I will then check the **results** section to see if there are any additional details about the datasets used. The results primarily focus on the performance metrics of the algorithms tested on the Atari games, but they do not provide further information about the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the Atari benchmark. The Atari dataset is widely recognized in the field, and I can provide a standard citation for it:

- For the **Atari benchmark**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Mnih. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. The key dataset extracted from the paper is the Atari benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted in this research.
