To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IDQL: Implicit Q-Learning as an Actor-Critic Method with Diffusion Policies" by Philippe Hansen-Estruch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this case, I will check **section 6 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments.

Upon reviewing section 6, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation, specifically in the context of offline reinforcement learning benchmarks. The datasets listed include:

1. **D4RL locomotion datasets**: These datasets include:
   - **halfcheetah-medium-v2**
   - **hopper-medium-v2**
   - **walker2d-medium-v2**
   - **halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2**
   - **hopper-medium-replay-v2**
   - **walker2d-medium-replay-v2**
   - **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**
   - **hopper-medium-expert-v2**
   - **walker2d-medium-expert-v2**

2. **D4RL antmaze datasets**: These datasets include:
   - **antmaze-umaze-v0**
   - **antmaze-umaze-diverse-v0**
   - **antmaze-medium-play-v0**
   - **antmaze-medium-diverse-v0**
   - **antmaze-large-play-v0**
   - **antmaze-large-diverse-v0**

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The D4RL datasets are typically referenced in the context of their original publication. The relevant citation for the D4RL datasets is:

- For the D4RL datasets, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, OÔ¨År Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **D4RL locomotion datasets** (including halfcheetah, hopper, walker2d variants)
2. **D4RL antmaze datasets** (including umaze, medium, and large variants)

I will ensure to include the full citation for the D4RL datasets in any documentation or output I prepare.
