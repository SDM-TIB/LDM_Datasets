To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Population-Guided Parallel Policy Search for Reinforcement Learning" by Whiyoung Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include mentions of datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names but rather refer to the environments as benchmarks for their algorithm.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the MuJoCo environments. The relevant citation for the MuJoCo environments is:

- For the MuJoCo physics engine:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE, Oct 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the MuJoCo environments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information extracted, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.
