To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous-time q-learning for mean-field control problems" by Xiaoli Wei and Xiang Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets used for simulations or evaluations, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper discusses any datasets that are not widely known or are proprietary, I will note that as well, including any relevant details about how to access them or any conditions for use.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
