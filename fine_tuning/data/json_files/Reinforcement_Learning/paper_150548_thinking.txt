To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How does agency impact human-AI collaborative design space exploration? A case study on ship design with deep generative models" by Shahroz Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions constructing a generative design space (GDS) using a generative adversarial network trained on **52,591 designs of various ship types**. This indicates that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically where the authors describe the creation of the GDS. They mention that the GDS was constructed using **ShipHullGAN**, which was trained on a dataset of **52,591 design variations** that were geometrically and physically validated. This dataset is crucial for understanding the generative model's training process.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of different exploration modes but do not introduce new datasets. Therefore, I will confirm that the only dataset referenced is the one used for training the ShipHullGAN.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to their own work on ShipHullGAN, which is the source of the dataset. The citation for this work is:

- Khan, S., Goucher-Lambert, K., Kostas, K., & Kaklis, P. (2023). ShipHullGAN: A generic parametric modeller for ship hull design using deep convolutional generative model. *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*, 411, 116051.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **ShipHullGAN Dataset**: A dataset containing **52,591 geometrically and physically validated designs** of various ship types, used to train the ShipHullGAN model for generating diverse ship hull designs.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Khan, S., Goucher-Lambert, K., Kostas, K., & Kaklis, P. (2023). ShipHullGAN: A generic parametric modeller for ship hull design using deep convolutional generative model. *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*, 411, 116051.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
