To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the algorithm's performance across various simulated physics tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe multiple simulated environments used for testing their algorithm in the **Results** section. Specifically, they mention environments such as "cartpole," "cheetah," and "pendulum," which are likely to be datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation.

I will then compile a list of the environments mentioned in the **Results** section and any other relevant sections. The environments include:

1. **Cartpole**: A classic control task where the agent must balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Cheetah**: A task where the agent must move forward quickly with a cheetah-like body.
3. **Pendulum**: A task where the agent must swing a pendulum to an upright position.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, in this case, the environments are not traditional datasets with formal citations but rather standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community.

For the environments mentioned, I will provide a brief description and note that they are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research. Since they do not have formal citations like traditional datasets, I will reference the original sources where these environments were introduced or commonly used:

- **Cartpole**:

- **Cheetah**:

- **Pendulum**:

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the environments and their descriptions along with the appropriate citations. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
