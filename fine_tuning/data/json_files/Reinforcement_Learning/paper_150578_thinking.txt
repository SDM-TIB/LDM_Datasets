To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faithfulness Tests for Natural Language Explanations" by Pepa Atanasova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their tests to "four NLE models over three datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their tests. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **e-SNLI**: This dataset is described as containing natural language explanations for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. It is crucial to note the authors who created this dataset.

2. **CoS-E**: This dataset is used for common-sense question answering, and I will also need to find the original citation for this dataset.

3. **ComVE**: This dataset is for commonsense reasoning, and I will ensure to capture its citation as well.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **e-SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Oana-Maria Camburu, Eleonora Giunchiglia, Jakob Foerster, Thomas Lukasiewicz, and Phil Blunsom. *e-SNLI: Natural Language Inference with Natural Language Explanations*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31, pages 9539–9549, 2018.

- For **CoS-E**, the citation is:
  > Nazneen Fatema Rajani, Bryan McCann, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. *Explain Yourself! Leveraging Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4932–4942, 2019.

- For **ComVE**, the citation is:
  > Cunxiang Wang, Shuailong Liang, Yili Jin, Yilong Wang, Xiaodan Zhu, and Yue Zhang. *SemEval-2020 Task 4: Commonsense Validation and Explanation*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 307–321, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the details as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
