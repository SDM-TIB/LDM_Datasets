To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Connections between Relational Event Model and Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Characterizing Group Interaction Sequences" by Congyu Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant information is likely to be found in the **demonstrative experiment section** (Section 5), where the author describes the data used for the empirical analysis. I will pay close attention to any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In Section 5.1, the author mentions using a dataset from a Multiple Team System (MTS) collected and published by Pilny et al. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in the research. I will extract the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and the nature of the data collected (e.g., sender, receiver, timestamps of directed verbal messages).

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the MTS dataset is crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly. The relevant reference from the paper is:

- Pilny, A., Yahja, A., Poole, M. S., & Dobosh, M. (2014). A dynamic social network experiment with multi-team systems. In Big Data and Cloud Computing (BdCloud), 2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on, pages 587â€“593. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as part of the description.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
