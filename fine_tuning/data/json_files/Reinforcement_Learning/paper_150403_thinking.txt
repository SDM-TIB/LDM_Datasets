To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-Cogni: An Integrated Causal Reinforcement Learning Framework" by Cristiano da Costa Cunha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions applying Q-Cogni to the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** and specifically references the **Taxi & Limousine Commission trip record data** from New York City. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using the **Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym** and the **New York City TLC trip record data**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **background and validation sections**, the authors discuss the **Taxi-v3 environment**, which is a software implementation of a variant of the VRP. They also describe how they used the NYC TLC trip record data, which contains all taxi movements in New York City from 2013 to date. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

1. For the **Taxi-v3 environment**, the citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

2. For the **New York City TLC trip record data**, the citation is:
   > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. (2022). NYC TLC.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Taxi-v3 Environment**: A simulated environment for the Vehicle Routing Problem, used to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **New York City TLC Trip Record Data**: A real-world dataset containing all taxi movements in New York City from 2013 to the present, used to validate the Q-Cogni framework in a practical context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
