To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DisCor: Corrective Feedback in Reinforcement Learning via Distribution Correction" by Aviral Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their approach on various tasks, including **multi-task learning and continuous control tasks**. I will check if they specify any datasets related to these tasks.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for a **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. This section may include information such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any specific characteristics that define the datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **MetaWorld benchmark**, I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset to provide a complete citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining accuracy and completeness in the documentation process.
