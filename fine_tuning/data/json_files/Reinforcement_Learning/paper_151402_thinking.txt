To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AFU: Actor-Free Critic Updates in Off-Policy RL for Continuous Control" by Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify any specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their use in the experiments. These visual aids can sometimes contain crucial information that is not explicitly stated in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to reinforcement learning tasks, particularly those mentioned in the context of the MuJoCo benchmark, as the experiments focus on various MuJoCo tasks.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
