To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiased Bayesian inference for average treatment effects" by Kolyan Ray and Botond SzabÃ³, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "observational data" and "semi-synthetic data," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note these mentions and look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that explicitly discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors generated synthetic data based on specific functions and treatment assignments. They mention that this dataset is used to illustrate their method's performance.

2. **IHDP Dataset with Simulated Outcomes**: This dataset is derived from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) and includes real features and treatment assignments, but the outcomes are simulated. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and the number of subjects involved.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but can be described as follows:
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated following the protocol used in previous studies, with specific functions defined for treatment effects.

For the **IHDP Dataset**, the citation is:
> Hill, J. L. (2011). Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference. *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 20(1), 217-240. Supplementary material available online.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their sources for future reference or analysis.
