To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Ngoc Duy Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a game called **Milk Factory**, which is used to benchmark the proposed method. This suggests that the game itself may be a dataset or a testing environment.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** or **performance evaluation** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of **Milk Factory** as a multi-agent environment, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **performance evaluation** section, the authors describe how they benchmark their proposed scheme using **Milk Factory**. They detail the gameplay mechanics and the roles of different robots within the game, which further confirms that **Milk Factory** is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the **Milk Factory** game. However, since it appears to be a novel environment developed by the authors, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the game is developed in Python and follows the standard interface of Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and OpenAI Gym, which are established frameworks in reinforcement learning.

For the **Milk Factory** dataset, I will summarize the relevant details:
- **Milk Factory**: A multi-agent environment developed to simulate a warehouse task where robots automate the production chain. It includes two types of robots (pick-up and mechanic) and is designed to evaluate the proposed visual communication map method.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details and context for the **Milk Factory** dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the dataset information:
> Ngoc Duy Nguyen, Thanh Thi Nguyen, Doug Creighton, Saeid Nahavandi. *A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

With this information, I will be ready to create the dataset entry for **Milk Factory** and ensure that all relevant citations are included.
