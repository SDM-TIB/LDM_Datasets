To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CURIOUS: Intrinsically Motivated Modular Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning" by CÃ©dric Colas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for agents to set their own goals and build their own curriculum, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors describe a new environment called the **Modular Goal Fetch Arm**, which is based on the OpenAI Gym suite. However, they do not explicitly refer to any external datasets but rather describe the environment as a simulated setting for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references to other works. The authors reference several papers related to reinforcement learning and goal exploration, but again, they do not specify any datasets that are publicly available or commonly used in the field.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will note the environment used for the experiments, which is the **Modular Goal Fetch Arm**, as it is a significant part of the research.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the environment and any referenced works that may relate to datasets in the broader context of reinforcement learning.

In summary, the key points are:
- No specific datasets are mentioned in the paper.
- The **Modular Goal Fetch Arm** environment is used for experiments.
- Relevant references include foundational works in reinforcement learning, but no direct dataset citations are provided.

I will document this information clearly to ensure that it is accessible for future reference or analysis.
