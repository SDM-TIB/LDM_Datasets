To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New View on Planning in Online Reinforcement Learning" by Kevin Roice et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the work, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).

In this paper, the authors mention using three environments: **FourRooms**, **PinBall**, and **GridBall**. I will note down the details provided for each environment, as they serve as the datasets for the experiments.

1. **FourRooms**: This is a grid-world environment where the agent navigates through rooms to reach a goal. The paper describes it as having a fixed start state and goal state, with deterministic transitions.

2. **PinBall**: This environment involves navigating a ball through obstacles, represented in a continuous state space with positions and velocities. The paper specifies the state representation and the actions available to the agent.

3. **GridBall**: This is a modified version of PinBall, simplified to a grid-world format without velocity components. The paper describes how the agent interacts with this environment similarly to PinBall.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these environments. If the environments are based on existing datasets or frameworks, I will ensure to cite the original sources.

For the environments mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **FourRooms**: The original work describing the FourRooms environment is not explicitly cited in the paper, so I will note that it is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning literature.

- **PinBall**: The paper references the work by Konidaris and Barto (2009) for the PinBall environment. The citation is:
  > Konidaris, G. D., & Barto, A. G. (2009). Skill Discovery in Continuous Reinforcement Learning Domains using Skill Chaining. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- **GridBall**: This environment is derived from PinBall, and thus the same citation applies.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
