To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Kaleb Ben Naveed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using the **CARLA simulator**, which suggests that the authors may have utilized specific datasets or simulation environments for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they applied their proposed algorithm in the **CARLA simulator**. I will look for any specific datasets or configurations that are referenced in relation to the CARLA simulator.

In the **methodology section**, the authors discuss the scenario and problem description, indicating that they used a simulated urban environment with dynamic traffic. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they rely on the CARLA simulator for generating the scenarios, which is a key point to note.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or simulation environments. The CARLA simulator is referenced, and I will need to provide its full citation.

The citation for the CARLA simulator is:
> A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. M. LÃ³pez, and V. Koltun. *CARLA: an open urban driving simulator*. CoRR, vol. abs/1711.03938, 2017. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03938.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets apart from the CARLA simulator, I will summarize my findings accordingly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CARLA simulator, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry extracted from this paper, as it serves as the primary environment for the experiments conducted by the authors.
