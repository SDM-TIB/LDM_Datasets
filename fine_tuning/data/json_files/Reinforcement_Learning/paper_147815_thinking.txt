To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure Learning of Deep Neural Networks with Q-Learning" by Guoqiang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on image benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Image datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all colored and sized at 32 × 32 pixels, categorized into 10 classes.

2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset consists of 32 × 32 colored digit images, with 73,257 training images and 26,032 testing images, along with additional images for extended training.

3. **MNIST**: This well-known dataset includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each sized at 28 × 28 pixels.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments, which they are.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25: 26th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2012. Proceedings of a meeting held December 3-6, 2012, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, United States., pages 1106–1114, 2012.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1–5, 2011.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
