To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability Guided by Learned Environment Models" by Edi Muškardin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or evaluation sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and evaluation, which may include specific datasets used for testing their reinforcement learning methods.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using environments from the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. Specifically, they refer to environments like **OﬃceWorld**, **ConfusingOﬃceWorld**, **GravityDomain**, and **ThinMaze**. These environments are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed QA-learning method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will cite the relevant reference for the OpenAI Gym itself, as it serves as the source for these datasets:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. CoRR abs/1606.01540.

Additionally, I will note that the specific environments mentioned (OﬃceWorld, ConfusingOﬃceWorld, GravityDomain, and ThinMaze) are likely derived from the OpenAI Gym framework, and thus, they do not have separate citations but are part of the broader OpenAI Gym reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym as the source of the environments used in the experiments.

In summary, I will create entries for the datasets based on the environments used in the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for OpenAI Gym, which encompasses the datasets utilized in the research.
