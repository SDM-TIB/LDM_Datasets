To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi Modal Semantic Segmentation using Synthetic Data" by Kartik Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated synthetic scenes using the CARLA software framework, which suggests that CARLA is a dataset or tool used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss available labeled datasets for 3D semantic segmentation. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **Semantic 3D**: This dataset is referenced as having 30 scenes and is used for training and validation.
2. **KITTI**: This dataset is mentioned as having 93 scenes and is used for testing the effectiveness of the trained models.
3. **In-house generated dataset using CARLA**: This dataset consists of 4400 scenes generated through the CARLA simulator.

In **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their sizes, types of sensors, and the number of points. This section confirms the details of the datasets mentioned earlier.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **Semantic 3D**, the citation is:
  > Semantic3D.net. *Semantic 3D Dataset*. Available at: http://www.semantic3d.net

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354-3361, 2012. Available at: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > CARLA. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. Available at: https://carla.org

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
