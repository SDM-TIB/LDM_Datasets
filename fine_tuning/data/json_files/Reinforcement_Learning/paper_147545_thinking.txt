To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation" by Tuomas Haarnoja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of soft Q-learning to real-world robotic manipulation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention using a **Sawyer robot** for various tasks, including pushing tasks in simulation and real-world tasks like reaching and Lego block stacking. However, they do not specify any datasets by name.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might reference datasets or experimental setups. For instance, the paper includes figures illustrating the tasks performed by the robot, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Next, I will check the **related work section** (Section II) to see if the authors reference any existing datasets that are commonly used in the field of robotic manipulation. This section discusses various approaches and prior works but does not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to identify any papers that might have introduced datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. If the authors have cited foundational works that introduced datasets, I will note those citations.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that while the authors discuss their experimental setups and methodologies, they do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are specified in the paper.

In summary, my approach involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Looking for figures or tables that might reference datasets.
4. Checking the related work section for any common datasets in the field.
5. Reviewing the references for foundational works that might introduce relevant datasets.

Since no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document this finding accordingly.
