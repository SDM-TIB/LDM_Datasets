To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient DWT-based fusion techniques using genetic algorithm for optimal parameter estimation" by Kavitha S and Thyagharajan K K, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any specific datasets referenced there. 

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (System Design)**, particularly the **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe the brain images acquired through different modalities, specifically mentioning SPECT, MRI, and CT images collected from the Harvard Medical School website. 

The paper lists the specific combinations of images used for fusion in **Table 1**, which provides details about the datasets, including the types of images and their sizes. This table is crucial for understanding the datasets utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the source of the images, which is the Harvard Medical School website. I will ensure to note the citation format used in the paper for consistency.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **SPECT-Ti and SPECT-Tc**: These are SPECT images used in combination with MRI images for the fusion process.
2. **MRI-T2 and MRI-GAD**: These are MRI images that are also part of the dataset used for fusion.
3. **CT images**: These are used alongside the SPECT and MRI images.

The full citation for the dataset source is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
