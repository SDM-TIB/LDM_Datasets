To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistent Dropout for Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning" by Matthew Hausknecht and Nolan Wagener, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their methodology and the environments they tested. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets or environments used for training and evaluation. 

In this paper, the authors mention training on several environments, specifically:
1. **MuJoCo Half-Cheetah-v3**: A continuous control environment used for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **MuJoCo Hopper-v3**: Another continuous control environment used in the experiments.
3. **MuJoCo Walker2d-v3**: A third continuous control environment included in the evaluation.
4. **Atari Beamrider**: A discrete-action environment used for testing.
5. **Atari Breakout**: Another discrete-action environment included in the experiments.
6. **Atari Seaquest**: The third discrete-action environment mentioned.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The citations for the MuJoCo environments and Atari games are typically found in the original papers or documentation associated with those environments.

For the **MuJoCo environments**, the citation is:
- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

For the **Atari environments**, the citation is:
- **Atari**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as outlined above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
