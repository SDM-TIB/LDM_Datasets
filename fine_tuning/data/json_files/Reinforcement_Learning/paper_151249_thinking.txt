To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Surpassing legacy approaches and human intelligence with hybrid single- and multi-objective Reinforcement Learning-based optimization and interpretable AI to enable the economic operation of the US nuclear fleet" by Paul Seurin and Koroush Shirvan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the optimization of fuel cycle costs and the use of various algorithms, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the methodology section.

In the **methodology**, the authors describe the algorithms used for optimization, including Deep Reinforcement Learning and various Stochastic Optimization methods. They reference previous works and methodologies but do not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will check the **results section**. Here, the authors present findings from their experiments, including comparisons between different algorithms. They mention using data from previous studies but do not specify any datasets directly.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been used in the cited works. I will focus on the references that seem to relate to datasets or benchmarks in the context of nuclear reactor optimization.

After reviewing the references, I find that the following datasets are relevant:

1. **SIMULATE3**: This is a reactor physics code used for evaluating generated cores. The citation for this code is:
   > K. R. Rempe, K. S. Smith, and A. F. Henry. "SIMULATE-3 pin power reconstruction: methodology and benchmarking." *Nuclear Science and Engineering*, volume 103(4), pp. 334–342, 1989.

2. **CEC 2017 test suite**: This is a benchmark suite used for optimization problems. The citation is:
   > N. H. Awad, M. Z. Ali, P. N. Suganthan, J. J. Liang, and B. Y. Qu. "Problem Definitions and Evaluation Criteria for the CEC 2017 Special Session and Competition on Single Objective Real-Parameter Numerical Optimization." Technical report, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 2017.

3. **Various datasets from previous studies**: The authors reference their own previous works, which may contain datasets used for training and evaluation. The citations for these works are:
   > P. Seurin and K. Shirvan. "PWR Loading Pattern Optimization with Reinforcement Learning." *International Conference on Physics of Reactors (PHYSOR 2022)*, pp. 1166–1175, 2022.
   > P. Seurin and K. Shirvan. "Assessment of reinforcement learning algorithms for nuclear power plant fuel optimization." *Applied Intelligence*, 2024.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper.
