To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity-based Trajectory and Goal Selection with Hindsight Experience Replay" by Tianhong Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **five challenging robotic manipulation tasks**, which suggests that datasets or environments are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the environments used for training and evaluation. They mention five specific tasks:

1. **Push**: A task using a 7-DoF Fetch robotic arm to move a cube to a target position.
2. **Pick&Place**: Another task with the Fetch robot, requiring similar manipulation.
3. **EggFull**: A task using a 24-DoF Shadow Dexterous Hand to manipulate an egg.
4. **BlockRotate**: A task also using the Shadow Dexterous Hand to manipulate a block.
5. **PenRotate**: Another task with the Shadow Dexterous Hand, focusing on a pen.

In this section, the authors provide details about the environments, including the state and action representations, which indicates that these tasks are indeed based on specific datasets or simulation environments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper refers to environments developed by OpenAI, specifically mentioning the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized framework for developing and testing reinforcement learning algorithms.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Additionally, the paper references other works related to the robotic manipulation tasks, which may also be relevant for citation. However, the specific datasets for the tasks (like Push, Pick&Place, etc.) are typically part of the OpenAI Gym environments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each environment used in the experiments. The final output will be structured and ready for review or further processing.
