To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Mirror Descent with Lookahead" by Kimon Protopapas and Anas Barakat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to look for any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and if datasets are used, they may be mentioned here.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain explicit information about the datasets, including their sources and any citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "DeepSea RL environment," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will search for the original source of the dataset in the literature or online.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for any required formatting or further processing.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations accurately.
