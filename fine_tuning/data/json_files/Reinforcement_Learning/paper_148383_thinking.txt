To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guided Dialogue Policy Learning without Adversarial Learning in the Loop" by Ziming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of task-oriented dialogue systems and mention the use of reinforcement learning methods. However, I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Training Environment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to:

1. **MultiWOZ**: This is described as a multi-domain dialogue dataset that spans 7 distinct domains and contains 10,438 dialogues. The authors provide details about the average number of turns in dialogues, which is useful for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For **MultiWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Iñigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gasic. *MultiWOZ - A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5016–5026, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
