To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TILFA: A Unified Framework for Text, Image, and Layout Fusion in Argument Mining" by Qing Zong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new dataset introduced at the 10th Workshop on Argument Mining, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for. The introduction further elaborates on the **ImageArg** dataset, which includes both text and images related to contentious topics.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the **ImageArg** dataset in detail, which is used for the Argumentative Stance Classification and Image Persuasiveness Classification tasks. 

The paper specifies that the **ImageArg** dataset consists of tweets centered on topics like gun control and abortion, and it includes both text and images. The authors also mention the dataset's challenges, such as imbalanced data distribution and limited data size, which further confirms its significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **ImageArg** dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ImageArg Dataset**:
  > Zhexiong Liu, Meiqi Guo, Yue Dai, and Diane Litman. *ImageArg: A multi-modal tweet dataset for image persuasiveness mining*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Argument Mining, pages 1â€“18, Online and in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, 2022. 

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **ImageArg** dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
