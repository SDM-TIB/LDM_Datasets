To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Procedural Generalization by Planning with Self-Supervised World Models" by Ankesh Anand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of the model on **Procgen** and **Meta-World**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. Here, they clearly mention:

1. **Procgen**: A suite of 16 different Atari-like games designed to test procedural generalization. The paper states that it allows for varying difficulty settings and the number of levels seen during training.

2. **Meta-World**: A suite of 50 different tasks on a robotic SAWYER arm, which is used to evaluate task generalization. The authors specify that it has benchmarks focused on generalization, such as ML-1, ML-10, and ML-45.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For **Procgen**, the citation is:
> Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2020). Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning. In *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*.

For **Meta-World**, the citation is:
> Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2020). Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning. In *Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Procgen** - A suite of 16 Atari-like games for procedural generalization.
   - Citation: Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2020). Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning. In *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*.

2. **Meta-World** - A suite of 50 tasks for evaluating task generalization.
   - Citation: Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2020). Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning. In *Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)*.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
