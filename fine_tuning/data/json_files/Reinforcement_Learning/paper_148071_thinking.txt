To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Q-MIND: Defeating Stealthy DoS Attacks in SDN with a Machine-learning based Defense Framework" by Trung V. Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. In this paper, the authors mention that they use a labeled dataset for training the AI/ML algorithms. Specifically, they state that the dataset includes **4000 normal traffic samples and 4000 attack samples**, which were generated from simulations of stealthy DoS attacks in an SDN environment. This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors mention that the labeled dataset is either generated from their simulations or obtained from publicly available datasets. They reference a specific dataset in reference [11], which is from CAIDA (Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis). 

The citation for the CAIDA dataset is:
> CAIDA, “Description of CAIDA data sets, available at www.caida.org.”

Additionally, I will note that the authors did not provide a specific name for their simulated dataset, but they did mention the characteristics of the data they generated. Therefore, I will create an entry for the simulated dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Simulated Stealthy DoS Dataset**: Contains 4000 normal traffic samples and 4000 attack samples generated from simulations of stealthy DoS attacks in an SDN environment. (No formal citation, but described in the paper).

2. **CAIDA Dataset**: A publicly available dataset used for training and validation in network traffic analysis.
   > CAIDA, “Description of CAIDA data sets, available at www.caida.org.”

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary citations for future reference or analysis.
