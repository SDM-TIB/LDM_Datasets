To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergent and Efficient Deep Q Network Algorithm" by Zhikang T. Wang and Masahito Ueda, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including details about their size, type, and purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 benchmark** for their experiments. I will note this as a dataset, but I need to find the specific citation for the benchmark to provide a complete reference.

I will also check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 benchmark. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Here are the datasets I will document:

1. **Atari 2600 Benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically in the context of video games.

Now, I will look up the full citation for the Atari 2600 benchmark in the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for the Atari 2600 benchmark, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
