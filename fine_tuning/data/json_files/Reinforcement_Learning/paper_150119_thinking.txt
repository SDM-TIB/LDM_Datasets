To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometric Active Learning for Segmentation of Large 3D Volumes" by Thomas Lang and Tomas Sauer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the segmentation of volumetric data and hints at the use of computed tomography scans, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors provide a quantitative evaluation of their method. They mention applying their method to "seven selected datasets where ground truth data was available." This indicates that specific datasets are used for evaluation, and I need to find their names and details.

In **subsection 4.1 (Quantitative Evaluation)**, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **Ford Fiesta**: A CT scan of a crashed Ford Fiesta used to extract springs.
2. **Piston**: A CT scan of a piston.
3. **Big Piston**: Another CT scan of a larger piston.
4. **Tasterwald**: A calibration dataset.
5. **Ring**: A CT scan of a ring component.
6. **Rumpf**: A CT scan of a structural component.
7. **TPA**: Another calibration dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the datasets were created by the Fraunhofer Development Center for X-ray Technology (EZRT) in Fürth, which may serve as a citation for the datasets.

The full citation for the datasets can be summarized as follows:
- **Fraunhofer Development Center for X-ray Technology (EZRT)**. Various datasets used for segmentation tasks, created in Fürth, Germany.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as specified.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
