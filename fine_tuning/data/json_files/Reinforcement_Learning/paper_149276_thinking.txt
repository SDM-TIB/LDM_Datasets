To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Band Switch in Cellular-Connected UAV" by Gianluca Fontanesi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference existing datasets used in related works.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets" or similar, I will focus on that section for detailed information.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described. This may involve searching for the dataset names in academic databases or repositories.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
