To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Looking deeper into interpretable deep learning in neuroimaging: a comprehensive survey" by Md Mahfuzur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methods."** These sections typically contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the studies reviewed or discussed in the paper.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named, along with their descriptions, including the number of samples, types of data (e.g., MRI, fMRI), and any relevant details about how they were used in the context of the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**, I will look for the citation that provides details about this dataset, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a consistent format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for presentation or further processing, ensuring that it is clear and well-organized for anyone who may need to reference it in the future.
