To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Control of Continuous Quantum Systems with Many Degrees of Freedom based on Convergent Reinforcement Learning" by Wang Zhikang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. This includes looking for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In particular, I will focus on sections that discuss the **numerical experiments** and **evaluation methods**, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used, including their sources, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references, which might include authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
