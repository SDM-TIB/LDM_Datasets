To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-Learned Generators of Porosity Distributions Produced During Metal Additive Manufacturing" by Odinakachukwu Francis Ogokea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or comparisons. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are foundational to the research. The authors may discuss previous works that utilized specific datasets, which can guide me in identifying the datasets relevant to their study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. For instance, the authors describe the use of **3D computed tomography samples of Al10SiMg**. This indicates that the dataset consists of 3D CT scan data, which is crucial for their analysis.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional datasets mentioned, especially if the authors compare their generated results against existing datasets. They may also provide insights into the characteristics of the datasets used, such as the number of samples or specific metrics analyzed.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations.

For the dataset identified as **3D computed tomography samples of Al10SiMg**, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset. If the authors do not provide a specific citation, I may need to conduct a literature search to find the appropriate reference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
