To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Spectrum Sensing and Aggregation in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks" by Yunzeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of dynamic spectrum sensing and aggregation but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then proceed to the **methodology** section, where they are likely to detail the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets within the methodology. If the authors describe their experiments, they may reference specific datasets used for training or evaluation. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Cognitive Radio Dataset" for their experiments, I will search the references for the corresponding citation. If the dataset is not directly cited in the references, I may need to look for external sources or previous works that describe the dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset information is clearly organized and ready for presentation or further processing, adhering to any specified format or structure required for the output.
