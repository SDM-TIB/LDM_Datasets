To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Theory of Intentions for Human-Robot Collaboration" by Rocio Gomez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the architecture and its evaluation context, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using a simulated domain and physical robots for their experiments. I will check if they refer to any specific datasets or benchmarks that were used to validate their architecture. If they mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will also consider looking for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about the datasets used.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
