To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks" by Mikkel N. Schmidt and Morten Mørup, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics about each dataset.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experimental evaluation section**, where the authors analyze three example networks. The paper states:

1. **Zachary’s Karate Club**: An undirected unweighted network of friendships between 34 members of a karate club at a US university in the 1970s, consisting of 74 undirected links.
   
2. **Connectome of Caenorhabditis Elegans**: A directed integer weighted network of the 8,799 connections between the 302 neurons of the Caenorhabditis Elegans.

3. **Drugs and Side Effects**: A bipartite network on marketed medicines and their recorded adverse drug reactions, consisting of 996 drugs and 4,199 side effects with 100,049 unweighted links.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Zachary’s Karate Club**:
  > Zachary, W. (1977). An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups. *Journal of Anthropological Research*, 452-473.

- For **Connectome of Caenorhabditis Elegans**:
  > The complete connectome of C. Elegans has been compiled in various studies, notably referenced in the paper as [57].

- For **Drugs and Side Effects**:
  > Kuhn, M., Campillos, M., Letunic, I., Jensen, L. J., & Bork, P. (2010). A side effect resource to capture phenotypic effects of drugs. *Molecular Systems Biology*, 6(1).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for future reference.
