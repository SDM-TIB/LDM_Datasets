To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering Time-Series by a Novel Slope-Based Similarity Measure Considering Particle Swarm Optimization" by Hossein Kamalzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the **experimental results** section (section 5) provides a table listing the datasets used, along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **CinC_ECG_torso**: This dataset contains 1420 time-series samples, each with a length of 1639. It has 4 classes.
2. **HandOutlines**: This dataset consists of 1370 time-series samples, each with a length of 2709. It has 2 classes.
3. **Haptics**: This dataset includes 463 time-series samples, each with a length of 1092. It has 5 classes.
4. **InlineSkate**: This dataset has 650 time-series samples, each with a length of 1882. It has 7 classes.
5. **MALLAT**: This dataset contains 2400 time-series samples, each with a length of 1024. It has 8 classes.
6. **Phoneme**: This dataset consists of 2110 time-series samples, each with a length of 1024. It has 39 classes.
7. **StarLightCurves**: This dataset includes 9236 time-series samples, each with a length of 1024. It has 3 classes.
8. **UWaveGestureLibrary**: This dataset contains 4478 time-series samples, each with a length of 945. It has 8 classes.
9. **Worms**: This dataset consists of 258 time-series samples, each with a length of 900. It has 5 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from the UCR time-series classification archive. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the UCR archive:

- **UCR Time Series Classification Archive**: 
  > Yanping Chen, Eamonn Keogh, Bo Hu, Nazanin Begum, Aaron Bagnall, Amr Mueen, and Gustavo Batista. *UCR Time Series Classification Archive*. 2015. Available at: www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Time_series_data/.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCR archive as the source for all datasets mentioned in the paper.
