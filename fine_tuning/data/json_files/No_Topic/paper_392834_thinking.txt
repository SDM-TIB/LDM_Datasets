To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Dynamic Attribute-factored World Models for Efficient Multi-object Reinforcement Learning" by Fan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors state that they evaluate their framework on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations. In this paper, the authors mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **OpenAI Fetch environments**: This dataset is used for tasks involving pushing and switching objects. The authors describe the setup and the types of objects involved.

2. **Spriteworld**: This dataset is used for tasks involving object goals, interactions, comparisons, and property comparisons. The authors provide details about how the dataset is structured and the tasks involved.

3. **Block-stacking benchmark**: This dataset is used for stacking tasks with varying numbers of blocks and different mass combinations. The authors explain the experimental setup and the modifications made to the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **OpenAI Fetch environments**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For the **Spriteworld dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nicholas Watters, Loic Matthey, Matko Bosnjak, Christopher P Burgess, and Alexander Lerchner. *Cobra: Data-efficient model-based RL through unsupervised object discovery and curiosity-driven exploration*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.09275, 2019.

- For the **Block-stacking benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Plappert, Marcin Andrychowicz, Alex Ray, Bob McGrew, Bowen Baker, Glenn Powell, Jonas Schneider, Josh Tobin, Maciek Chociej, Peter Welinder, et al. *Multi-goal reinforcement learning: Challenging robotics environments and request for research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09464, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work or discussions.
