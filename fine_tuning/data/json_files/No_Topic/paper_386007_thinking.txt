To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-CALM: A Dynamic Clustering-based Active Learning Approach for Mitigating Bias" by Sabit Hassan and Malihe Alikhani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on eight datasets for various text classification tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention eight datasets, providing brief descriptions for each:

1. **BOOK32**: Contains 207K book titles categorized into 32 classes. The authors used a subset of 20K samples from the 10 most frequent classes.
2. **CONAN**: A hatespeech dataset with 5K instances annotated for various targets, including Disabled, Jews, LGBT+, and others.
3. **CARER**: An emotion detection dataset with six basic emotions, consisting of 16K training, 2K dev, and 2K test instances.
4. **CoLA**: Contains 9.5K sentences annotated for grammatical acceptability, using in-domain and out-of-domain splits.
5. **HATE**: A dataset of 24.7K tweets annotated as Offensive, Hatespeech, and Neither.
6. **MRDA**: Contains 117K instances annotated for dialog acts, with a focus on five basic labels.
7. **Q-Type**: A dataset with 5.5K train and 0.5K test instances annotated for question types.
8. **Subjectivity**: Contains 10K snippets from movie reviews tagged as Subjective or Objective.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **BOOK32**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
