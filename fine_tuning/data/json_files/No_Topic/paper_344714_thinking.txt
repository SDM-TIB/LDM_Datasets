To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entropy and the arrow of time in population dynamics" by Diogo Costa-Cabanas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay special attention to the **methods section** where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that may summarize data or results, as these often reference specific datasets. If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any discussions about the datasets used in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the "Moran process dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as needed.
