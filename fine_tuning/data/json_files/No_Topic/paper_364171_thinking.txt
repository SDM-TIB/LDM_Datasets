To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PVT++: A Simple End-to-End Latency-Aware Visual Tracking Framework" by Bowen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, specifically in the section discussing the evaluation of their framework.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **UAV20L**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating tracking performance in aerial scenarios.
2. **UAV123**: Another dataset used for performance evaluation, specifically designed for UAV tracking.
3. **UAVDT**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process, focusing on drone-based tracking challenges.
4. **DTB70**: This dataset is included in the experiments to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **UAV20L**:
  > Matthias Mueller, Neil Smith, and Bernard Ghanem. *A Benchmark and Simulator for UAV Tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 445–461, 2016.

- For **UAV123**:
  > Siyi Li and Dit-Yan Yeung. *Visual Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Benchmark and New Motion Models*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 4140–4146, 2017.

- For **UAVDT**:
  > Dawei Du, Yuankai Qi, Hongyang Yu, Yifan Yang, Kaiwen Duan, Guorong Li, Weigang Zhang, Qingming Huang, and Qi Tian. *The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Benchmark: Object Detection and Tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 370–386, 2018.

- For **DTB70**:
  > Siyi Li and Dit-Yan Yeung. *Visual Object Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Benchmark and New Motion Models*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 4140–4146, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the work presented by the authors.
