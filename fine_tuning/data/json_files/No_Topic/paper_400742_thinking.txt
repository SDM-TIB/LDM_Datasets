To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spectral Theory of Neural Prediction and Alignment" by Abdulkadir Canatar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss using a theoretical framework to analyze neural prediction errors and mention testing on various deep neural networks predicting visual cortical activity. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context about their research. They reference using neural datasets collected on texture stimuli for V1 and V2, and on object stimuli for V4 and IT. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

In the **methods section**, particularly in subsection 2.1 (Encoding Models of Neural Responses), the authors specify the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **V1/V2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of neural responses collected on 135 texture stimuli. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Freeman, J., & Ziemba, C. M. (2013). A functional and perceptual signature of the second visual area in primates. *Nature Neuroscience*, 16(7), 974-981.

2. **V4/IT Dataset**: This dataset includes 3200 object stimuli with natural backgrounds. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Majaj, N. J., Hong, H., Solomon, E. A., & DiCarlo, J. J. (2015). Simple learned weighted sums of inferior temporal neuronal firing rates accurately predict human core object recognition performance. *Journal of Neuroscience*, 35(39), 13402-13418.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their analyses, which further validates the datasets identified.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **V1/V2 Dataset**:
  > Freeman, J., & Ziemba, C. M. (2013). A functional and perceptual signature of the second visual area in primates. *Nature Neuroscience*, 16(7), 974-981.

- For the **V4/IT Dataset**:
  > Majaj, N. J., Hong, H., Solomon, E. A., & DiCarlo, J. J. (2015). Simple learned weighted sums of inferior temporal neuronal firing rates accurately predict human core object recognition performance. *Journal of Neuroscience*, 35(39), 13402-13418.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
