To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Twin-Merging: Dynamic Integration of Modular Expertise in Model Merging" by Zhenyi Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **12 datasets for both discriminative and generative tasks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on various benchmarks, specifically highlighting the **GLUE benchmark** for discriminative tasks and four specific benchmarks for generative tasks.

In **section 4.1**, the authors list the datasets used for the discriminative tasks as part of the GLUE benchmark, which includes:

1. **COLA** (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
2. **STS-B** (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)
3. **MRPC** (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)
4. **QQP** (Quora Question Pairs)
5. **SST-2** (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
6. **MNLI** (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
7. **QNLI** (Question Natural Language Inference)
8. **RTE** (Recognizing Textual Entailment)

For the generative tasks, the authors mention four specific datasets:

1. **MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
2. **TruthfulQA** (a benchmark for assessing the truthfulness of language models)
3. **BBQ** (a dataset highlighting social biases)
4. **CNN-DailyMail** (used for text summarization)

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
