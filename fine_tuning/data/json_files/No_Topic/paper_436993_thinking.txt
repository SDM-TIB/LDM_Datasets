To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmoEdit: Evoking Emotions through Image Manipulation" by Jingyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors assembled a dataset of **416 images**, categorized into positive, negative, and neutral classes. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They state that they collected **416 real images** sourced from user and artist uploads on the Internet, specifically noting that these images were categorized by a pre-trained emotion classifier on **EmoSet**. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and composition.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the EmoSet dataset, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The authors reference EmoSet as follows:

- For **EmoSet**, the citation is:
  > Jingyuan Yang, Qirui Huang, Tingting Ding, Dani Lischinski, Danny Cohen-Or, and Hui Huang. *EmoSet: A Large-scale Visual Emotion Dataset with Rich Attributes*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 20383–20394, 2023.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Dataset Name**: EmoSet
   - **Description**: A dataset of 416 images categorized into positive, negative, and neutral emotion classes, sourced from user and artist uploads on the Internet.
   - **Citation**: Jingyuan Yang, Qirui Huang, Tingting Ding, Dani Lischinski, Danny Cohen-Or, and Hui Huang. *EmoSet: A Large-scale Visual Emotion Dataset with Rich Attributes*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 20383–20394, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the datasets referenced in the paper.
