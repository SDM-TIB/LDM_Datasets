To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the Complexity and Its Impact on Testing in ML-Enabled Systems: A Case Study on Rasa" by Junming Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give context about the data used in the case study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their study design and data collection methods. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets used for experiments or analyses. 

In this paper, the authors mention using **MultiWoz**, a widely used multi-domain task-oriented dialogue system dataset, in their mutation testing analysis. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will then look for any specific details about the dataset in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors may provide insights into how the dataset was utilized, its characteristics, or any preprocessing steps taken.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWoz dataset**. The citation for this dataset is:
> Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gasic, M. (2018). Multiwoz - a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 5016â€“5026).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
