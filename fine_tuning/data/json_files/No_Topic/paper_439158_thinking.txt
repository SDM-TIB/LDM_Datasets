To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape Constraints in Symbolic Regression Using Penalized Least Squares" by Viktor Martinek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on symbolic regression and shape constraints, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention three benchmark problems used for their experiments:

1. **Gaussian Distribution**: This dataset is generated based on the density of a univariate Gaussian distribution. The authors specify the ranges for the independent variables and the number of points sampled, but they do not provide a formal citation since it is a synthetic dataset.

2. **Magnetic Manipulator Force**: This dataset describes the force exerted by an electromagnet on an iron ball. The authors reference a previous study for the parameters used in this dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Damsteeg, J.-W.; Nageshrao, S. P.; Babuska, R. "Model-based real-time control of a magnetic manipulator system." 2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), IEEE, 2017. doi:10.1109/cdc.2017.8264140.

3. **Van der Waals Force**: This dataset models the pressure of a fluid as a function of molar volume and temperature. The authors cite a specific source for the parameters used in this dataset:
   > Weast, R. C. "Handbook of Chemistry and Physics." CRC Press, 1972.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note that the Gaussian Distribution dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation, while the other two datasets have specific references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation where applicable. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
