To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Throughput and Compression Ratios: Towards High End-to-end Utility of Gradient Compression" by Shay Vargaftik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses gradient compression and its implications for distributed machine learning, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide further context or examples that could lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors conduct a case study involving three main types of gradient compression methods: sparsification, quantization, and low-rank decomposition. I will look for any specific datasets used in their experiments, particularly in the sections discussing the case study.

Upon reviewing the **case study** section, I find that the authors mention two specific tasks for evaluation: **VGG19** for classification on **TinyImageNet** and **BERT-large** for masked language modeling on **WikiText-103**. These are the datasets I need to document.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **TinyImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N 7, 7 (2015), 3.

2. **WikiText-103**: The citation is:
   > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843 (2016).

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:
- **TinyImageNet** with the citation provided.
- **WikiText-103** with the citation provided.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper and accurately documented the datasets and their citations.
