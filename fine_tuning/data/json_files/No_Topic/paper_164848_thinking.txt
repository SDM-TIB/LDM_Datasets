To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAST, TRAINABLE, MULTISCALE DENOISING" by Sungjoon Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the denoising approach but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context on image denoising but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors evaluate their method. Here, they mention using the **Berkeley dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates a dataset used for quantitative evaluation.

I will then look for a detailed description of the Berkeley dataset within the paper. The authors state that they evaluated their pipeline on **68 test images of the Berkeley dataset** and that high-quality images were collected from the Internet to train a filter bank. However, they do not provide extensive details about the dataset itself in this section.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the Berkeley dataset, I will check the **References section**. The citation for the Berkeley dataset is as follows:
> D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, July 2001, vol. 2, pp. 416â€“423.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the Berkeley dataset, including its citation, into a structured format for further processing.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any required output format.
