To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward-Consistent Dynamics Models Are Strongly Generalizable for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Fan-Ming Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research and often highlights key datasets used in the study. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors used to validate their methods. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may mention relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. This section is crucial as it usually lists the datasets along with descriptions of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

Upon identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

From the paper, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark is mentioned as a collection of offline tasks used for evaluation. The authors state that they evaluated their method on 21 offline tasks from D4RL.
   - Citation: Fu, J., Luo, K., and Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. CoRR, abs/2004.07219.

2. **NeoRL Benchmark**: Another benchmark used for evaluation, which includes various locomotion tasks.
   - Citation: Qin, R., Zhang, X., Gao, S., Chen, X.-H., Li, Z., Zhang, W., and Yu, Y. (2022). *NeoRL: A near real-world benchmark for offline reinforcement learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
