To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure–Adaptive Sequential Testing for Online False Discovery Rate Control" by Bowen Gang, Wenguang Sun, and Weinan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and applications of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) and any subsequent sections that detail applications or simulations. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention two datasets in the **applications section**:

1. **NYC Taxi Dataset**: This dataset records the counts of NYC taxi passengers every 30 minutes from July 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015. It is used for anomaly detection in time series data.

2. **IMPC Dataset**: This dataset is from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and involves a large study to functionally annotate every protein-coding gene by exploring the impact of gene knockouts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **NYC Taxi Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ahmad, S., Lavin, A., Purdy, S., and Agha, Z. (2017). Unsupervised real-time anomaly detection for streaming data. Neurocomputing, 262:134–147.

For the **IMPC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Karp, N. A., Mason, J., Beaudet, A. L., Benjamini, Y., Bower, L., Braun, R. E., Brown, S. D., Chesler, E. J., Dickinson, M. E., Flenniken, A. M., et al. (2017). Prevalence of sexual dimorphism in mammalian phenotypic traits. Nature communications, 8:15475.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
