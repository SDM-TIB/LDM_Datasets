To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Skill Networks: Unsupervised Robot Skill Learning from Video" by Oier Mees et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the learning of skills from unlabeled multi-view videos, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but it does not specify any names.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors elaborate on the challenges of reinforcement learning and the need for unsupervised skill learning. While they mention the use of videos, they do not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methods and datasets. This section is likely to contain the specific datasets used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing this section, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Simulated Robot Tasks Dataset**: This dataset consists of three simulated robot tasks: stacking (A), color pushing (B), and color stacking (C). It contains 300 multi-view demonstration videos per task, with a mix of successful and unsuccessful executions.

2. **Real-World Human Execution Dataset**: This dataset includes real-world demonstrations of the simulated tasks (A, B, and C) and an additional task (D) where blocks must be separated before stacking. It contains 60 multi-view demonstration videos per task, totaling 24 minutes of interaction.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described in the context of the experiments without specific external citations. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of each dataset, along with the context in which they were used in the experiments. 

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and that the citations are formatted correctly, even if they are not traditional references. This will help maintain clarity and provide proper attribution for the datasets used in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Simulated Robot Tasks Dataset**: Contains 300 multi-view demonstration videos for three tasks (stacking, color pushing, color stacking).
2. **Real-World Human Execution Dataset**: Contains 60 multi-view demonstration videos for four tasks (stacking, color pushing, color stacking, and separating blocks).

I will ensure that the descriptions are clear and concise, providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
