To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Radar2: Passive Spy Radar Detection and Localization using COTS mmWave Radar" by Yanlong Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a system for detecting and localizing spy radars, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are most likely to be described. I will look for any references to datasets used for training, testing, or validating the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation setup, including the use of various COTS mmWave radars and the environments in which they were tested. However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets or benchmarks that were used in their experiments. Instead, they seem to rely on their own experimental setups and data collected during their tests.

Since no external datasets are mentioned, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. This could include foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in the field of radar detection and localization.

After reviewing the references, I find that while the paper discusses various radar technologies and methods, it does not provide specific dataset citations. Therefore, I will conclude that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The authors conducted experiments using their own data collected from COTS mmWave radars.**
3. **No external datasets were cited in the references.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries. Instead, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner for future reference.
