To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drones4Good: Supporting Disaster Relief Through Remote Sensing and AI" by Nina Merkle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of drone-based data combined with deep learning for automated situation assessment, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the importance of timely information in disaster response, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets used for mapping and analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the training and evaluation of their models. Here, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **DeepGlobe18 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,632 km² of annotated image data at a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 50 cm/px from Southeast Asia. It is used for training the road segmentation model.

2. **Inria Dataset**: This dataset contains 405 km² of labeled image data at a GSD of 20 cm/px from the USA and Austria, utilized for building segmentation training.

3. **Custom Person Detection Dataset**: The authors created a new dataset consisting of 311 aerial and drone images covering various scenarios and countries, with a total of 10,050 annotated persons. This dataset is crucial for training the person detection model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **DeepGlobe18 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Inria Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
