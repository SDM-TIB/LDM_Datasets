To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Execution of Graph Algorithms" by Petar Veličković et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on graph algorithms and neural networks, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the types of graphs generated for their experiments. They mention generating undirected graphs from seven categories, which indicates that these categories may serve as datasets for their experiments. The categories listed are:

1. **Ladder graphs**
2. **2D grid graphs**
3. **Trees (uniformly randomly generated from the Prüfer sequence)**
4. **Erdős-Rényi graphs**
5. **Barabási-Albert graphs**
6. **4-Community graphs**
7. **4-Caveman graphs**

Each of these categories represents a different type of graph structure used in their experiments, and I will treat them as datasets.

In **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, the authors provide results based on these graph types, confirming their use in the experiments. However, I need to ensure that I find the full citations for any datasets or foundational papers that describe these graph types.

I will then consult the **References section** to find full citations for the foundational works related to these graph types. Here are the relevant citations I will include:

- For **Erdős-Rényi graphs**:
  > Erdős, P., & Rényi, A. (1960). On the evolution of random graphs. *Publ. Math. Inst. Hung. Acad. Sci*, 5(1), 17–60.

- For **Barabási-Albert graphs**:
  > Albert, R., & Barabási, A.-L. (2002). Statistical mechanics of complex networks. *Reviews of Modern Physics*, 74(1), 47.

- For **Prim's algorithm** (which is used in the context of minimum spanning trees):
  > Prim, R. C. (1957). Shortest connection networks and some generalizations. *The Bell System Technical Journal*, 36(6), 1389–1401.

- For **Prufer sequences** (used for generating trees):
  > Prufer, A. (1918). Neuer Beweis eines Satzes über die Bäume. *Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik*, 144, 1–2.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
