To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting cutaneous basal cell carcinomas in ultra-high resolution and weakly labelled histopathological images" by Susanne Kimeswenger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of diagnosing basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and mention the use of machine learning methods. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section** where the authors describe their approach to handling ultra-high resolution images. They mention using whole slide images (WSI) but do not provide specific dataset names yet.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used a set of 838 histological slides, which includes 647 BCC cases and 191 normal skin cases. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the histological slides used. Instead, it mentions that the images were retrospectively collected from the Medical University of Vienna and the Kepler University Hospital, along with ethics approval numbers.

Since there are no formal dataset names provided in the paper, I will note that the dataset consists of histological slides from these institutions, but I cannot provide a formal citation for a dataset as it is not explicitly named in the text.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
- **Histological Slides Dataset**: A collection of 838 histological slides, including 647 BCC cases and 191 normal skin cases, collected from the Medical University of Vienna and the Kepler University Hospital.

I will document this information clearly, noting the lack of a formal citation for the dataset as it was not specified in the paper.
