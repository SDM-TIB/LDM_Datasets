To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDK: A Deep Koopman Approach for Dynamics Modeling and Trajectory Tracking of Autonomous Vehicles" by Yongqian Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset consisting of about 60 km of data collected from a real electric SUV, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their dataset collection and preprocessing. Here, they mention that the datasets consist of 20 episodes covering various driving scenarios, including straight roads, U-turns, roundabouts, and lane changes, with a total distance of about 60 km. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also refer to datasets from previous works, specifically mentioning that they utilized datasets from [22], which is a prior work by the same authors. This indicates that I need to look at the references to find the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned in [22]. The citation is:
> Y. Xiao, X. Zhang, X. Xu, X. Liu, and J. Liu, “A deep learning framework based on koopman operator for data-driven modeling of vehicle dynamics,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02219, 2020.

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions using CarSim for high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation, which may also be relevant for dataset extraction, but it does not provide a specific dataset citation.

In summary, I will compile the following dataset information:

1. **Dataset from real electric SUV**: This dataset consists of 20 episodes covering various driving scenarios with a total distance of about 60 km.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is derived from the experiments conducted by the authors.

2. **Dataset from [22]**: This dataset is referenced for vehicle dynamics modeling.
   - Citation: Y. Xiao, X. Zhang, X. Xu, X. Liu, and J. Liu, “A deep learning framework based on koopman operator for data-driven modeling of vehicle dynamics,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02219, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing.
