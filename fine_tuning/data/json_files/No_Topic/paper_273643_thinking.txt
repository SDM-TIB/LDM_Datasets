To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-inconsistency with rough volatility" by Bingyan Han and Hoi Ying Wong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were used in the research.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used. I will note down the names, sizes, and any specific characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
