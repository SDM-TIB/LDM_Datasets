To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning with Partial Model Personalization" by Krishna Pillutla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss experiments on **real-world image, text, and speech datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four tasks along with their corresponding datasets:

1. **StackOverflow Dataset**: Used for next-word prediction, comprising questions and answers from the StackOverflow website.

2. **GLDv2 Dataset**: A large-scale image dataset for landmark recognition, containing images of global landmarks.

3. **EMNIST Dataset**: An extension of the MNIST dataset for character recognition, containing handwritten letters and digits.

4. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: A speech-to-text dataset containing audio snippets from audiobooks, used for automatic speech recognition.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about each dataset, including the number of classes and the specific tasks they are used for. This information is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **StackOverflow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > TensorFlow Federated. *StackOverflow Dataset*. Available at: https://www.tensorflow.org/federated.

- For the **GLDv2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weyand, T., Araujo, A., Cao, B., & Sim, J. (2020). *Google Landmarks Dataset v2 - A Large-Scale Benchmark for Instance-Level Recognition and Retrieval*. In Proceedings of CVPR, pages 2572–2581.

- For the **EMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv Preprint.

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). *LibriSpeech: an ASR Corpus based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In ICASSP, pages 5206–5210.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This ensures that all relevant details are captured for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
