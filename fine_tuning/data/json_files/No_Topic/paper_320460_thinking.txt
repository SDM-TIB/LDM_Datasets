To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interactive Visualization Tool for Understanding Active Learning" by Zihan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses an interactive visualization tool for active learning, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the importance of explainability in machine learning and mentions active learning but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will look for any datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using the **CASP dataset**, which contains 45,730 instances. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the CASP dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Ryan Rossi and Nesreen Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015.

Since the CASP dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
