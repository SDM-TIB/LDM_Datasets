To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Copula Variational Bayes inference via information geometry" by Viet Hung Tran, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of these datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets"** or **"Experiments"** section. If such sections exist, they will likely contain the names and descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

While reviewing these sections, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. For example, if the paper mentions using a specific dataset for training or testing, I will document that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets, I will also verify their citations against existing literature to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper accurately and comprehensively.
