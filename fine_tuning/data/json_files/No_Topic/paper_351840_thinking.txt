To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Driving Points Prediction For Abdominal Probabilistic Registration" by Samuel Joutard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on two datasets:

1. **L2R 2020 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30 abdominal CT volumes, which include segmentation for 13 anatomical structures. The authors refer to this dataset as the "CT dataset."

2. **CHAOS MR Dataset**: This dataset contains 40 MR volumes from different patients, with annotations for 4 structures. The authors refer to this dataset as the "MR dataset."

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **L2R 2020 Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hering, A., Hansen, L., Mok, T.C.W., et al. *Learn2reg: comprehensive multi-task medical image registration challenge, dataset and evaluation in the era of deep learning*. In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2021.

- For the **CHAOS MR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kavur, A.E., Selver, M.A., Dicle, O., Barış, M., Gezer, N.S. *CHAOS - Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation Challenge Data*. 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
