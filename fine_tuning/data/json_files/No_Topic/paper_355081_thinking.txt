To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoreDeep: Improving Crack Detection Algorithms Using Width Stochasticity" by Ramkrishna Pandey and Akshit Achara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the **datasets section** is likely where detailed information will be found.

In **section 2 (Datasets used for study)**, the authors mention using the **Kaggle crack segmentation dataset**, which is described as containing around 11,298 images obtained from merging 12 crack segmentation datasets, including some non-crack images. The dataset is split into training and testing folders, with specific counts for each.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several datasets in the context of their experiments, including:

1. **CFD Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating its importance in the study.
2. **crack500 Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned, which is likely used for comparison.
3. **cracktree200 Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced in the context of their experiments.
4. **DeepCrack Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation.
5. **Eugen Muller Dataset**: Another dataset included in their analysis.
6. **forest Dataset**: Referenced in the context of their experiments.
7. **GAPS384 Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation.
8. **Rissbilder Dataset**: Included in their analysis.
9. **Sylvie Chambon Dataset**: Another dataset referenced in the experiments.
10. **Volker Dataset**: Mentioned as part of their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

For the **Kaggle crack segmentation dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle Crack Segmentation Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaymiddha/crack-segmentation-dataset, accessed 2020.

For the other datasets, I will look for their respective citations in the references. For example, the **CFD dataset** citation might look like:
> Shi, Yong, Limeng Cui, Zhiquan Qi, Fan Meng, and Zhensong Chen. "Automatic road crack detection using random structured forests." IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 17, no. 12 (2016): 3434-3445.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
