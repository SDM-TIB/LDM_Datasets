To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Word Embeddings for Increased Diversity of Representation" by Brian Lester et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on concatenating multiple pre-trained embeddings, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various models and techniques but do not explicitly mention datasets. I will proceed to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 2 (Experiments & Results)**, the authors list several tasks and the corresponding datasets used for those tasks. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL 2003**: A dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) based on news text, converted to the IOBES format.
2. **WNUT-17**: A dataset for NER focusing on new and emerging entities from noisy user-generated text, also converted to IOBES format.
3. **OntoNotes**: A larger NER dataset with multiple entity types, converted to IOBES format.
4. **Snips**: A slot-filling dataset for virtual assistant commands, converted to CoNLL format.
5. **TW-POS**: A part-of-speech tagging dataset derived from Twitter.
6. **SST2**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset based on movie reviews.
7. **AG-NEWS**: A text classification dataset for categorizing news articles.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
