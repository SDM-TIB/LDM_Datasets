To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demystifying a Dark Art: Understanding Real-World Machine Learning Model Development" by Angela Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions analyzing over 475k user-generated workflows on OpenML, which indicates that OpenML is a significant dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe their dataset as being derived from a snapshot of the OpenML database from December 4, 2019. This is a clear indication that OpenML is the primary dataset used for their analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss insights derived from the OpenML dataset, including user-generated workflows and performance metrics. They also mention that the dataset contains information about various machine learning tasks, models, and preprocessing techniques used by the users.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenML dataset. The citation for OpenML is as follows:
> Vanschoren, J., van Rijn, J. N., Bischl, B., & Torgo, L. (2013). OpenML: Networked Science in Machine Learning. *SIGKDD Explorations*, 15(2), 49-60. https://doi.org/10.1145/2641190.2641198

Since OpenML is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for OpenML as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
