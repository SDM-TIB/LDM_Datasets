To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate and Scalable Estimation of Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks" by Puja Trivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a new uncertainty quantification method (G-âˆ†UQ) across various distribution shifts, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experimental setup** section, the authors mention using four well-known benchmark binary graph classification datasets from the TUDataset repository: **D&D**, **NCI1**, **NCI109**, and **PROTEINS**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then check the **results** section to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional details about their characteristics or usage in the experiments.

After confirming the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **D&D Dataset**:
   > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

2. **NCI1 Dataset**:
   > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

3. **NCI109 Dataset**:
   > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

4. **PROTEINS Dataset**:
   > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. In ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
