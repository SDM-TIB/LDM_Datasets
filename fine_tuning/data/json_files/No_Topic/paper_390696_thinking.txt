To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Rapid Early Progression and Survival Risk with Pre-Radiation MRI in WHO Grade 4 Glioma Patients" by Walia Farzana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including the importance of MRI in evaluating glioblastoma patients. They mention analyzing MRI sequences of 70 patients, which indicates that patient data is a key dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **"Patient Data."** Here, the authors describe the cohort of patients treated at OhioHealth, detailing the inclusion criteria and the number of patients (95 total, with 70 included in the analysis). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides insight into its structure.

The paper also references the **BRATS 2021 challenge** dataset, which is used for training the segmentation model. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Patient Data**: The dataset consists of MRI sequences from 70 glioblastoma patients treated at OhioHealth. The specific citation for this dataset is not provided in the references, but it is derived from the authors' own research.

2. **BRATS 2021 Challenge Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Menze, B.H.; Jakab, A.; Bauer, S.; Kalpathy-Cramer, J.; Farahani, K.; Kirby, J.; Burren, Y.; Porz, N.; Slotboom, J.; Wiest, R.; et al. *The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)*. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 2015, 34, 1993â€“2024, doi:10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.
