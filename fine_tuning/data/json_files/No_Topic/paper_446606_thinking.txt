To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invisible Optical Adversarial Stripes on Traffic Sign against Autonomous Vehicles" by Yuting Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that outline the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments and mention using a specific dataset for training their traffic sign recognition model. I will note down the name of this dataset and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, classes, and any specific attributes that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors used the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
