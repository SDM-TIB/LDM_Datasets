To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Position Aware Decay Weighted Network for Aspect based Sentiment Analysis" by Avinash Madasu and Vijjini Anvesh Rao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on two standard datasets from SemEval 2014 Task 4, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they performed experiments on two datasets: **Restaurant** and **Laptop**. Each dataset is described as containing triplets of sentence, aspect, and sentiment label, which provides context about the nature of the data.

I will also check the **statistics table (Table 2)** in section 4.1, which provides additional details about the datasets, including the number of training and testing samples for each sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral). This confirms the datasets' relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the SemEval 2014 Task 4 paper, which is the authoritative source for both datasets. The citation for this reference is:

- For the **Restaurant and Laptop datasets**:

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
