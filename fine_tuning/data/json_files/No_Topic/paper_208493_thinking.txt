To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Lazy Training in Differentiable Programming" by Lénaïc Chizat, Edouard Oyallon, and Francis Bach, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the work, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in Section 3, where they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their numerical experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In Section 3.2, the authors detail their experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. They describe the training process and the architecture used, confirming that this dataset is central to their experimental results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly cited, and I can retrieve its citation from the references provided in the paper. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:

> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
