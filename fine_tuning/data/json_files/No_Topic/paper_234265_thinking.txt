To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Natural Language Instructions to Complex Processes: Issues in Chaining Trigger Action Rules" by Nobuhiro Ito et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the creation of a dataset for complex workflows, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the lack of datasets for pairing complex workflows with their corresponding natural language descriptions. This indicates that the paper may propose a new dataset or utilize existing ones.

In the **Formal Expression and Grammar** section, the authors reference the **IFTTT dataset** as a notable example of a dataset that contains trigger-action programming (TAP) programs with corresponding natural language descriptions. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

The **Dataset Creation** section elaborates on how the authors use the IFTTT dataset to generate a new complex workflow dataset. They describe the process of extracting relationships from the IFTTT dataset and generating TAP chain rules, which further confirms the importance of the IFTTT dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IFTTT dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **IFTTT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ur, B., Pak Yong Ho, M., Brawner, S., Lee, J., Mennicken, S., Picard, N., Schulze, D., & Littman, M. L. (2016). Trigger-action programming in the wild: An analysis of 200,000 IFTTT recipes. In Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '16), 3227â€“3231. New York, NY, USA: ACM.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the IFTTT dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
