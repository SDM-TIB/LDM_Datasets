To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond CNNs: Exploiting Further Inherent Symmetries in Medical Image Segmentation" by Shuchao Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real-world clinical data, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental settings. In this section, they mention using a **public and available liver tumor segmentation dataset** that includes 131 contrast-enhanced abdominal 3D CT scans. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **discussion sections**. The authors reference experiments on **COVID-19 lung infection segmentation**, **retinal vessel detection**, **prostate segmentation on MRI**, and **thyroid segmentation on ultrasonography**. Each of these tasks likely corresponds to specific datasets.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Liver Tumor Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset includes 131 contrast-enhanced abdominal 3D CT scans collected from various subjects. The authors do not provide a specific citation in the text, but I will look for the original source in the references.

2. **COVID-19 Lung Infection Dataset**: The authors mention using a well-labeled COVID-19 CT dataset for evaluating lung and infection regions. I will check the references for the original paper by Ma et al. that describes this dataset.

3. **DRIVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for retinal vessel detection and is mentioned in the context of evaluating their method against specialized methods. I will find the citation for this dataset in the references.

4. **Prostate MRI Dataset**: The authors describe a dataset for prostate segmentation involving multiple centers and MRI devices. I will look for the citation in the references.

5. **Thyroid US Dataset**: This dataset is used for thyroid segmentation and is also mentioned in the experiments. I will find its citation in the references.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Liver Tumor Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
