To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MHLR: Moving Haar Learning Rate Scheduler for Large-scale Face Recognition Training with One GPU" by Xueyuan Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a dataset called **WebFace12M**, which contains over 12 million face images. This is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **MS1MV2**: Also referred to as MS1M-ArcFace, this dataset contains more than 5.8 million images with 0.085 million identities.
2. **MS1MV3**: Known as MS1M-RetinaFace, it includes over 5 million images with 0.09 million identities.
3. **WebFace4M**: A subset of WebFace42M, containing 4 million images.
4. **WebFace8M**: Another subset of WebFace42M, containing 8 million images.
5. **WebFace12M**: A subset of WebFace42M, containing over 12 million images with 0.6 million identities.
6. **WebFace42M**: The full dataset containing 42 million images with 2 million identities.

The authors also mention several public test sets used for evaluation, including **LFW**, **CFP-FP**, **AgeDB-30**, **IJB-B**, and **IJB-C**.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
