To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Affective Representations of Music-Induced EEG Through Multimodal Supervision and Latent Domain Adaptation" by Kleanthis Avramidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of limited neuronal data and inter-subject variability, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets to address these issues. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **DEAP dataset**. The DEAP dataset is described as a comprehensive dataset that includes EEG signals of music listening, collected from 32 subjects, and provides detailed information about the experimental setup, including the emotional ratings given by subjects.

I will extract the relevant details about the DEAP dataset, including its purpose, the number of subjects, and the nature of the data collected. The authors also mention that they used music stimuli that were independently annotated by experimenters, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the DEAP dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Koelstra, S., et al. "DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 3, 2011.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the necessary information, ensuring that the citation is correctly formatted and included. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
