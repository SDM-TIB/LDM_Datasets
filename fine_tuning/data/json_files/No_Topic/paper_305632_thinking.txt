To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CasEE: A Joint Learning Framework with Cascade Decoding for Overlapping Event Extraction" by Jiawei Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the evaluation is conducted on a public event extraction benchmark called **FewFC**, which indicates that this is a dataset I need to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **FewFC** dataset in section 4.1, where they describe it as a Chinese financial event extraction benchmark. They provide some statistics about the dataset, including the number of sentences with and without overlapping elements, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FewFC dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
> Zhou, Yubo, Chen, Yubo, Zhao, Jun, Wu, Yin, Xu, Jiexin, and Li, Jinlong. *What the role is vs. what plays the role: Semi-supervised event argument extraction via dual question answering*. In Proceedings of AAAI-21, 2021.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The dataset entry will include:
- **Name**: FewFC
- **Description**: A Chinese financial event extraction benchmark that includes sentences with overlapping event elements.
- **Citation**: Zhou, Yubo, Chen, Yubo, Zhao, Jun, Wu, Yin, Xu, Jiexin, and Li, Jinlong. *What the role is vs. what plays the role: Semi-supervised event argument extraction via dual question answering*. In Proceedings of AAAI-21, 2021.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
