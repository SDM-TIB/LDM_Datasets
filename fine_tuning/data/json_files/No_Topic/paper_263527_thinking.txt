To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Attack on Facial Recognition using Visible Light" by Morgan Frearson and Kien Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses adversarial attacks on facial recognition systems but does not mention specific datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **literature review** and **methodology sections**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in prior research or those that the authors have utilized in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of training or testing the facial recognition systems.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any datasets that are referenced in relation to the experiments conducted. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which would be crucial for my extraction.

I will also check the **references section** at the end of the paper to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This section typically contains the necessary bibliographic information that I need to provide complete citations.

Throughout this process, I will take notes on each dataset, including its name, a brief description, and the full citation as it appears in the references. If the authors refer to well-known datasets (like LFW or other facial recognition datasets), I will ensure to include their standard citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further studies or applications in the field of adversarial attacks on facial recognition systems.
