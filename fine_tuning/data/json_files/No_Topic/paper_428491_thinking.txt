To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synapse: Learning Preferential Concepts from Visual Demonstrations" by Sadanand Modak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation and evaluation sections**. In section 4 (Evaluation), the authors describe their experiments in detail, including the datasets used. They mention a dataset of **815 labeled images taken from the UT Austin campus area**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **implementation details** and **results sections**. The authors provide information about how they collected the data, including the number of demonstrations and the types of data (e.g., RGB images and LiDAR point clouds) used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **UT Austin Campus Dataset**: This dataset consists of 815 labeled images, which are used to evaluate the performance of the Synapse framework on three mobility-related concepts: CONTINGENCY, DROPOFF, and PARKING. The dataset is split into training, in-distribution test, and out-of-distribution test sets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is custom and specific to this research, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will document it as follows:

- **UT Austin Campus Dataset**: 
  > Modak, S., Patton, N., Dillig, I., & Biswas, J. (2023). *Synapse: Learning Preferential Concepts from Visual Demonstrations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). 

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset information along with the necessary citations. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
