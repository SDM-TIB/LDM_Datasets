To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Low-Parametric Model for Bit-Rate Estimation of VVC Residual Coding" by Fabian Brand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for fast bit rate estimation in video compression, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look for more detailed information in the introduction and experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various rate-control algorithms and mention the importance of estimating bit rates without encoding entire blocks. However, they do not reference any specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors mention that they encoded images from the **DIV2K dataset** using VTM 10.0. This indicates that the DIV2K dataset is used for their experiments.

I will now look for the full citation of the DIV2K dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- **DIV2K dataset**:
  > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte, “NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study,” in Proc. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), July 2017, pp. 1122–1131.

Additionally, the authors reference other models and datasets in their comparisons, such as the **ρ-domain model** and the **logistic model**, but these are not datasets in themselves. They are methodologies or models used for comparison.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that the only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in the experiments is the **DIV2K dataset**.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
