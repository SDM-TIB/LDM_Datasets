To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insta(nt) Pet Therapy: GAN-generated Images for Therapeutic Social Media Content" by Tanish Jain, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may hint at the datasets used. In this case, it discusses the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create pet images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly describes the datasets used in the project. Here, the author mentions two specific datasets:

1. **Dogs vs Cats Kaggle Dataset**: This dataset contains 25,000 images, evenly split between dogs and cats. It is crucial to note the dataset's purpose and its relevance to the research.

2. **Cats and Dogs Breeds Classification Oxford Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,393 images with a ratio of approximately 2:1 for cat images to dog images. The author discusses the advantages of using this dataset over others, which is important for understanding its significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Dogs vs Cats Kaggle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. *Dogs vs. Cats*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.

- For the **Cats and Dogs Breeds Classification Oxford Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. C. (2018). *Cats and Dogs Breeds Classification Oxford Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/zippyz/cats-and-dogs-breeds-classification-oxford-dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly presented and properly referenced for future use.
