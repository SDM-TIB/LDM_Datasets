To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design Analysis and Experimental Validation of Relaxation Oscillator-Based Circuit for R-C Sensors" by Mohamad Idris Wani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets generated or used during the experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe experiments conducted with various operational amplifiers and sensors. They mention testing the circuit with a fabricated water-level sensor and using a commercial LCR meter (Agilent E4980A) to measure capacitance and resistance. However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. This section may contain citations to other works that include datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper or related works. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper primarily discusses experimental results without referencing external datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations formatted correctly for any datasets or related works identified during my review. This will include the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experimental results for specific datasets used or generated.
3. Check the references for any related datasets or works.
4. Compile full citations for any identified datasets or related works.
5. Note if no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets referenced in the research paper.
