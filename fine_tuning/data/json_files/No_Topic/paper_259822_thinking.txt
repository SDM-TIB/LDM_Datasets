To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blind Video Temporal Consistency via Deep Video Prior" by Yazhou Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the method is demonstrated on **7 computer vision tasks**, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **DAVIS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for various applications in the experiments. It is important to note that the authors do not provide a detailed description of the dataset in this section, so I will need to look for the citation in the references.

2. **Test set collected by Bonneel et al.**: This is mentioned in the context of dehazing and spatial white balancing tasks. Again, I will need to find the citation for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DAVIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federico Perazzi, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Brian McWilliams, Luc Van Gool, Markus Gross, and Alexander Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 724–732, 2016.

- For the **test set collected by Bonneel et al.**, the citation is:
  > Nicolas Bonneel, James Tompkin, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Deqing Sun, Sylvain Paris, and Hanspeter Pﬁster. *Blind video temporal consistency*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 34(6):196:1–196:9, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
