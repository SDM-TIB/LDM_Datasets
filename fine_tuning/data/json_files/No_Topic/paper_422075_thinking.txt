To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random features and polynomial rules" by Fabián Aguirre-López et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, as this is where the authors usually detail the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing their models. I will look for specific dataset names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics that are described.

After that, I will check the **results** section, where the authors may discuss the performance of their models on the datasets. This section might provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it online or in academic databases to ensure I have the correct reference.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy access and reference in future work.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a high standard of academic rigor.
