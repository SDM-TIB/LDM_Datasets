To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Convergence Theory for Federated Average: Beyond Smoothness" by Xiaoxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** closely. This section often discusses the motivation behind the research and may reference datasets used in prior work or those that the authors plan to use. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will check the **related work section**. This section typically reviews existing literature and may include references to datasets that have been used in previous studies related to federated learning and the FedAvg algorithm. I will take note of any datasets mentioned here.

After that, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections usually provide detailed information about the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

If the paper discusses another dataset, such as **MNIST**, I would find its citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing complete citations for each.
