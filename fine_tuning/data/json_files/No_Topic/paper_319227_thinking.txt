To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Angle Diversity Transmitter For High Speed Data Center Uplink Communications" by Abrar S. Alhazmi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed uplink optical wireless communication (OWC) link design, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of data centers and the need for high data rates but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **system model** section, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In this case, the authors describe the data center structure and the optical transmitter and receiver designs, but they do not reference any specific datasets.

I will then look into the **results** section, where the authors present their findings based on simulations. They mention using a ray-tracing algorithm to analyze the performance of the proposed system, but again, there are no specific datasets cited.

Finally, I will check the **acknowledgments** and **references** sections for any datasets that might be indirectly referenced or cited through previous works. The references list includes various studies and papers, but it does not appear to include any datasets directly.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used in their research. Instead, they focused on theoretical models and simulations without referencing external datasets.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will note that there are no datasets to extract, and therefore, no citations to provide. This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of a research paper to ensure that all relevant information is captured, even if it turns out that no datasets are present.
