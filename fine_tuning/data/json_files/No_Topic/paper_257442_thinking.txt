To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PHASED: Phase-Aware Submodularity-Based Energy Disaggregation" by Faisal M. Almutairi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the task of energy disaggregation and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they state that they evaluate their method using two publicly available datasets: **REDD** and **ECO**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding the results of their research.

I will then look for a **dedicated datasets section** or any part of the paper where the datasets are described in detail. In the experiments section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **REDD Dataset**: This dataset contains data from 6 homes in the United States, with whole-home measurements consisting of power readings at two lines. The authors note that House 5 is omitted due to insufficient data.

2. **ECO Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 6 Swiss households, with a three-phase distribution system. They mention that House 3 is also omitted for the same reason as House 5 in the REDD dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **REDD Dataset**:
  > J. Z. Kolter and M. J. Johnson. "REDD: A public data set for energy disaggregation research." In Workshop on Data Mining Applications in Sustainability (SustKDD) in the 17th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, San Diego, CA, United States, Aug. 2011, pp. 59–62.

- For the **ECO Dataset**:
  > C. Beckel, W. Kleiminger, R. Cicchetti, T. Staake, and S. Santini. "The ECO data set and the performance of non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms." In Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Conference on Embedded Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings (BuildSys 2014), Memphis, TN, United States, Nov. 2014, pp. 80–89.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
