To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demand-Driven Incremental Object Queries" by Yanhong A. Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the **experiments section** is likely to contain information about the datasets utilized for testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that provide names, sizes, and characteristics of the datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are mentioned, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of data, and the context in which they were used. If the paper refers to datasets from other works, I will ensure to track down the original sources for proper citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Core RBAC" or "Django authorization query," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to format the citations correctly, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure completeness and accuracy before finalizing the dataset documentation.
