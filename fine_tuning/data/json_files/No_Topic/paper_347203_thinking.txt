To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recommendations for Systematic Research on Emergent Language" by Brendon Boldt and David Mortensen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the need for systematic research in emergent language but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on the goals and challenges of emergent language research without naming any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or methodologies, as these are likely to contain references to datasets. I will look for any mentions of datasets used in experiments or studies, especially in sections that describe empirical evaluations or benchmarks.

In the paper, I notice that there are references to various studies and methodologies, but no specific datasets are explicitly named. The authors mention several papers that discuss emergent language research, but they do not provide details about datasets used in those studies.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. I will look for papers that might have published datasets related to emergent language research. 

For example, I will check the references for papers like:
- Lazaridou & Baroni (2020)
- Evtimova et al. (2018)
- Li et al. (2020)

If any of these papers mention datasets, I will extract the relevant information and write down the full citations for those datasets.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year. If no datasets are found, I will note that the paper does not provide specific datasets for emergent language research.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
