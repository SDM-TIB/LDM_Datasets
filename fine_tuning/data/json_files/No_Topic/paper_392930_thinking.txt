To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TinyTrain: Resource-Aware Task-Adaptive Sparse Training of DNNs at the Data-Scarce Edge" by Young D. Kwon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the challenges of on-device training and mentions the use of various datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly in the **experimental setup** subsection, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, I will pay close attention to any specific dataset names, descriptions, and their relevance to the experiments conducted.

In the **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments, including performance metrics associated with each dataset. This will help confirm the datasets' roles in the study and their significance in evaluating the proposed method.

I will also consult the **appendices** for any additional details regarding datasets, as supplementary materials often contain valuable information that may not be included in the main text.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is used for meta-training and consists of 100 classes from ImageNet-1k, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

7. **Describable Textures Dataset (DTD)**: This dataset comprises 5,640 images organized into 47 texture categories.

10. **MSCOCO (COCO)**: This dataset is the train2017 split of the COCO dataset, containing images from Flickr with 1.5 million object instances of 80 classes.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
