To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mobility Mode Detection Using WiFi Signals" by Arash Kalatian and Bilal Farooq, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of Wi-Fi communications from smartphones to predict mobility modes, which indicates that data collection is involved. The introduction elaborates on the data collection methods, specifically mentioning the **URBANFlux system** and **OD Pod detectors** used to gather Wi-Fi signals from smartphones.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the specifics of the dataset. Here, they mention that data was collected from eight detectors installed in downtown Toronto, capturing MAC addresses and signal strengths from Wi-Fi enabled devices. They also provide details about the number of trips recorded for each mobility mode (walking, biking, driving), which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

The paper states that a total of **400 observations** were collected, with specific counts for each mode:
- Walking: 142 trips
- Biking: 108 trips
- Driving: 150 trips

This information confirms the existence of a dataset that is central to the research.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. The authors reference the URBANFlux system and cite a previous work by Farooq et al. (2015) that describes this system. I will extract the citation from the **References section** of the paper for the URBANFlux system:

- For the **URBANFlux system**, the citation is:

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: URBANFlux Wi-Fi Mobility Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of Wi-Fi signals collected from smartphones to predict mobility modes (walking, biking, driving) in downtown Toronto. It includes 400 observations with specific counts for each mode.
   - **Full Citation**: Bilal Farooq, Alexandra Beaulieu, Marwan Ragab, and Viet Dang Ba. *Ubiquitous monitoring of pedestrian dynamics: Exploring wireless ad hoc network of multi-sensor technologies*. In SENSORS, 2015 IEEE, pages 1–4. IEEE, 2015.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all dataset details and citations are accurately captured.
