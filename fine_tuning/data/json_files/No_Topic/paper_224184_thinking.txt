To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unpaired Image-to-Speech Synthesis with Multimodal Information Bottleneck" by Shuang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method using two existing datasets: one for image-text pairs and another for text-speech pairs. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is known for providing image-text pairs and is widely used in image captioning tasks. The authors reference it as a source for their image-to-speech synthesis experiments.

2. **EMT-4 Dataset**: This is an in-house dataset containing 22,377 American-English audio-text samples, totaling 24 hours of audio. It is specifically mentioned as the dataset providing text-speech pairs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. CoRR, abs/1504.00325, 2015.

- For the **EMT-4 Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note that it is described in the paper as containing audio-text samples.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and formatted appropriately.
