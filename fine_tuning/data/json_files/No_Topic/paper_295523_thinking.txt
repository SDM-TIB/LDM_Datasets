To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning for Topic Modeling" by Tomoharu Iwata, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate their method using "three real-world text document sets." This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Data)**, the author describes the three datasets:

1. **20News Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 20 Newsgroups corpus, which contains 14,366 documents and 20 categories. It is commonly used for text classification tasks.

2. **Digg Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Digg, a social news service, and consists of 3,859 documents across 23 categories.

3. **NeurIPS Dataset**: This dataset includes papers from the Conferences on Neural Information Processing Systems from 2001 to 2003, containing 592 documents and 13 categories.

The author also provides details about the preprocessing steps taken for each dataset, such as omitting documents with fewer than 30 vocabulary terms and vocabulary terms that appeared in fewer than 30 documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are commonly known and do not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide a general citation for the 20 Newsgroups corpus, which is widely recognized in the literature:

- For the **20 Newsgroups Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *International Conference on Machine Learning*, pages 331–339.

The Digg dataset and NeurIPS dataset do not have formal citations in the paper, but I can note that the NeurIPS dataset is often referenced in the context of the conference proceedings.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

1. **20News Dataset**: A collection of 14,366 documents across 20 categories, derived from the 20 Newsgroups corpus.
   - Citation: Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *International Conference on Machine Learning*, pages 331–339.

2. **Digg Dataset**: A dataset collected from the Digg social news service, containing 3,859 documents across 23 categories.

3. **NeurIPS Dataset**: A dataset comprising papers from the Conferences on Neural Information Processing Systems from 2001 to 2003, containing 592 documents across 13 categories.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
