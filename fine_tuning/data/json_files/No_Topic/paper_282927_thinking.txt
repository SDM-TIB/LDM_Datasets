To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence for Emotion-Semantic Trending and People Emotion Detection During COVID-19 Social Isolation" by Hamed Jelodar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a framework for emotion detection using Twitter data, which suggests that a dataset of tweets is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their data collection process. In **section 4.1**, they mention the creation of a dataset of tweets related to COVID-19 and the Stay-At-Home order. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of tweets collected over specific time periods.

The paper states that they collected tweets from April 28 to June 2, 2020, and provides a breakdown of the number of tweets processed during this time. The total number of tweets collected is **1,047,968**, which is a significant dataset for their analysis.

In **section 5**, the authors discuss the dataset further, emphasizing that they filtered the tweets to focus on those relevant to the Stay-At-Home order. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken to clean the data, which is crucial for ensuring the quality of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, in this case, the dataset is primarily composed of tweets collected by the authors, so there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **COVID-19 Tweets Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets collected from Twitter using the hashtag **#StayAtHome** during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset includes a total of **1,047,968 tweets** collected from April 28 to June 2, 2020. The authors filtered and processed these tweets to analyze emotional trends related to the pandemic.

Since the dataset is derived from Twitter data, I will note that the citation for the dataset is based on the authors' work and the specific time frame of data collection rather than a traditional dataset citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
