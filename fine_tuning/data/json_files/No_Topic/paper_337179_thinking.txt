To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Pneumatic Non-Prehensile Manipulation with a Mobile Blower" by Jimmy Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

As I read through the **experiments section**, I will note any datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments conducted. This section typically provides detailed information about how the datasets were utilized, including any variations or specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "PyBullet" for simulation environments, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is a well-known benchmark, I will ensure to find the original paper that introduced it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
