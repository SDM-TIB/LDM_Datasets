To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identification of Rhetorical Roles of Sentences in Indian Legal Judgments" by Paheli Bhattacharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors labeled sentences in 50 documents, which suggests that these documents form the basis of their dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. Here, they mention that they crawled legal judgments from the Supreme Court of India, specifically from the Thomson Reuters Westlaw India website. They state that they collected a total of 53,210 documents and then sampled 50 documents from the top five legal domains.

The specific details of the dataset are as follows:
1. **Supreme Court of India Judgments**: The dataset consists of 50 legal documents sampled from five different domains: Criminal, Land and Property, Constitutional, Labour and Industrial, and Intellectual Property Rights. The distribution of documents across these domains is also provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the source of the dataset. The authors mention that the documents were crawled from Thomson Reuters Westlaw India, but they do not provide a formal citation for this source in the references. However, I can note that the dataset is derived from publicly available legal judgments.

Since the dataset is based on a collection of documents rather than a standalone dataset published in a separate paper, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Supreme Court of India Judgments
- **Description**: A collection of 50 legal documents sampled from five different legal domains, including Criminal, Land and Property, Constitutional, Labour and Industrial, and Intellectual Property Rights.
- **Source**: Thomson Reuters Westlaw India (no formal citation available).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and source, ensuring that I maintain clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset used in the research.
