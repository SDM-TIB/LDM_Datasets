To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous UAV Navigation: A DDPG-based Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Omar Bouhamed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a framework for UAV navigation using deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this case, I will look for any references to specific datasets or environments that the authors used for their simulations.

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I find that the authors describe their simulations in a virtual 3D environment with randomly generated obstacles and targets. However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets that they used. Instead, they created their own simulation environment, which is common in research focused on specific applications like UAV navigation.

Since there are no external datasets referenced in the paper, I will note that the authors utilized a custom simulation environment for their experiments. This means I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none from external sources.

Finally, I will summarize my findings. The paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets; instead, it relies on a custom-built simulation environment for testing the UAV navigation framework. Therefore, I will document this information clearly, indicating that no external dataset citations are applicable.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings into a structured format, noting the absence of external datasets and the use of a custom simulation environment for the experiments described in the paper.
