To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the k-Boundedness for Existential Rules" by Stathis Delivorias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and any **subsequent sections** that might detail experiments or applications of the research.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experiments section** or any examples provided throughout the paper. If the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments or analyses, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of instances, types of data, or specific characteristics that define the datasets.

I will also check the **references section** of the paper for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial because the full citation is necessary for proper documentation. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider whether the authors discuss any theoretical constructs or frameworks that imply the use of datasets, and I will document these accordingly, even if they are not traditional datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as per the references provided in the paper. This will involve formatting the citations correctly and ensuring that they are attributed to the original authors.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is described with its corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
