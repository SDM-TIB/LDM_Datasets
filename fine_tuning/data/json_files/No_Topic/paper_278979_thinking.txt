To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAFFIRE: System for Autonomous Feature Filtering and Intelligent ROI Estimation" by Marco Boschi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its applications, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used to validate their framework. In this section, they describe several datasets along with the number of images available for each. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **StarCart**: A toy dataset used for testing, which includes images of a cart and a star.
2. **Cans**: Contains 87 images.
3. **Curry**: Contains 16 images.
4. **Tea**: Contains 31 images.
5. **Oil**: Contains 10 images.
6. **Pasta**: Contains 16 images.
7. **Juice**: Contains 139 images.
8. **Ciocor√¨**: Contains 35 images.
9. **LeadFrame**: Contains 11 images.
10. **Caprice**: Contains 29 images.
11. **Beer**: Contains 86 images.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, as they appear to be original datasets created for the study. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are described in the context of the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names and the number of images available for each. Since there are no external citations provided for these datasets, I will indicate that they are part of the study conducted by the authors.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
