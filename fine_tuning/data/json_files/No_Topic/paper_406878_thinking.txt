To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-Based Classification of Gamma Photon Interaction in Room-Temperature Semiconductor Radiation Detectors" by Sandeep K. Chaudhuri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a deep learning classifier (CoPhNet) trained on simulated data and validated with both simulated and experimental data. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of gamma-ray imaging and mentions the use of semiconductor detectors, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **method** section, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset preparation and generation)**, where the authors describe how they generated datasets for training and validation. Here, I find two main types of datasets:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: These datasets were generated using a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm. The authors mention that they created separate datasets for Compton scattering (CS) and photoelectric (PE) events, each containing tens of thousands of pulses.

2. **Experimental Dataset**: This dataset was obtained using a CZTS detector illuminated with 662 keV gamma rays. The authors describe the setup and parameters used for data acquisition, indicating that this dataset consists of 50,000 pulses.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a detailed description of the simulated and experimental datasets, including the number of pulses, sampling intervals, and interaction types. This table is crucial for understanding the specifics of each dataset.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are generated by the authors. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on the authors' simulations and experimental setups.

To summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Simulated Datasets**:
   - **Description**: Datasets generated for training and testing the CoPhNet model, including separate datasets for CS and PE events.
   - **Details**: Tens of thousands of pulses, with specific parameters outlined in Table 2.

2. **Experimental Dataset**:
   - **Description**: Dataset obtained from a CZTS detector using a 132Cs radioisotope emitting 662 keV gamma rays.
   - **Details**: 50,000 pulses, with specific acquisition parameters provided in the paper.

Since the datasets are not published in a separate repository or paper, I will note that they are available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for review or downstream processing, ensuring that I include the necessary details for each dataset.
