To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Model Explanations and Uncertainty Without Model Access" by Surin Ahn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "two real datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they applied their method to: the **COMPAS recidivism dataset** and the **German Credit dataset**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will help in documenting the datasets accurately.

For the **COMPAS recidivism dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, and Lauren Kirchner. *Machine bias*. In Ethics of Data and Analytics, pages 254â€“264. Auerbach Publications, 2016.

For the **German Credit dataset**, the citation is:
> Dheeru Dua, Casey Graff, et al. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
