To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent Method for Computing the Projection Robust Wasserstein Distance" by Minhui Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Results."** In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used in the **numerical results section**. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using both synthetic and real datasets. They describe the **Fragmented Hypercube** and **Gaussian Distribution** datasets in detail, including how they were generated and their characteristics. 

1. **Fragmented Hypercube Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a uniform distribution over a hypercube and is transformed using a specific mapping. The authors mention that the ground truth Wasserstein distance can be computed analytically.

2. **Gaussian Distribution Dataset**: The authors describe using Gaussian distributions with specific covariance matrices generated according to a Wishart distribution. They provide details on how the datasets are structured and the parameters used for generating them.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. If the datasets are original to the authors, I will note that as well.

For the **Fragmented Hypercube Dataset**, the citation is:
> The dataset is based on the work by [6] which discusses optimal transport maps.

For the **Gaussian Distribution Dataset**, the citation is:
> The dataset generation follows the methodology outlined in [21], which discusses the use of Gaussian distributions in optimal transport.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
