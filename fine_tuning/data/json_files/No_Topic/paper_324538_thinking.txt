To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimization of Stochastic First-Order Oracle Complexity of Adaptive Methods for Nonconvex Optimization" by Hideaki Iiduka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a summary of the research, and if datasets are used, they may be referenced here. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Nonconvex Optimization and Deep Learning Optimizers)** and **section 4 (Numerical Examples)**. These sections often describe the experiments conducted and the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **Numerical Examples section**, the author discusses the performance of various optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adam) on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used in the experiments. The paper mentions that the CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 training images and is commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is typically found in the literature, and I will ensure to include it accurately.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on sections that detail experiments and results for specific datasets.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references for any datasets mentioned.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
