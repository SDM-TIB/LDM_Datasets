To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning from strongly mixing observations: Sparse-penalized regularization and minimax optimality" by William Kengne and Modou Wade, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly named or described. For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset for training or testing their models, I will record the name and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics of the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will search for the original paper or source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
