To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Within-basket Recommendation via Neural Pattern Associator" by Tianshu Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their model across multiple extensive datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they conducted evaluations on three industry-scale benchmark datasets: **Instacart**, **Spotify**, and a **private industry dataset**. 

1. **Instacart Dataset**: This dataset is described as comprising approximately 50,000 grocery products and 3,000,000 orders, with contextual information about each product. The average length of baskets is noted as 14.08 items.

2. **Spotify Dataset**: The Spotify Million Playlist dataset consists of 1,000,000 playlists created by users, including track metadata and the position of tracks in the playlists.

3. **Private Industry Dataset**: This dataset comes from a large North American food retailer and contains baskets with at least 11 items and no more than 40 items.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely well-known datasets in the field. Therefore, I will provide the citations based on common knowledge:

- For the **Instacart Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Instacart. *Instacart Market Basket Analysis*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.

- For the **Spotify Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Spotify. *Spotify Million Playlist Dataset*. Available at: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge.

- For the **Private Industry Dataset**, since it is proprietary, I will note that it is not publicly available and cannot be cited.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations as identified above.
