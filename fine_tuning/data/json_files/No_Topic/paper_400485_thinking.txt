To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-automatic staging area for high-quality structured data extraction from scientific literature" by Luca Foppiano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of a database called **SuperCon2**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for a more efficient approach to sustain productivity in updating the **SuperCon** database, indicating that both **SuperCon** and **SuperCon2** are significant datasets in the context of their research.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the **SuperCon2 Database**, which contains around 40,000 entries of experimental records. This is a clear indication that **SuperCon2** is a primary dataset used in their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the original **SuperCon** database, which was built manually and is considered a reliable source of experimental data on superconductors. The citation for the SuperCon database is:

- For **SuperCon**:
  > Ishii M, Sakamoto K. *Structuring superconductor data with ontology: reproducing historical datasets as knowledge bases*. Science and Technology of Advanced Materials: Methods. 2023;3(1):2223051. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1080/27660400.2023.2223051.

The **SuperCon2 Database** is mentioned as a new dataset created through an automated process, but it does not have a separate citation since it is part of the ongoing work by the authors. However, I will note that it is derived from the original SuperCon database.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **SuperCon Database**: A manually built database of superconductors containing experimental data.
2. **SuperCon2 Database**: An automated database of superconductors containing around 40,000 entries, created to enhance the existing SuperCon database.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
