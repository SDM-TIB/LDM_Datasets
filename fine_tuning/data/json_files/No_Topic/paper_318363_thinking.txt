To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Efficient Learning of Complexly Structured Preferences: Elicitation Procedures and Their Application to Decision Making Under Uncertainty" by C. Jansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or data collection. This section often contains detailed descriptions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for specific phrases that indicate the presence of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "the data was collected from."

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. They may provide additional context or results related to the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier used by the authors.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, features, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
