To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessment of mobility deficit and treatment efficacy in adhesive capsulitis by measurement of kinematic parameters using IMU sensors" by Miloš Ajčević et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aim and methodology, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of IMU sensors for assessing mobility deficits in patients with adhesive capsulitis. They mention that the study involves a comparison between patients with adhesive capsulitis and healthy controls, which suggests that there are datasets related to these two groups.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe the study population. They enrolled **6 patients with adhesive capsulitis (AC)** and **7 healthy controls (HC)**. This indicates that there are two distinct datasets: one for the AC patients and one for the HC group. The authors also mention the use of kinematic parameters measured through IMU sensors, which implies that the data collected includes specific measurements related to shoulder mobility.

In the **results section**, the authors present tables that summarize the range of motion (ROM) data for both groups. For instance, Table I shows the range of motion in elevation and abduction for AC patients at baseline and post-treatment, while Table II presents similar data for healthy controls. This reinforces the existence of two datasets: one for the AC group and one for the HC group, each containing kinematic measurements.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or protocols mentioned. The authors refer to the ISEO protocol, which is crucial for understanding the methodology used for data collection. The relevant citation for the ISEO protocol is:

- Cutti, A. G., Giovanardi, A., Rocchi, L., Davalli, A., & Sacchetti, R. (2008). Ambulatory measurement of shoulder and elbow kinematics through inertial and magnetic sensors. *Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing*, 46(2), 169-178.

Additionally, the authors reference other studies that may provide context or validation for their findings, but the primary datasets are the measurements taken from the AC patients and HC controls.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets and protocols used in the study. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the data collected in this research.
