To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Nested MLMC for Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation with Intractable Likelihoods" by Xiliang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors likely describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. For example, if the authors mention using specific simulation models or benchmark datasets, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Lotka-Volterra model**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I may also cross-reference it with existing literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
