To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tulu Resource for Machine Translation" by Manu Narayanan and Noëmi Aepli, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present the first parallel dataset for English-Tulu translation, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The 1st Dataset for Tulu MT)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the dataset they created. They mention extending the **FLORES-200** dataset with human translations into Tulu. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes:

1. **FLORES-200**: This dataset is crucial as it serves as the foundation for the English-Tulu translations. The authors mention that it contains 2009 sentences for each language.

2. **Samanantar**: This dataset is used for training the English-Kannada translation model and contains 4,093,524 sentences.

3. **DravidianLangTech-22**: This dataset includes 8,300 sentences for Kannada-Tulu translation, which is also relevant for the English-Tulu translation task.

4. **Tulu Wikipedia**: The authors mention using the Tulu Wikipedia as a monolingual dataset, which contains 40,124 sentences.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **FLORES-200**, the citation is:
  > Piyushi Goyal, Musica Supriya, Dinesh U, and Ashalatha Nayak. *Translation techies @DravidianLangTech-ACL2022-machine translation in Dravidian languages*. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Speech and Language Technologies for Dravidian Languages, pages 120–124, Dublin, Ireland, 2022.

- For **Samanantar**, the citation is:

- For **DravidianLangTech-22**, the citation is:
  > Anand Kumar Madasamy, Asha Hegde, Shubhanker Banerjee, Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, Ruba Priyadharshini, Hosahalli Shashirekha, and John McCrae. *Overview of the shared task on machine translation in Dravidian languages*.

- For **Tulu Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia. *Tulu Wikipedia — Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tulu%20Wikipedia&oldid=1157462605. [Online; accessed 29-May-2023].

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
