To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Probabilistic Label Trees" by Kalina Jasinska-Kobus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **Section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of samples, labels, and features.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a table (Table 1) that lists several datasets used for the experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **AmazonCat**: 
   - Ntrain: 1,186,239
   - Ntest: 306,782
   - m (number of labels): 13,330
   - Citation: Bhatia, K., Dahiya, K., Jain, H., Mittal, A., Prabhu, Y., and Varma, M. (2016). The extreme classification repository: Multi-label datasets and code.

2. **Wiki10**: 
   - Ntrain: 14,146
   - Ntest: 6,616
   - m: 30,938
   - Citation: Bhatia, K., Dahiya, K., Jain, H., Mittal, A., Prabhu, Y., and Varma, M. (2016). The extreme classification repository: Multi-label datasets and code.

3. **WikiLSHTC**: 
   - Ntrain: 1,778,351
   - Ntest: 587,084
   - m: 325,056

4. **Amazon**: 
   - Ntrain: 490,449
   - Ntest: 153,025
   - m: 670,091
   - Citation: Bhatia, K., Dahiya, K., Jain, H., Mittal, A., Prabhu, Y., and Varma, M. (2016). The extreme classification repository: Multi-label datasets and code.

5. **ALOI**: 
   - Ntrain: 97,200
   - Ntest: 10,800
   - m: 1,001
   - Citation: Geusebroek, J.-M., Burghouts, G., and Smeulders, A. (2005). The Amsterdam Library of Object Images. Int. J. Comput. Vision, 61(1):103–112.

6. **WikiPara-S**: 
   - Ntrain: S × 10,000 (where S is the number of shots)
   - Ntest: 10,000
   - Citation: Bhatia, K., Dahiya, K., Jain, H., Mittal, A., Prabhu, Y., and Varma, M. (2016). The extreme classification repository: Multi-label datasets and code.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to compile their details along with the full citations as provided in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its characteristics and citation for future reference or analysis.
