To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAIS: Supervising and Augmenting Intermediate Steps for Document-Level Relation Extraction" by Yuxin Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: **DocRED, CDR, and GDA**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors state that their method outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks, which suggests that they will provide more details about these datasets later in the paper.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will find specific details about each dataset used. The authors mention:

1. **DocRED**: A large-scale crowd-sourced dataset based on Wikipedia articles, consisting of 97 relation types, seven entity types, and 5,053 documents.
2. **CDR**: A biomedical dataset that studies binary interactions between disease and chemical concepts, containing 1,500 documents.
3. **GDA**: Another biomedical dataset that examines binary relationships between gene and disease, with 30,192 documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the context of the datasets.

- For **DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Yao, Y., Ye, D., Li, P., Han, X., Lin, Y., Liu, Z., Huang, L., Zhou, J., & Sun, M. (2019). DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 764â€“774.

- For **CDR**, the citation is:
  > Li, J., Ye, Z., Sheng, Q., Xie, Y., Xi, X., & Zhang, S. (2016). Biocreative v cdr task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction. Database.

- For **GDA**, the citation is:
  > Wu, H., Luo, R., Leung, H. C. M., Ting, H.-F., & Lam, T.-W. (2019). Renet: A deep learning approach for extracting gene-disease associations from literature. In RECOMB.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
