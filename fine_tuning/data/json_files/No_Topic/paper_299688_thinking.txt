To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Fixed Ballot Rules and Hybrid Domains" by Shurojit Chatterji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors discuss the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that help define them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, number of samples, and any relevant features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its details and citation.

Now, I will proceed to read the paper carefully, focusing on the sections mentioned above to extract the necessary information about the datasets.
