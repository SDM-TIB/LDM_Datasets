To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Generalization of Meta-learning on Unseen Domains via Adversarial Shift" by Pinzhuo Tian and Yang Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they explicitly mention using five datasets for their experiments: **mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, ISIC, and ChestX**. I will take note of these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail:
1. **mini-ImageNet**: A dataset commonly used for few-shot learning tasks, consisting of images from 64 training categories.
2. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: A dataset containing images of birds, often used for fine-grained classification tasks.
3. **Cars**: A dataset that includes images of various car models, also used for classification tasks.
4. **ISIC**: A dataset that contains dermoscopic images of skin lesions, used for medical image classification.
5. **ChestX**: A dataset consisting of chest X-ray images, used for diagnosing thoracic diseases.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **mini-ImageNet**:

- For **CUB**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
