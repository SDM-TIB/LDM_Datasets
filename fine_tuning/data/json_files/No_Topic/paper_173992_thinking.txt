To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unperturbed: spectral analysis beyond Davis-Kahan" by Justin Eldridge, Mikhail Belkin, and Yusu Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work and may mention datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in detail in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes information about the datasets' characteristics, such as size, type, and any preprocessing steps taken.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the analysis. Authors may refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results to previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. I will also check the **references section** of the paper for full citations of the datasets. This is crucial, as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not present, I may need to conduct a quick search to find the original source of the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced later.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or experimental setup.
3. Check results and discussion sections for additional references to datasets.
4. Note down dataset names and details.
5. Consult the references section for full citations or search for them if not provided.
6. Compile the information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper citations.
