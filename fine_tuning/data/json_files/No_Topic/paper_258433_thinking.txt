To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factorizable Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yiding Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Experimental setups)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of a fixed number of predefined graphs used as factor graphs. The authors mention that it is generated by selecting well-known graph types and padding them with isolated nodes.

2. **ZINC Dataset**: This dataset is built from molecular graphs and is referenced with a citation to the original work by Jin et al. (2018).

3. **Pattern Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset for node classification tasks, also referenced with a citation to the original work by Dwivedi et al. (2020).

4. **COLLAB Dataset**: A widely used graph classification dataset that represents social networks, cited from Yanardag and Vishwanathan (2015).

5. **IMDB-B Dataset**: Another graph classification dataset related to social networks, also cited from Yanardag and Vishwanathan (2015).

6. **MUTAG Dataset**: A bioinformatics graph classification dataset, again cited from Yanardag and Vishwanathan (2015).

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **ZINC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wengong Jin, Regina Barzilay, and Tommi Jaakkola. *Junction tree variational autoencoder for molecular graph generation*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2323–2332, 2018.

- For the **Pattern Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Chaitanya K Joshi, Thomas Laurent, Yoshua Bengio, and Xavier Bresson. *Benchmarking graph neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00982, 2020.

- For the **COLLAB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pinar Yanardag and SVN Vishwanathan. *Deep graph kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1365–1374, 2015.

- For the **IMDB-B Dataset**, the citation is the same as for COLLAB since both datasets are from the same source.

- For the **MUTAG Dataset**, the citation is also the same as for COLLAB since it is included in the same reference.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
