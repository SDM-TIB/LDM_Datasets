To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Collaborative Learning for Prostate 3D MR Image Segmentation" by Yousuf Babiker M. Osman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "publicly available prostate MR image dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find its name.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors mention using the **MICCAI Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge dataset**. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PROMISE12 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PROMISE12 dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Litjens, et al., “Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: The PROMISE12 challenge,” Medical Image Analysis, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 359-373, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MICCAI Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 3D MR images collected from multiple hospitals using various equipment and protocols.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
