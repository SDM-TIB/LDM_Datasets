To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-pixel 3D imaging based on fusion temporal data of single photon detector and millimeter-wave radar" by Tingqin Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any established datasets or benchmarks that their work builds upon. This section often highlights the context of the research and may include citations to relevant datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the data collection process. The authors may describe the datasets they created or used, including any specific parameters, conditions, or configurations relevant to the experiments.

The **experimental results section** is crucial as it often includes references to datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that explicitly mention datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is essential for providing accurate and complete references for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the following details for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the final output is comprehensive and useful for further research or application.
