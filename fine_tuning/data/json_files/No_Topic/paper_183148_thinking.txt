To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Untrimmed Video Classification for Activity Detection" by Gurkirt Singh and Fabio Cuzzolin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors' method won a runner-up prize in the ActivityNet Detection challenge, which suggests that they likely used the ActivityNet dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. They discuss the need for an all-round approach to human behavior understanding, which may lead to specific datasets being referenced.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 2.1**, the authors mention using features provided on ActivityNet's web page. This indicates that the ActivityNet dataset is indeed utilized in their work.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the use of the ActivityNet dataset. The authors report results for untrimmed classification and activity detection on ActivityNet, further solidifying its role in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ActivityNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ActivityNet**:
  > F. Caba Heilbron, V. Escorcia, B. Ghanem, and J. Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961â€“970, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the ActivityNet dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for ActivityNet, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for structured output or further processing.
