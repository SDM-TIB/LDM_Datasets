To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial effects in meta-foodwebs" by Edmund Barter and Thilo Gross, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any references to datasets or data sources. The abstract does not mention any specific datasets, but it discusses the concept of meta-foodwebs and their spatial dynamics, which may imply the use of data related to ecological networks.

Next, I will examine the **methods and model sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their simulations or analyses. In this case, the authors discuss the use of Erdős-Rényi and random geometric networks as models for their study, but they do not specify any datasets that were used for empirical validation or analysis.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any mention of datasets. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical models and simulations rather than empirical data collection. The authors do not provide any specific datasets or data sources in these sections either.

Finally, I will look at the **data availability section** and the **references** to see if any datasets are cited. The data availability section states that "this study did not involve any underlying data," which confirms that no datasets were used or referenced in this paper.

Since there are no datasets mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the methods and model sections for any data sources.
3. Checking the results and discussion sections for empirical data references.
4. Reviewing the data availability section and references for any dataset citations.

Ultimately, I found that the paper does not include any datasets, so there are no citations to provide.
