To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inductive Bias and Language Expressivity in Emergent Communication" by Shangmin Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical experiments on a **handcrafted symbolic dataset**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about datasets in the **background** and **experiments** sections. In the background, the authors discuss the types of games used in their experiments but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention that they hand-crafted a dataset consisting of one-hot vectors, which is crucial information.

In the **appendices**, I will check for any additional details about the dataset configuration. The paper states that they created a dataset with 216 samples, split into a training set of 173 samples and a test set of 43 samples. This is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Handcrafted Symbolic Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of one-hot vectors, with a total of 216 samples, split into training and test sets. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is a custom dataset created by the authors.

Since there are no external datasets referenced in the paper, I will focus on the one dataset mentioned. I will note that the dataset is not formally published elsewhere, so it does not have a traditional citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its origin.

In conclusion, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **Handcrafted Symbolic Dataset**, which is an original dataset created by the authors for their experiments. I will ensure to document this appropriately in the final output.
