To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Recommendation System to Enhance Midwivesâ€™ Capacities in Low-Income Countries" by Anna Guitart et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract highlights the use of behavioral logs from the Safe Delivery App, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for the study.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Modeling)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of user behavioral logs collected from the Safe Delivery App, specifically from 21,296 users in India and 1,486 users in Ethiopia, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to September 1, 2021. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and context.

I will also check the **acknowledgments** and **references** sections to find any additional information about the dataset or its source. The authors acknowledge that all data comes from the Safe Delivery App logs, which is developed by the Maternity Foundation. This indicates that the dataset is proprietary and associated with the organization.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the Safe Delivery App in the references section. The relevant citation is:

- **Safe Delivery App**: Maternity Foundation. Safe delivery app, 2021. Accessed: 2021-09-03.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Safe Delivery App Behavioral Logs
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of user behavioral logs collected from the Safe Delivery App, which includes data from 21,296 users in India and 1,486 users in Ethiopia, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to September 1, 2021. The logs contain implicit feedback information on page views, clicks, and sequences of checked items related to various learning modules and drug information.
   - **Full Citation**: Maternity Foundation. Safe delivery app, 2021. Accessed: 2021-09-03.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
