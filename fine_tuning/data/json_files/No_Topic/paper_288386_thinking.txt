To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology Applied to Machine Learning" by Henry Adams and Michael Moy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss examples and applications**. The abstract mentions the evolution of applied topology and its applications, which may hint at datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors discuss various applications of persistent homology, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in those applications.

In the **examples section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors refer to the cyclo-octane dataset, which is described in detail. They mention that this dataset consists of **1,031,644 cyclo-octane conformations** and provide context on how it was generated and used in their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the cyclo-octane dataset, the citation is:
> Shawn Martin and Jean-Paul Watson. *Non-manifold surface reconstruction from high-dimensional point cloud data*. Computational Geometry, 44:427â€“441, 2011.

Additionally, I will look for other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those related to collective motion, brain artery trees, and hexagonal lattices. Each of these applications may reference specific datasets that need to be documented.

For example, the paper discusses the use of persistent homology in analyzing datasets related to **biological aggregation models** and **brain artery trees**. I will extract the relevant details and citations for these datasets as well.

Once I have identified all datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examining the examples and applications sections for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Collecting full citations from the references section for each identified dataset.
4. Compiling the information systematically for clarity and completeness.
