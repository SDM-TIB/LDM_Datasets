To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IACN: Influence-aware and Attention-based Co-evolutionary Network for Recommendation" by Shalini Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of recommendation systems and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four public datasets:

1. **Wikipedia dataset**: This dataset consists of one month of edits made on Wikipedia pages, containing 1000 items and 10,000 most active users, resulting in 672,447 interactions.

2. **Reddit post dataset**: This dataset includes one month of posts made by users, with 1000 most active Reddit posts and users who made at least 5 posts on these selected posts, resulting in 13,840 users and 121,258 interactions.

3. **Yelp review dataset**: Obtained from the Yelp dataset challenge, this dataset includes the top 1000 businesses with the most reviews and users who made at least 5 reviews, resulting in 5,325 users and 110,839 interactions.

4. **StackOverflow dataset**: This dataset was gathered from the StackOverflow website, including users who made at least 5 posts, resulting in 4,125 users and 20,719 posts.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For the **Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia Data Dumps*. Available at: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps.

- For the **Reddit post dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pushshift. *Reddit Dataset*. Available at: http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/.

- For the **Yelp review dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.

- For the **StackOverflow dataset**, the citation is:
  > Internet Archive. *StackExchange Data*. Available at: https://archive.org/details/stackexchange.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
