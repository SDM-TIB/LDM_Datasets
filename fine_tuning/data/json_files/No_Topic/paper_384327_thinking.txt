To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEMORIZATION FOR GOOD: ENCRYPTION WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE LANGUAGE MODELS" by Samuel Stevens and Yu Su, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they encrypt news articles from the **XSum dataset** (Narayan et al., 2018) truncated at 100 tokens. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **background or related work sections**. In this case, the authors discuss various domains from which they sample data, including **PubMed abstracts**, **random words**, and **random bytes**. However, these are not formal datasets but rather types of data used for experimentation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the **XSum dataset**:

- For **XSum dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium, October-November 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/D18-1206. URL https://aclanthology.org/D18-1206.

Since the paper does not mention any other formal datasets with full citations, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **XSum dataset**, and I will ensure to include the full citation for it in my final output.
