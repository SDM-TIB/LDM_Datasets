To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Concurrent Spatial and Channel ‘Squeeze & Excitation’ in Fully Convolutional Networks" by Abhijit Guha Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two applications: whole brain segmentation on MRI scans and organ segmentation on whole body contrast-enhanced CT scans. This suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used two datasets:

1. **Multi-Atlas Labelling Challenge (MALC) dataset**: This dataset is part of OASIS and consists of 15 scans for training and 15 scans for testing. The authors mention that manual segmentations for MALC were provided by Neuromorphometrics, Inc.

2. **Visceral dataset**: This dataset is used for segmenting 10 organs on whole-body contrast-enhanced CT scans. The authors specify that they trained on 65 scans from the silver corpus and tested on 20 scans with manual annotations from the gold corpus.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MALC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B., Warfield, S., Miccai Workshop on Multiatlas Labeling. *In MICCAI Grand Challenge*, 2012.

- For the **Visceral dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jimenez-del-Toro, O., et al. *Cloud-based evaluation of anatomical structure segmentation and landmark detection algorithms: VISCERAL anatomy benchmarks*. IEEE TMI, 35(11), pp.2459-2475, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
