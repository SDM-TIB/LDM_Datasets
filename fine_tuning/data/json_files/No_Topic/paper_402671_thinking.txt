To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual mode multispectral imaging system for food and agricultural product quality estimation" by Darsha Udayanga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the imaging system using standard color palettes and specific case studies on food samples, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe two case studies that serve as datasets:

1. **Turmeric Adulteration Dataset**: This dataset consists of 81 powdery samples of turmeric adulterated with varying amounts of rice flour (0% to 40% by weight) and 81 corresponding dissolved samples. The dataset is used to validate the imaging system's capabilities in both reflectance and transmittance modes.

2. **Coconut Oil Adulteration Dataset**: This dataset includes 72 liquid samples of coconut oil adulterated with varying proportions of palm oil (0% to 40% by volume). This dataset is used to assess the performance of the transmittance mode of the imaging system.

I will also check the **results** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for validation and analysis, which they were, as the authors report classification accuracies for both case studies.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a previous study for the turmeric adulteration dataset:

- For the **Turmeric Adulteration Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. G. Chaminda Bandara, G. W. Kasun Prabhath, D. W. Sahan Chinthana Bandara Dissanayake, V. R. Herath, G. M. Roshan Indika Godaliyadda, M. P. Bandara Ekanayake, D. Demini, and T. Madhujith. *Validation of multispectral imaging for the detection of selected adulterants in turmeric samples*. Journal of Food Engineering, vol. 266, p. 109700, 2020.

For the **Coconut Oil Adulteration Dataset**, the paper does not provide a specific citation, but it is implied that the dataset is part of the authors' own experimental work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the turmeric dataset and note the coconut oil dataset as part of the authors' original research.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper.
