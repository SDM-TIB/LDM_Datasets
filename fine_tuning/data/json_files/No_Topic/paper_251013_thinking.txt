To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is important about the No Free Lunch theorems?" by David H. Wolpert, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the implications of the No Free Lunch theorems but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of the theorems without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or applications of the No Free Lunch theorems. I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or analyses. However, the paper primarily discusses theoretical implications and does not provide specific datasets or empirical results that rely on datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references primarily consist of theoretical papers and discussions surrounding the No Free Lunch theorems, with no direct mention of datasets.

Given that no datasets are explicitly identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document them with full citations, following the format used in the references.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that it does not contain any datasets to extract or cite. If datasets were present, I would have followed the steps of identifying them in the relevant sections, confirming their usage in experiments, and retrieving full citations from the references.
