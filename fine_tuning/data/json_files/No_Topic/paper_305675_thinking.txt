To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wireless Indoor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface" by Ziang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that the authors utilized in their experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss a simulation scenario involving an indoor SLAM system. They mention the use of a **reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)** and various parameters related to the SLAM system, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. Often, datasets are referenced in the context of previous works or benchmarks that the current study builds upon.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about any identified datasets. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they appear in the references section.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Indoor SLAM Dataset" or any other specific dataset, I will extract the citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
