To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consequences and Factors of Stylistic Differences in Human-Robot Dialogue" by Stephanie M. Lukin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it discusses the analysis of stylistic differences in dialogue, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors reference a corpus of human-robot dialogue collected from a collaborative task. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being used, but I need to find its name and details.

In **section 4 (Human-Robot Dialogue Corpus)**, the authors describe the corpus in detail. They mention that the corpus contains 60 dialogues from 20 participants, which were collected during a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. This section confirms the existence of a dataset, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation.

The authors reference the corpus as being collected from a study by Marge et al. (2017). I will look for the full citation of this study in the **References section** to ensure I have the complete information.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Matthew Marge, Claire Bonial, Ashley Foots, Cory Hayes, Cassidy Henry, Kimberly Pollard, Ron Artstein, Clare Voss, and David Traum. *Exploring Variation of Natural Human Commands to a Robot in a Collaborative Navigation Task*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Language Grounding for Robotics, pages 58â€“66, 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention other related datasets in the **Related Work** section, such as TeamTalk and SCARE. I will also extract these references to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets mentioned in the paper.

The citations for these datasets are:
- For **TeamTalk**:
  > Matthew Marge and Alexander Rudnicky. *The TeamTalk Corpus: Route Instructions in Open Spaces*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Grounding Human-Robot Dialog for Spatial Tasks, 2011.

- For **SCARE**:
  > Laura Stoia, Darla Magdalena Shockley, Donna K Byron, and Eric Fosler-Lussier. *SCARE: a Situated Corpus with Annotated Referring Expressions*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
