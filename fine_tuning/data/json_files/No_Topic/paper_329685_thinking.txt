To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stratification of carotid atheromatous plaque using interpretable deep learning methods on B-mode ultrasound images" by Theofanis Ganitidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of early diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis and the role of ultrasound images, but I need to look for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their study, which includes sequences of B-mode ultrasound images from patients referred to Attikon General University Hospital. They mention the number of patients, the classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and the total number of videos analyzed. This section is crucial as it provides the specifics of the dataset.

The dataset consists of:
- **74 videos** in total, with **58 corresponding to asymptomatic patients** and **16 to symptomatic patients**. The authors also note that some patients had multiple videos, which adds complexity to the dataset description.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific dataset citation, but it mentions that the data was collected from a clinical setting, which may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I can still note the institutional source of the dataset.

The relevant citation for the paper itself is:
> Theofanis Ganitidis, Maria Athanasiou, Kalliopi Dalakleidi, Nikos Melanitis, Spyretta Golemati, and Konstantina S. Nikita. *Stratification of carotid atheromatous plaque using interpretable deep learning methods on B-mode ultrasound images*. IEEE, 2021.

Since the dataset is derived from a clinical study, I will note that it is not a publicly available dataset but rather a proprietary dataset collected under institutional review board approval.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the citation for the paper and the details about the dataset as described in the methods section. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
