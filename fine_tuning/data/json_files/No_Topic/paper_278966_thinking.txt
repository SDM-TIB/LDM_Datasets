To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EVRNet: Efficient Video Restoration on Edge Devices" by Sachin Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and it mentions the use of the **Vimeo-90K dataset** for evaluating the performance of EVRNet on video restoration tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Set-up)**, they explicitly state that they used the **Vimeo-90K dataset**, which consists of about 90,000 independent and diverse video shots. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Vimeo-90K dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tianfan Xue, Baian Chen, Jiajun Wu, Donglai Wei, and William T Freeman. *Video enhancement with task-oriented flow*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(8):1106â€“1125, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the Vimeo-90K dataset for various video restoration tasks (deblocking, denoising, and super-resolution), I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Vimeo-90K dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset extracted from this paper, as it is the primary dataset used for evaluation.

After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
