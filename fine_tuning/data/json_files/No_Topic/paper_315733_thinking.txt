To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey On Neural Word Embeddings" by Erhan Sezerer and Selma Tekir, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the introduction discusses the importance of benchmark datasets in evaluating word embeddings, which indicates that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, there is a section titled **5.1 Datasets** that categorizes the datasets into similarity tasks, analogy tasks, synonym selection tasks, and downstream tasks. This section will be crucial for identifying the datasets used in the research.

Within section 5.1, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **WordSim-353 (WS-353)**: This dataset contains human judgments on the similarity of 353 pairs of words.
   - Citation: Finkelstein et al. (2001). "Placing Search in Context: The Concept Revisited." In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW ’01). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 406–414.

2. **SCWS**: A dataset introduced by Huang et al. that scores word pairs within a context.
   - Citation: Huang et al. (2012). "Improving Word Representations via Global Context and Multiple Word Prototypes." In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers - Volume 1 (ACL ’12). Association for Computational Linguistics, Stroudsburg, PA, USA, 873–882.

3. **RG-65**: A dataset composed of 65 noun pairs rated for similarity.
   - Citation: Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965). "Contextual Correlates of Synonymy." Commun. ACM 8, 10 (Oct. 1965), 627–633.

4. **MC-30**: Contains 30 pairs of words.
   - Citation: The original source is not provided in the paper.

5. **MEN**: A dataset containing 3000 pairs of words with human-assigned similarity scores.
   - Citation: Bruni et al. (2014). "Multimodal Distributional Semantics." J. Artif. Int. Res. 49, 1 (Jan. 2014), 1–47.

6. **YP-130**: Similar to previous datasets, it contains human-assigned similarity scores for 130 word pairs.
   - Citation: The original source is not provided in the paper.

7. **RW**: A dataset consisting of 2034 pairs of rare words.
   - Citation: The original source is not provided in the paper.

8. **Simlex-999**: Contains 999 pairs of words annotated for similarity.
   - Citation: Hill et al. (2015). "SimLex-999: Evaluating Semantic Models With (Genuine) Similarity Estimation." Computational Linguistics 41, 4 (Dec. 2015), 665–695.

Next, I will also check the **downstream tasks** section (5.1.4) for additional datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **GLUE benchmark dataset**: A multi-task benchmark for evaluating NLP models.
   - Citation: Wang et al. (2018). "GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding." In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP. Association for Computational Linguistics, Brussels, Belgium, 353–355.

2. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: A reading comprehension dataset.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar et al. (2016). "SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text." In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics, Austin, Texas, 2383–2392.

3. **RACE dataset**: A reading comprehension dataset from English exams.
   - Citation: Lai et al. (2017). "RACE: Large-scale ReAding Comprehension Dataset From Examinations." In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics, Copenhagen, Denmark, 785–794.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
