To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D-aCortex" by M. Bavandpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or discussed. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the contributions and could mention specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant metrics. If the paper does not have a clearly labeled section, I will search through the **methods** or **results** sections for mentions of datasets.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any specific details provided by the authors. If the authors refer to datasets by abbreviations or acronyms, I will ensure to clarify what these stand for.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For each dataset, I will gather the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
