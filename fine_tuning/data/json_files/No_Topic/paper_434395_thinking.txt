To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OmniDrive: A Holistic LLM-Agent Framework for Autonomous Driving with 3D Perception, Reasoning and Planning" by Shihao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new benchmark called **OmniDrive-nuScenes**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (OmniDrive-nuScenes)**, where the authors describe this benchmark in detail. They state that OmniDrive-nuScenes is built on the **nuScenes** dataset and features high-quality visual question-answering (QA) pairs covering perception, reasoning, and planning in a 3D domain. This indicates that the nuScenes dataset is a foundational dataset for their work.

In this section, the authors also describe the **data generation pipeline** for creating QA pairs, which further emphasizes the use of the nuScenes dataset. They mention that the benchmark includes various tasks that require understanding of 3D spatial relationships, which is a critical aspect of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **nuScenes**:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A.H., Vora, S., Liong, V.E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., Beijbom, O. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Since the OmniDrive-nuScenes benchmark is built on the nuScenes dataset, I will ensure to include this citation when documenting the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The key datasets identified are:

1. **nuScenes**: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving that serves as the foundation for the OmniDrive-nuScenes benchmark.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
