To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Prompt Personalization for Recommendation with Large Language Models" by Wenyu Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three public datasets:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset contains 1 million ratings given by users on movies. It is widely used in recommendation system research.

2. **Games**: This dataset consists of user reviews and ratings for various video games available on the Amazon platform.

3. **Lastfm**: This dataset includes user listening histories, profiles, artist names, and track names.

In the same section, the authors provide detailed statistics about each dataset, confirming their relevance for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19:1–19:19, 2016.

- For **Games**, the citation is:
  > Vadim Borisov, Kathrin Seßler, Tobias Leemann, Martin Pawelczyk, and Gjergji Kasneci. *Language Models are Realistic Tabular Data Generators*. In ICLR, 2023.

- For **Lastfm**, the citation is:
  > Iván Cantador, Peter Brusilovsky, and Tsvi Kuflik. *Second workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (HetRec2011)*. In RecSys, 2011.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
