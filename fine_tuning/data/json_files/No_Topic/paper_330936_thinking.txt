To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Network-Driven Detection of Adversarial Tasks in Mobile Crowdsensing" by Zhiyan Chen and Burak Kantarci, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on detecting adversarial tasks in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) systems, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the vulnerabilities of MCS systems and mentions the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to **section III (Numerical Results and Analyses)**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors state that the dataset used in the study is generated via a realistic MCS simulator called **CrowdSenSim**. They mention that a total of 14,484 tasks were generated, with a breakdown of 12,587 legitimate tasks and 1,897 illegitimate (fake) tasks. This section also describes the features of the tasks generated, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the **training and test datasets**, indicating that the training dataset includes 1,506 fake sensing tasks and 10,081 legitimate tasks, while the test dataset contains 391 fake sensing tasks and 2,506 legitimate tasks. This information is essential for accurately describing the datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CrowdSenSim simulator, which is the source of the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CrowdSenSim**:
  > C. F. et al, “CrowdSenSim: a simulation platform for mobile crowd-sensing in urban environments,” IEEE Access, vol. 5, pp. 3490–3503, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CrowdSenSim simulator as the source of the dataset.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as follows:

1. **CrowdSenSim Dataset**: A dataset generated via the CrowdSenSim simulator, containing a total of 14,484 tasks (12,587 legitimate and 1,897 illegitimate). The training dataset consists of 1,506 fake sensing tasks and 10,081 legitimate tasks, while the test dataset includes 391 fake sensing tasks and 2,506 legitimate tasks.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
