To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning Approach for Lifetime Prediction of Semiconductor Lasers" by Khouloud Abdelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a federated learning framework for laser lifetime prediction, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 2.3 (Experimental data)**, the authors describe the dataset used for validation. They mention that the dataset consists of **3,397 samples** derived from accelerated aging tests performed on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the parameters monitored (output power, degradation parameters, temperature, and laser current) and the conditions under which the data was collected.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the source of the VCSEL reliability data. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be derived from the authors' own experiments. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on their experimental work.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **VCSEL Reliability Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,397 samples from accelerated aging tests on VCSELs, with various operating conditions affecting the degradation. The dataset captures sequences of monitored output power measurements and includes statistical features such as kurtosis and skewness, as well as operating conditions like temperature and laser current.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is derived from the authors' experimental work without a specific external source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the context of the dataset as described in the paper. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
