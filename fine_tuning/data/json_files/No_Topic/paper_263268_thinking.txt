To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IC neuron: An efficient unit to construct neural networks" by Junyi An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will focus on the experiments section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors mention several classification tasks and the datasets used for each task. I will list these datasets as I find them:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: Used for sentiment classification, containing 25,000 movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. The authors mention preprocessing steps, but I need to find the citation.
   
2. **GTZAN Dataset**: Used for music classification, containing 1,000 music clips divided into 10 classes. The dataset is split into 710 clips for training and 290 for testing. I will look for the citation for this dataset as well.

3. **UCI sEMG Dataset**: Used for hand movement recognition, containing 1,800 records divided into six types of hand movements. I will check for the citation.

4. **Google Speech Commands Dataset (V1)**: Used for speech recognition, containing 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words. The authors refer to a specific subset called 20-cmd. I will find the citation for this dataset.

5. **MNIST Dataset**: Used for image classification, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. I will look for the citation.

6. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Also used for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 RGB images in 10 classes. I will find the citation for this dataset.

7. **UCI YEAST Dataset**: Mentioned as a simple dataset with 1,038 training examples. I will check for the citation.

8. **UCI ADULT Dataset**: Contains 32,561 training examples. I will find the citation.

9. **UCI LETTER Dataset**: Contains 16,000 training examples. I will also look for the citation.

Next, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a clear and organized structure for future reference or processing.
