To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effects of Data Imbalance Under a Federated Learning Approach for Credit Risk Forecasting" by Shuyao Zhang, Jordan Tay, and Pedro Baiz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study examines the feasibility of federated learning in credit risk assessment and mentions the use of three datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Corporate Credit Rating Dataset**: This dataset contains 901 companies with 28 financial features from 2014 to 2016. It is used for a multiclass classification task based on the S&P credit rating scale.

2. **Home Credit Default Risk Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset involves over 300,000 samples and 210 features, focusing on binary classification of individual default risk.

3. **Give Me Some Credit Dataset**: Also from Kaggle, this dataset consists of 150,000 samples with 10 features, addressing individual default risk and exhibiting significant class imbalance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Corporate Credit Rating Dataset**:
  > Mingfu Wang and Hyejin Ku. *Utilizing historical data for corporate credit rating assessment*. Expert Systems with Applications, 165:113925, 2021.

- For the **Home Credit Default Risk Dataset**:
  > Anna Montoya, Kirill Odintsov, and Martin Koteck. *Home credit default risk*, 2018.

- For the **Give Me Some Credit Dataset**:
  > Will Cukierski. *Give me some credit*, 2011.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references for any future analysis or reporting.
