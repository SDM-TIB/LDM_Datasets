To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Classifier Learning Based on PEDCC-Loss and Cosine Distance" by Qiuyu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on **EMNIST** and **CIFAR100**, which indicates that these datasets are used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **experiments sections** to gather more context about how these datasets are utilized. The introduction discusses the challenges of incremental learning and mentions the need for datasets that can facilitate this research. The experiments section explicitly states that the authors conducted experiments on **EMNIST** and **CIFAR100**, confirming their use.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed results for both datasets. They mention that EMNIST consists of 40 classes and CIFAR100 consists of 100 classes, which gives me additional context about the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
   > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

2. For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
