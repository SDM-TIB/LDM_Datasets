To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperSIGMA: Hyperspectral Intelligence Comprehension Foundation Model" by Di Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the construction of a large-scale hyperspectral dataset called **HyperGlobal-450K**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly **section 3 (The HyperGlobal-450K Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will find specifics such as the number of images, the types of sensors used, and the geographical coverage of the dataset.

In this section, the authors describe **HyperGlobal-450K** as containing about 450,000 hyperspectral images collected from two sensors: the Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion and Gaofen-5B (GF-5B). They detail the spectral and spatial resolutions of these sensors, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's capabilities.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for validation or comparison. They reference the **Indian Pines** and **Pavia University** datasets for fine-tuning their models, which indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
