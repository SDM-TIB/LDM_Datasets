To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety-Critical Online Control with Adversarial Disturbances" by Bhaskar Ramasubramanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may discuss the context and relevance of the research, potentially mentioning datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention validating their method on a model of the **Tennessee Eastman control challenge**. This indicates that the Tennessee Eastman dataset is likely a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about the Tennessee Eastman dataset, such as its structure, size, and any relevant characteristics. The authors may also reference other datasets or sources in the context of their experiments, so I will keep an eye out for those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the Tennessee Eastman dataset, I will look for the original source or any papers that describe it in detail.

The citation for the Tennessee Eastman dataset is:
> J. J. Downs and E. F. Vogel. *A plant-wide industrial process control problem*. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 17(3), 1993.

If there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will follow the same process to extract their details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
