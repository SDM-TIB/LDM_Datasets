To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ExCode-Mixed: Explainable Approaches towards Sentiment Analysis on Code-Mixed Data using BERT models" by Aman Priyanshu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of sentiment analysis on code-mixed data and mention the SAIL 2017 dataset, which is specifically designed for sentiment classification on Hindi-English code-mixed data. This indicates that a dataset is indeed being utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experimental results sections. The authors explicitly state that the SAIL 2017 dataset has been split into training, validation, and test sets with specific instance counts (10055 for training, 1256 for validation, and 1257 for testing). This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SAIL 2017 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **SAIL 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kamal Sarkar. 2018. Ju ks@sail codemixed-2017: Sentiment analysis for Indian code mixed social media texts.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding the dataset, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
