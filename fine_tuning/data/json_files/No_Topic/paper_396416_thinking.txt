To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FRGNN: Mitigating the Impact of Distribution Shift on Graph Neural Networks via Test-Time Feature Reconstruction" by Rui Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention four datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and ogb-arxiv**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, label rate, and the number of training, validation, and test nodes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

4. **ogb-arxiv Dataset**: 
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. ArXiv:2005.00687.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
