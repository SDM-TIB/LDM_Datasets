To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining Implicit Entity Preference from User-Item Interaction Data for Knowledge Graph Completion via Adversarial Learning" by Gaole He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they adopted the **KB4Rec dataset** to construct evaluation datasets, which contains alignment records between Freebase entities and online items from three domains. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the primary dataset used in their experiments.

The authors specify three user interaction datasets:
1. **MovieLens dataset**: This dataset is used for movie recommendations and contains user-item interactions.
2. **LFM-1b dataset**: This dataset is related to music recommendations and includes user interactions with music items.
3. **Amazon book dataset**: This dataset consists of user interactions with books.

In the paper, the authors provide details about how they processed these datasets, including filtering out unpopular items and inactive users, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets*. TiiS 5, 4 (2016), 1â€“19.

- For the **LFM-1b dataset**, the citation is:
  > Markus Schedl. *The LFM-1b Dataset for Music Retrieval and Recommendation*. In ICMR.

- For the **Amazon book dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian Mcauley. *Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering*. In WWW.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
