To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIASeD: Bringing Irrationality into Automated System Design" by Aditya Gulati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of cognitive biases on AI systems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or case studies. I will focus on any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the use of datasets. Since this paper is theoretical, it may not contain traditional datasets but could reference studies or datasets used in previous research.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited datasets or studies that may have utilized datasets relevant to the paper's claims. This is crucial as it may provide the necessary citations for datasets that the authors refer to indirectly.

After reviewing the paper, I will summarize any identified datasets, including their names, descriptions, and the full citations as follows:

1. **Cognitive Biases Dataset**: If the paper references a dataset that categorizes cognitive biases, I will note its details and citation. For example, if it cites a study that compiled a list of cognitive biases, I will include that.

2. **Human Decision-Making Studies**: If the authors refer to datasets from previous studies on human decision-making that illustrate cognitive biases, I will extract those references and provide full citations.

3. **AI Interaction Studies**: If there are datasets mentioned in the context of AI systems interacting with humans and how biases affect those interactions, I will document those as well.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation in the appropriate format, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

By following this structured approach, I will be able to compile a comprehensive list of datasets referenced in the paper along with their citations, ensuring that I capture all relevant information for future reference or analysis.
