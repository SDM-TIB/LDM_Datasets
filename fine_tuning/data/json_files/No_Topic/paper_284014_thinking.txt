To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Complex-Valued Neural Networks" by Joshua Bassey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the methodology or results sections.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section (Section VI)**, where the authors summarize various applications of complex-valued neural networks. This section often includes references to datasets used in the studies they cite. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to specific studies that utilized datasets.

In the **references section**, I will check for any cited works that may have their own datasets. For example, if the authors mention a specific application of CVNNs in audio processing, I will look for the corresponding citation to see if it includes a dataset.

I will also pay attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or provide additional context about their usage in the experiments discussed in the paper.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset used for audio processing, I will look for the citation in the references that corresponds to that dataset. I will do this for each dataset mentioned throughout the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
