To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating high-dimensional Markov-switching VARs" by Kenwin Maung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical analysis or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author discusses Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications. This section is likely to contain specific datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any named datasets or descriptions of data sources.

In the **conclusion section**, the author may summarize the findings and mention any datasets that were critical to the research. This could provide additional context or references to datasets that were used.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of variables, sample sizes, and the context in which they were used.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Goyal and Welch (2008) predictors," I will look for the full citation in the references to include it in my dataset extraction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, making sure that it is ready for review or further processing.
