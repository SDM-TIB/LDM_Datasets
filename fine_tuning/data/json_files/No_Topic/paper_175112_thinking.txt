To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Feature Nonlinearities with Non-Convex Regularized Binned Regression" by Samet Oymak, Mehrdad Mahdavi, and Jiasi Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.).

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on **synthetic datasets** and **real datasets**. I will note the specific names of these datasets as they are crucial for citation.

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset generated with specific characteristics (e.g., Gaussian data matrix with independent standard normal entries). However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset, so I will refer to it as "Synthetic Dataset" for the purpose of citation.

2. **Human Resources Analytics Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is used to predict employee turnover. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ludovic Benistant. *Human resources analytics*. www.kaggle.com, 2016.

3. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is used to predict income levels based on census data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Barry Becker. *Adult data set*. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1996.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile their details, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I provide full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will include the dataset names, a brief description of each, and their respective citations.
