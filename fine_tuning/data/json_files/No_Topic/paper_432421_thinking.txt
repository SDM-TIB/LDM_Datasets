To extract datasets from the research paper titled "6Img-to-3D: Few-Image Large-Scale Outdoor Driving Scene Reconstruction" by ThÃ©o Gieruc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel method for 3D reconstruction and hints at the use of a dataset produced using the CARLA Simulator. This suggests that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created. Here, they detail that the dataset consists of 2000 single-timestep outdoor driving scenes, each with six outward-facing vehicle images and 100 spherical images for supervision. They also mention the total number of RGB images and the variety of scenes included.

The dataset is produced using the **CARLA Simulator**, which is a crucial detail that I need to note. The authors also state their intention to make the dataset publicly available in the future, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the CARLA Simulator, which is mentioned in the references section of the paper. The relevant citation is:

- **CARLA Simulator**: 
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. arXiv:1711.03938.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: CARLA Dataset for 3D Reconstruction
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 2000 single-timestep complex outdoor driving scenes, each offering six outward-facing vehicle images and 100 spherical images for supervision. The dataset includes a total of 220K individual RGB images, representing various driving scenes, vehicle types, pedestrians, and lighting conditions.
   - **Citation**: Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. arXiv:1711.03938.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations as required.
