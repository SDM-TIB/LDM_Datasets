To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDE Models of Adder Mechanisms in Cellular Proliferation" by Mingtao Xia, Chris D. Greenman, and Tom Chou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors often discuss previous work and may reference datasets used in their research. If they mention any specific datasets or studies, I will note them down.

I will then examine the **methods section** closely, as this section typically details the experimental setup and may include specific datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

Based on the content of the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "E. coli cell size control dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset and provide the citation accordingly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for future reference.
