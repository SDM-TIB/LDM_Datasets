To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Unbiased Label Distribution Learning for Facial Pose Estimation Using Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian" by Zhiwen Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on **AFLW2000** and **BIWI datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **300W-LP**: This is a synthesized dataset containing 122,450 images with a variety of facial poses and identities. It is synthesized from the 300W dataset, which includes around 4,000 images.

2. **AFLW2000**: This dataset consists of the first 2,000 images from the AFLW dataset, which is known for its diverse facial poses in the wild.

3. **BIWI**: This dataset is collected in an indoor environment using an RGB-D camera and provides accurate ground truth labels for facial pose estimation.

The authors also mention that they follow specific experimental scenarios for training and testing, which further emphasizes the importance of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **300W-LP**, the citation is:
  > Sagonas, C., Tzimiropoulos, G., Zafeiriou, S., & Pantic, M. (2013). *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In ICCV Workshops.

- For **AFLW2000**, the citation is:
  > Koestinger, M., Wohlhart, P., Pock, T., & Bischof, H. (2011). *Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild: A Large-scale, Real-world Database for Facial Landmark Localization*. In Proc. First IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking Facial Image Analysis Technologies.

- For **BIWI**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
