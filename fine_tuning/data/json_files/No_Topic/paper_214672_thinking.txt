To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Embeddings for Recommendation" by Stephen Bonner and Flavian Vasile, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Netﬂix** and **MovieLens10M** datasets. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were processed for the experiments.

In the **Experimental Setup** subsection, the authors explain how they preprocess the datasets, including binarizing the ratings and generating a skewed dataset for their experiments. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MovieLens10M dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For the **Netﬂix dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netflix, Inc. *The Netflix Prize*. Available at: https://www.netflixprize.com/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MovieLens10M Dataset**: A dataset containing 10 million ratings from MovieLens, used for evaluating recommendation algorithms. The ratings are binarized for the experiments.

2. **Netﬂix Dataset**: A dataset from the Netflix Prize competition, containing user ratings for movies. The dataset is used to validate the proposed recommendation method.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
