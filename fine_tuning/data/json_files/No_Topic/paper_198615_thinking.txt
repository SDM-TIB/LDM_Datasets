To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Case Based And Rule Based Reasoning: The Possibilistic Connection" by Soumitra Dutta and Piero P. Bonissone, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the research. In this case, I will pay particular attention to sections that discuss experiments or case studies, as these often include datasets. If the paper has a dedicated section for datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection," I will focus on that section for explicit mentions.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described, including their characteristics, size, and purpose. If the authors mention any specific datasets used for experiments or case studies, I will highlight those.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "MARS" in the context of their reasoning system, I will look for the citation that corresponds to this dataset. The citation should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
