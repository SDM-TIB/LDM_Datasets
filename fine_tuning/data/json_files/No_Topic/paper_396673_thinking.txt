To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-range Multimodal Pretraining for Movie Understanding" by Dawit Mureja Argaw et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "publicly available movie dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Long-range Multimodal Pretraining)**, where the authors describe their pretraining dataset. Here, they specifically mention the **Movie Audio Description (MAD) dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the content it includes.

In the **implementation details**, the authors explain how they prepared their training data by extracting video, audio, and language modalities from the MAD dataset. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MAD dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- **Movie Audio Description (MAD) dataset**:
  > Mattia Soldan, Alejandro Pardo, Juan León Alcázar, Fabian Caba, Chen Zhao, Silvio Giancola, and Bernard Ghanem. *MAD: A scalable dataset for language grounding in videos from movie audio descriptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5026–5035, 2022.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In the **Related Works section**, the authors reference the **MovieNet dataset**, which contains 1,100 full movies and 60K trailers with annotations for various tasks. I will also note this dataset and find its citation in the references.

- **MovieNet dataset**:
  > Qingqiu Huang, Yu Xiong, Anyi Rao, Jiaze Wang, and Dahua Lin. *MovieNet: A holistic dataset for movie understanding*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
