To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Sketch Explainability Really Means for Downstream Tasks" by Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on sketch explainability and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several downstream tasks, and I will look for specific references to datasets in the context of these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **TU-Berlin Dataset**: This dataset is used for category-level sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). It contains 250 categories, with 80 free-hand sketches in each category, totaling 204,489 images.

2. **Sketchy Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for fine-grained SBIR and consists of 75,471 sketches across 125 categories, with 100 images in each category.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **TU-Berlin Dataset**:
  > Mathias Eitz, James Hays, and Marc Alexa. *How do humans sketch objects?* ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 31(4):1-10, 2012.

- For the **Sketchy Dataset**:
  > Patsorn Sangkloy, Nathan Burnell, Cusuh Ham, and James Hays. *The Sketchy Database: Learning to Retrieve Badly Drawn Bunnies.* ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(4):1-12, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
