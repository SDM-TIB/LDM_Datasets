To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic detection of cognitive impairment in elderly people using an entertainment chatbot with Natural Language Processing capabilities" by Francisco de Arriba-Pérez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used for evaluation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental design or data collection. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting field tests with a test group of **30 elderly people** under the supervision of gerontologists. However, they do not specify a named dataset in the abstract or introduction. I will continue to search through the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used for analysis or comparison.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **similarity metric** to evaluate user responses, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. They refer to a **sample of 30 patients** from the **Asociación de Familiares de enfermos de Alzheimer y otras demencias de Galicia (afaga)**, which is an organization that collaborates in research on cognitive impairments. This indicates that the data collected during the experiments is likely proprietary or specific to their study.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. However, it appears that the authors primarily reference other studies and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Test Group**: 30 elderly individuals from the **Asociación de Familiares de enfermos de Alzheimer y otras demencias de Galicia (afaga)**.
   - Citation: Not applicable, as this is a specific group rather than a publicly available dataset.

2. **Similarity Metric**: The authors developed a metric based on user responses, but no specific dataset is mentioned for this metric.

In conclusion, while I have identified the test group and the context in which the data was collected, there are no formal datasets with citations provided in the paper. Therefore, I will note that the data is derived from a specific study population rather than a publicly accessible dataset.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
