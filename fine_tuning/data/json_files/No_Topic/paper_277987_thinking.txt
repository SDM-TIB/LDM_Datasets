To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A bounded operator approach to technical indicators without lag" by Frédéric Butin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on technical indicators, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Technical indicators without lag)**, where the author discusses the application of various moving averages and the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). While this section describes methodologies, it does not specify any datasets used for empirical validation.

I will then look into **section 3.4 (Comparison of the three versions of Elder’s impulse system)**, where the author mentions using daily values of the S&P index from the time period of 2017-11-01 to 2018-10-31. This indicates that the S&P index data is a dataset utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the S&P index data. However, since the dataset is based on publicly available financial data, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the data is sourced from the S&P index, which is widely recognized and can be accessed through financial data providers.

The relevant dataset I have identified is:

1. **S&P Index Data**: Daily values of the S&P index from November 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the trading systems discussed in the paper.

Since the S&P index data does not have a specific citation in the references, I will document it as follows:

- For **S&P Index Data**, I will note:
  > S&P 500 Index data, available from financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for any subsequent analysis or review.
