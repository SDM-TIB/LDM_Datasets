To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black-Box Adversarial Attack with Transferable Model-Based Embedding" by Zhichao Huang and Tong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on **MNIST, ImageNet, and Google Cloud Vision API**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.
3. **Google Cloud Vision API**: While not a traditional dataset, it is mentioned as a service that the authors used for testing their method.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

The Google Cloud Vision API does not have a traditional citation as it is a service provided by Google, but I will note its mention in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
