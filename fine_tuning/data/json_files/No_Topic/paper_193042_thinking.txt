To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-set Person Re-identification" by Shengcai Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and mentions a database collected from a video surveillance setting, which is a strong indicator that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the open-set person re-identification problem and mention the database they collected, which consists of 200 persons and 7,413 images. This section confirms the existence of a dataset but does not provide its name yet.

In **section 3 (Database Collection)**, the authors describe the database in detail. They mention that the database is called the **Open-set Person Re-IDentiﬁcation database (OPeRID v1.0)**, which includes images segmented from video footage captured by six cameras. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of persons, images, and the context of collection.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the OPeRID v1.0 database is a new contribution by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the authors and the title of the dataset as it is presented in the paper.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Liao, S., Mo, Z., Zhu, J., Hu, Y., & Li, S. Z. (2023). Open-set Person Re-identification Database (OPeRID v1.0). In Proceedings of the [Conference/Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages]. [Publisher].

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation in the required format. This will allow for clear documentation and future reference for anyone interested in using the dataset for their research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for OPeRID v1.0, ensuring that it is structured correctly and ready for inclusion in any further analysis or processing.
