To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Microsimulation of the Port of Dover" by Chris Roadknight, Uwe Aickelin, and Galina Sherman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes data from the Port of Dover, indicating that there may be relevant datasets.

Next, I will examine **section II (Dover Existing Data)**, where the authors discuss the road haulage vehicle (RHV) traffic data collected over a year. They mention specific statistics, such as the total number of RHVs exiting the UK via the port in 2009, which suggests that this data is part of a dataset.

In this section, the authors also refer to the use of **CCTV camera images** for capturing vehicle arrivals, which indicates another dataset related to vehicle flow at the port. I will note the details of these datasets, including the time frame and the type of data collected.

Moving on to **section V (Validation)**, the authors describe the use of **Bluetooth monitoring** to sample vehicle locations and trip times. This section provides specific details about the sampling locations and the number of vehicles captured, which is crucial for documenting this dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various sources, including studies on traffic simulation and validation methods, which may provide additional context or citations for the datasets used.

The datasets I will extract and document are:

1. **Road Haulage Vehicle (RHV) Traffic Data**: This dataset includes statistics on the number of RHVs using the Port of Dover in 2009, with a total of 1,194,973 RHVs exiting the UK.

2. **CCTV Vehicle Arrival Data**: This dataset is derived from CCTV images capturing vehicle arrivals at the port, providing insights into traffic flow dynamics.

3. **Bluetooth Monitoring Data**: This dataset includes trip times and vehicle counts captured via Bluetooth monitoring at two sampling locations within the port.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references.

- For the **RHV Traffic Data**, the citation is:
  > Roadknight, C., Aickelin, U., & Sherman, G. (2023). *Microsimulation of the Port of Dover*. Intelligent Modelling & Analysis Research Group, School of Computer Science, The University of Nottingham.

- For the **CCTV Vehicle Arrival Data**, the citation is:
  > Roadknight, C., Aickelin, U., & Sherman, G. (2023). *Microsimulation of the Port of Dover*. Intelligent Modelling & Analysis Research Group, School of Computer Science, The University of Nottingham.

- For the **Bluetooth Monitoring Data**, the citation is:
  > Roadknight, C., Aickelin, U., & Sherman, G. (2023). *Microsimulation of the Port of Dover*. Intelligent Modelling & Analysis Research Group, School of Computer Science, The University of Nottingham.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
