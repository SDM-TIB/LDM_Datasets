To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained AutoAugmentation for Multi-Label Classification" by Ya Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Peta Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale pedestrian attributes dataset containing 19,000 images, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. The authors note that they only use 35 attributes for their analysis.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks, containing about 82,000 images for training and additional images for validation and testing. The authors mention that each image has an average of 2.9 labels from a set of 80 object labels.

3. **Charades Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-label video recognition and contains around 9,800 videos of daily indoor activities, with specific splits for training and validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Peta Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yubin Deng, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. *Pedestrian attribute recognition at far distance*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pages 789–792, 2014.

- For the **MS-COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For the **Charades Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A. Sigurdsson, Gül Varol, Xiaolong Wang, Ali Farhadi, Ivan Laptev, and Abhinav Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
