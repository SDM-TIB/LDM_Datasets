To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROBUST ANALYTICS FOR VIDEO-BASED GAIT BIOMETRICS" by Ebenezer Rajiv Hinston Prabhu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the introduction, I will look for any explicit references to datasets or any context that suggests the use of specific datasets for gait analysis.

Next, I will navigate to the **literature survey** and **datasets** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed information about the datasets utilized in the research. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of subjects, types of covariates, and specific conditions under which the data was collected.

In the **experimentation and evaluation** sections, I will look for mentions of datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. This may include specific datasets referenced for performance evaluation, such as the CASIA-B dataset, which is commonly used in gait recognition studies.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset. This includes looking for references in the **references section** of the paper, where the authors typically provide complete citations for the datasets they have used. I will note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its relevance to the research, and that the full citation is accurately recorded.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation process.
