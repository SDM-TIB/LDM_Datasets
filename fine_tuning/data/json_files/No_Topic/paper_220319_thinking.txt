To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantitative Mitigation of Timing Side Channels" by Saeid Tizpaz-Niari, Pavol Černý, and Ashutosh Trivedi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their tool Schmit on **five real-world Java applications**. I will note down the names of these applications as they may serve as datasets for the experiments. The applications mentioned are:

1. **GabFeed**: A chat server application.
2. **Jetty**: A web server application.
3. **Java Verbal Expressions**: A library for constructing regular expressions.
4. **Password Checker**: An application for checking passwords.

I will also look for any additional datasets or benchmarks mentioned in the **results or discussion sections** to ensure I capture all relevant datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or applications mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors reference existing datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to include their full citations. If the applications are publicly available, I will also include links or references to their repositories or documentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
