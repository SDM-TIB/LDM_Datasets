To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More than Just Statistical Recurrence: Human and Machine Unsupervised Learning of Māori Word Segmentation" by Ashvini Varatharaj and Simon Todd, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section** where the authors typically describe the data used for their analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using segmentations from fluent Māori speakers and data collected from non-Māori-speaking New Zealanders (NMS). I will look for specific names of datasets or corpora that were utilized in their experiments.

In the **analysis sections**, particularly in Analysis 1 and Analysis 2, the authors refer to specific groups of words and datasets used for comparison. They mention the use of the **Te Aka dictionary** for training the Morfessor model, which is crucial for understanding the data context.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or corpora mentioned in the paper. For example, the authors refer to the **MAONZE corpus** and the **Māori Broadcast Corpus**, which are important datasets for their analysis.

Here are the datasets I will extract along with their full citations:

1. **Te Aka Dictionary**: 
   > Moorfield, J. C. (2011). *Te Aka: Māori-English, English-Māori Dictionary* (3rd ed.). Pearson, Auckland.

2. **MAONZE Corpus**: 
   > King, J., Maclagan, M., Harlow, R., Keegan, P., & Watson, C. (2011). The MAONZE project: Changing uses of an indigenous language database. *Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory*, 7(1), 37–57.

3. **Māori Broadcast Corpus**: 
   > Boyce, M. T. (2006). A Corpus of Modern Spoken Māori. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Victoria University of Wellington.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
