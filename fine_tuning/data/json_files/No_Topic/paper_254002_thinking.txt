To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Style-based Networks for Motion Synthesis" by Jingwei Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "large-scale skeleton dataset," which indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find the specific name.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CMU Mocap dataset**. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its characteristics and how it was utilized in their experiments.

The authors describe the CMU Mocap dataset as follows: it is a well-known dataset for motion capture that contains various human motion sequences. They mention that they follow the processing procedure of Holden et al. (2016), which is important for understanding how they utilized the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CMU Mocap dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CMU Mocap dataset**, the citation is:
  > CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database. *http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/*.

Since the dataset is widely recognized and does not have a specific paper associated with it, the URL serves as the citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
