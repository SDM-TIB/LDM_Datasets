To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Linking Level Segments" by Colan F. Biemer and Seth Cooper, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses procedural content generation and mentions the use of level segments, which suggests that datasets related to game levels may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. In these sections, the authors describe the games used for testing their linking method: **Mario**, **Kid Icarus**, and **DungeonGrams**. I will look for any specific datasets or sources of data that were used to generate the level segments for these games.

In the **approach section**, the authors mention using training levels from the **VGLC (Video Game Level Corpus)** for Mario and Kid Icarus. This is a key dataset that I need to note down. 

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VGLC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Summerville, A. J., Snodgrass, S., Mateas, M., & Ontanon, S. (2016). The VGLC: The video game level corpus. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.07487*.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to **Gram-Elites**, which is a method for generating level segments, but it does not appear to be a dataset itself. 

I will also note that the authors mention using **44 training levels made for Gram-Elites**, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Since it is part of their methodology, I will include it as a dataset but will note that it lacks a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the datasets I have identified:

1. **Video Game Level Corpus (VGLC)**: This dataset is used for generating levels for Mario and Kid Icarus.
   - Citation: Summerville, A. J., Snodgrass, S., Mateas, M., & Ontanon, S. (2016). The VGLC: The video game level corpus. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.07487*.

2. **Gram-Elites Training Levels**: This dataset consists of 44 training levels used for generating level segments, but no formal citation is provided.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for clarity and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
