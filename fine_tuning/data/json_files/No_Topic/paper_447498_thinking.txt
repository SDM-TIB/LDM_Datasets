To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Adversarially Robust Vision-Language Models" by Rishika Bhagwatkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors outline the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using the **COCO** and **Flickr30k** datasets for image captioning, and several datasets for Visual Question Answering (VQA), including **VQAv2**, **TextVQA**, **OK-VQA**, and **VizWiz**.

In **section 3.2 (Tasks)**, the authors explicitly state the datasets used for each task:
- For image captioning, they use:
  - **COCO** (Lin et al., 2014)
  - **Flickr30k** (Plummer et al., 2015)
  
- For VQA, they use:
  - **VQAv2** (Antol et al., 2015)
  - **TextVQA** (Singh et al., 2019)
  - **OK-VQA** (Marino et al., 2019)
  - **VizWiz** (Gurari et al., 2018)

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
