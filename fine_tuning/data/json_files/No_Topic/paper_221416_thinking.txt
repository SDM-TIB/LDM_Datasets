To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) – A Rapid Method for the Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations" by Vikas Dwivedi and Balaji Srinivasan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of PIELM and its application to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction mentions the limitations of traditional numerical methods and the advantages of using neural networks, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Performance evaluation of PIELM)**, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list datasets used for testing the PIELM method. In this section, the authors present various test cases (TC-1 to TC-10) that evaluate the performance of PIELM on different PDEs. 

I will note that **Table 1** lists the test cases, including descriptions of each case, but it does not provide explicit dataset names. However, the authors mention that some test cases are taken from existing literature, which may imply the use of datasets from those sources.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for any citations that correspond to the test cases mentioned in the experiments. For example, TC-1, TC-2, TC-4, TC-5, and TC-6 are taken from Berg et al. [3], and TC-8 is taken from Kopriva et al. [22]. I will extract the full citations for these references.

The full citations for the datasets used in the experiments are as follows:

1. For TC-1, TC-2, TC-4, TC-5:
   > Berg, Jens, and Kaj Nyström. "A unified deep artificial neural network approach to partial differential equations in complex geometries." *Neurocomputing* 317 (2018): 28-41.

2. For TC-8:
   > Kopriva, David A., and Gregor J. Gassner. "An energy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element discretization for variable coefficient advection problems." *SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing* 36.4 (2014): A2076-A2099.

3. For TC-9 and TC-10:
   > Borker, Raunak, Charbel Farhat, and Radek Tezaur. "A high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for unsteady advection–diffusion problems." *Journal of Computational Physics* 332 (2017): 520-537.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.
