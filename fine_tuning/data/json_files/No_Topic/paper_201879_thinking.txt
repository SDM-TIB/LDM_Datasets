To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing CNN and LSTM character-level embeddings in BiLSTM-CRF models for chemical and disease named entity recognition" by Zenan Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **BioCreative V CDR corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental methodology section** (specifically section 2) where the authors describe their dataset usage. In **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, they provide detailed information about the **BioCreative V CDR corpus**. The authors mention that this corpus consists of 1000 manually-annotated abstracts for training and development, and another set of 500 manually-annotated abstracts for testing. This section confirms that the BioCreative V CDR corpus is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the BioCreative V CDR corpus is:

> Jiao Li, Yueping Sun, Robin J. Johnson, Daniela Sciaky, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Robert Leaman, Allan Peter Davis, Carolyn J. Mattingly, Thomas C. Wiegers, and Zhiyong Lu. *BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction*. Database, 2016:baw068.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the BioCreative V CDR corpus, ready for further processing or review.
