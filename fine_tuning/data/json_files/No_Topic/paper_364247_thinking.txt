To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gumbel-Softmax Selective Networks" by Mahmoud Salem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **public datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention four public datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the supplementary material, I find detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Concrete Compressive Strength**: This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 1,030 instances used for predicting compressive strength based on eight numerical input variables. The citation for this dataset is:
   > I-Cheng Yeh. *Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using artificial neural networks*. Cement and Concrete Research, 28(12):1797–1808, 1998.

2. **California Housing**: This dataset contains 20,640 instances for predicting median housing values in California districts based on eight input features. The citation for this dataset is:
   > R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry. *Sparse spatial autoregressions*. Statistics and Probability Letters, 33(3):291–297, 1997.

3. **Ames Housing**: This dataset features 1,460 instances of houses sold in Ames, Iowa, and is used to predict house sale prices. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dean De Cock. *Ames housing dataset*, 2011. URL https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression.

4. **ImageNet-100**: This is a 100-class subset of the ImageNet dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yonglong Tian, Dilip Krishnan, and Phillip Isola. *Contrastive multiview coding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05849, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly described, and the full citation will be included to ensure proper attribution.
