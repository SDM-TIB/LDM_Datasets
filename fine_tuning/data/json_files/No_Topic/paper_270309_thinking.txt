To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impulsive Noise Immunity of Multidimensional Pulse Position Modulation" by Michael D. Collins and William B. Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets or experimental data. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and the challenges posed by impulsive noise. They mention testing their modulation method but do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where they describe their testing procedures and circuit implementations. Here, they detail the experimental setup and the types of noise encountered, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions of data collected during the experiments. The authors present results related to packet error rates and signal-to-noise ratios, but again, they do not refer to specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided or referenced in the text. The authors focus on experimental results derived from their own testing rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets.

Since I did not find any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets. However, I will note that the authors reference several works in their discussion of noise models and comparisons with other modulation techniques, which could be useful for further research.

In conclusion, while I have carefully searched the paper for datasets, it seems that the authors did not include any formal datasets or references to external datasets in their study. Therefore, I will summarize my findings without any dataset citations.
