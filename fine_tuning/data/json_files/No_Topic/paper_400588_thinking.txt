To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TCOVIS: Temporally Consistent Online Video Instance Segmentation" by Junlong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on four widely adopted video instance segmentation benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note the names of these datasets as they are mentioned.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. This section is likely to contain the specific names and characteristics of the datasets, which I need to extract.

In section 4.1, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **YouTube-VIS 2019**: This dataset includes 4,883 unique video instances with 131,000 high-quality manual annotations, categorized into 40 predefined categories. The training/test split consists of 2,238 videos for training, 302 for validation, and 343 for testing.

2. **YouTube-VIS 2021**: An improved version of the 2019 dataset, it adds 4,883 more unique video instances while maintaining the 40-category label set.

3. **YouTube-VIS 2022**: This dataset builds upon the 2021 version by including 71 additional long evaluation videos.

4. **OVIS (Occluded Video Instance Segmentation)**: This dataset contains 901 videos across 25 semantic categories, with a total of 5,223 unique video instances. The training/test split includes 607 videos for training, 607 for validation, and 154 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **YouTube-VIS 2019**, the citation is:
  > Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, and Ning Xu. *Video instance segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5188–5197, 2019.

- For **YouTube-VIS 2021**, the citation is:
  > Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, and Ning Xu. *Video instance segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5188–5197, 2019. (Note: The same citation is used as it is an extension of the original dataset.)

- For **YouTube-VIS 2022**, the citation is:
  > Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, and Ning Xu. *Video instance segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5188–5197, 2019. (Again, the same citation applies.)

- For **OVIS**, the citation is:
  > Jiyang Qi, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Xinggang Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Xiang Bai, Serge Belongie, Alan Yuille, Philip HS Torr, and Song Bai. *Occluded video instance segmentation: A benchmark*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 130(8):2022–2039, 2022.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
