To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Unified Representations for Multi-Resolution Face Recognition" by Hulingxiao He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate strong performance on face recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **MS1Mv3 dataset** for training face embedding models, which contains 5,179,510 images of 93,431 celebrities. This is a significant dataset for face recognition tasks.

Additionally, the authors reference several face verification benchmarks, including:

1. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: A well-known dataset for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments.
2. **CFP-FF (Celebrities in Frontal Profile)**: Another dataset used for face verification tasks.
3. **CFP-FP**: A variant of the CFP dataset.
4. **AgeDB-30**: A dataset that includes age variations for face recognition.
5. **CALFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: A dataset designed to study cross-age face recognition.
6. **CPLFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: A dataset for studying cross-pose face recognition.
7. **QMUL-SurvFace**: A large-scale surveillance face dataset used for 1:N face identification, which contains native low-resolution surveillance faces.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
