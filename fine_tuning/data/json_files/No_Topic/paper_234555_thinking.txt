To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-Decoder Augmented Network for Neural Machine Translation" by Boyuan Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several NMT benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors mention using three pairs of languages for their experiments: English-to-German (En→De), English-to-French (En→Fr), and English-to-Vietnamese (En→Vi). They specifically refer to the datasets used for these language pairs.

1. **WMT 14 Dataset**: For the English-to-German and English-to-French translations, the authors utilize the standard filtered WMT 14 dataset, which contains 1.9 million training sentence pairs for En→De and 2.0 million for En→Fr.

2. **IWSLT 2015 Dataset**: For the English-to-Vietnamese translation, the authors use the IWSLT 2015 dataset, which consists of 133,000 training sentences and 1,200 testing sentences.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WMT 14 dataset**, the citation is:
  > "WMT 14: The 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation." In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2014. Available at: http://statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.

- For the **IWSLT 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > "IWSLT 2015 Evaluation Campaign." In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2015. Available at: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/data/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
