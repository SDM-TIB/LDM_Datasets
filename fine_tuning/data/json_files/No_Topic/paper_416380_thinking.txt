To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Creating Personalized Synthetic Voices from Articulation Impaired Speech Using Augmented Reconstruction Loss" by Yusheng Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on creating synthetic voices for tongue cancer survivors, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to speech recordings.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of creating personalized text-to-speech (TTS) models from articulation-impaired speech. They mention the use of recordings from a specific patient, which indicates that there may be a dataset derived from these recordings.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Systems, speech corpora and training details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Recording T**: This dataset consists of 377 recordings from a female Cantonese speaker who has undergone partial-glossectomy. It contains approximately 24 minutes of speech data recorded in a quiet environment.

2. **Recording S**: This dataset includes 377 recordings of unimpaired speech from another female Cantonese speaker, containing the same content as Recording T. This dataset serves as the source for voice conversion.

Additionally, the authors refer to a third dataset:

3. **CUSENT**: A multi-speaker Cantonese speech corpus that consists of around 20 hours of read speech from 80 speakers, which is used for TTS pre-training.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since Recording T and Recording S are specific to this study and do not have external citations, I will note them as internal datasets. For CUSENT, I will find its citation:

- For **CUSENT**, the citation is:
  > T. Lee, W. K. Lo, P.-C. Ching, and H. Meng. "Spoken language resources for Cantonese speech processing." *Speech Communication*, vol. 36, no. 3-4, pp. 327â€“342, 2002.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Recording T**: 377 recordings from a female Cantonese speaker with articulation impairment.
2. **Recording S**: 377 recordings of unimpaired speech from another female Cantonese speaker.
3. **CUSENT**: A multi-speaker Cantonese speech corpus used for TTS pre-training.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable, and prepare them for structured output.
