To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Online Regrets: From Deleted Posts to Risk Awareness in Social Network Sites" by Nicolás Emilio Díaz Ferreyra, Rene Meis, and Maritta Heisel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of deleted posts as risk information vehicles, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to user-generated content on social network sites (SNSs).

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** in detail, particularly the part where the authors describe their method for collecting evidence of unwanted incidents using deleted posts. This section may contain specific references to datasets or data collection methods that could be relevant.

In the **related work section**, I will look for any citations or references to existing datasets that the authors may have used or built upon. This could provide additional context or specific datasets that are relevant to their research.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets that were analyzed or created as part of their study. They may provide insights into the size, scope, or characteristics of the datasets they worked with.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others interested in this research.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that were highlighted in the paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively, ensuring that all necessary citations are included for future reference.
