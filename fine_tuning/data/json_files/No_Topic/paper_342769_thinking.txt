To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Mesh Attention Networks" by Sourya Basu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **FAUST** and **TOSCA** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they perform experiments on the **FAUST** dataset for segmentation tasks and the **TOSCA** dataset for classification tasks. This confirms that both datasets are used in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide some details about the **FAUST dataset**, describing it as consisting of 100 3D human meshes with 6890 vertices each, split into training and test sets. They also mention the **TOSCA dataset**, which consists of 80 meshes belonging to nine different classes.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **FAUST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Matthew Loper, and Michael J. Black. *FAUST: Dataset and Evaluation for 3D Mesh Registration*. In CVPR, 2014.

2. For the **TOSCA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alexander M. Bronstein, Michael M. Bronstein, and Ron Kimmel. *Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes*. Springer Science & Business Media, 2008.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **FAUST Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 100 3D human meshes with 6890 vertices each, used for segmentation tasks.
- **TOSCA Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 80 meshes belonging to nine different classes, used for classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
