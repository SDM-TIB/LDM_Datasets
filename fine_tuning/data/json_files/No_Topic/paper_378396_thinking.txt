To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel-interpolation-based spatial active noise control with exterior radiation suppression" by Kazuyuki Arikawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will carefully examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to look for any specific datasets that were utilized in the numerical experiments. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for evaluation. I will pay particular attention to the **4.1 Settings** subsection, as it often outlines the parameters and datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for mentions of datasets, such as specific datasets used for noise control or sound field analysis. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will consider whether the authors refer to any established datasets in the field of active noise control or sound field analysis. In such cases, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments section, particularly the settings subsection, for specific datasets used.
3. Note any dataset names and descriptions provided in the paper.
4. Check the references for full citations of the datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
