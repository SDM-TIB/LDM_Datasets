To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Synthesis of Safety Certificates and Safe Control Policy using Constrained Reinforcement Learning" by Haitong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on..." or "the following datasets were used...". This will help me pinpoint the datasets that are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, as well as any references to prior works that may provide additional context or citation information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

For example, if the paper mentions using the "Safety Gym" environment, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will search for the original paper that introduced the Safety Gym environment to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. Each dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy throughout the extraction process.
