To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-Party Dialogue Resource in French" by Maria Boritchev and Maxime Amblard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Dialogues in Games (DinG)** corpus, which is a key dataset for this research. The introduction further elaborates on the purpose and characteristics of DinG, indicating that it is a corpus of spontaneous dialogues from players of the board game Catan.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the DinG corpus in detail, including its structure, the number of recordings, and the nature of the dialogues. I will note the specifics about the corpus, such as the number of recordings (10), the average length of recordings, and the types of annotations performed.

I will also check the **tables** presented in the paper, particularly Table 1, which summarizes the data collected from the DinG corpus, including metrics like the number of turns, questions, and speech duration. This table provides quantitative insights into the dataset.

After gathering the necessary information about the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the DinG corpus. The paper does not provide a separate citation for DinG, but it is essential to reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Boritchev, M., & Amblard, M. (2023). A Multi-Party Dialogue Resource in French. *Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, LORIA, UMR 7503, Universit√© de Lorraine, CNRS, Inria*.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset, its characteristics, and the citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
