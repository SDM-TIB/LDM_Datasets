To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stereotyping and Bias in the Flickr30K Dataset" by Emiel van Miltenburg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the Flickr30K dataset, which is a collection of over 30,000 images with crowdsourced descriptions. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's discussion on biases in image annotations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the dataset in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss the methodology or analysis. In the introduction, the author references the Flickr30K dataset and its use in training and evaluating neural network models for image descriptions. This confirms that the dataset is indeed a focal point of the research.

I will then check for any detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **methodology or results sections**. The paper discusses the biases present in the descriptions associated with the Flickr30K dataset, but it does not introduce any new datasets or variations. The focus remains on analyzing the existing dataset.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Flickr30K dataset, I will ensure to find the full citation for it in the **references section**. The citation for the Flickr30K dataset is as follows:

- For the **Flickr30K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2, 67-78.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Flickr30K dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and formatted according to the specified requirements.
