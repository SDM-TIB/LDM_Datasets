To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Private, fair and accurate: Training large-scale, privacy-preserving AI models in medical imaging" by Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions two datasets: a large dataset of clinical chest radiographs and a dataset of 3D abdominal CT images. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for in detail.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly subsection 2.1 titled **Patient Cohorts**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **UKA-CXR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 193,311 frontal chest X-ray images from 54,176 patients, all manually labeled by radiologists. The labels include various conditions such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. The dataset is split into training and test sets.

2. **PDAC Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,625 abdominal CT scans from unique patients, with a focus on classifying the presence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The dataset is also split into training and validation/test subsets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For the **UKA-CXR Dataset**, the citation is:
> Firas Khader, Tianyu Han, Gustav MÃ¼ller-Franzes, Luisa Huck, Philipp Schad, Sebastian Keil, Emona Barzakova, Maximilian Schulze-Hagen, Federico Pedersoli, Volkmar Schulz, et al. *Artificial intelligence for clinical interpretation of bedside chest radiographs*. Radiology, page 220510, 2022.

For the **PDAC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Alexander Ziller, Christiane Kuhl, Marcus Makowski, Sven Nebelung, Rickmer Braren, Daniel Rueckert, Daniel Truhn, and Georgios Kaissis. *Training large-scale, privacy-preserving AI models in medical imaging*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL), 2024.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.
