To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Text Representations: A Theory-Driven Approach" by Gregory Yauney and David Mimno, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets related to natural language inference (NLI) tasks, specifically:

1. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating NLI models.
2. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: Another dataset used for NLI tasks, derived from the SQuAD dataset.
3. **WNLI (Winograd Natural Language Inference)**: A smaller dataset designed to test NLI models on specific linguistic challenges.
4. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A widely used dataset for training and evaluating NLI models.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as preprocessing steps or specific statistics that may be relevant for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **MNLI**:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In NAACL.

- For **QNLI**:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In EMNLP.

- For **WNLI**:
  > Levesque, H. J., Davis, E., & Morgenstern, J. (2011). The Winograd Schema Challenge. In AAAI Spring Symposium: Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning.

- For **SNLI**:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, S., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In EMNLP.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent analysis or application.
