To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retinal Image Segmentation with Small Datasets" by Nchongmaje Ndipenoch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model was evaluated on the **Duke DME dataset**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they describe the **Duke DME dataset** as consisting of 110 B-scans from 10 patients suffering from diabetic macular edema (DME). They also provide specifics about the data collection and annotation process, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Duke DME dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Duke DME Dataset**: 
  > Chiu, S., Allingham, M., Mettu, P., Cousins, S., Izatt, J., and Farsiu, S. (2015). Kernel regression based segmentation of optical coherence tomography images with diabetic macular edema. *Biomedical Optics Express*, 6.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Duke DME dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
