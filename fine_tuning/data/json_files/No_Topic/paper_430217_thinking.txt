To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedSelect: Personalized Federated Learning with Customized Selection of Parameters for Fine-Tuning" by Rishub Tamirisa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning and mention that they evaluate their method across a range of benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention four benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, Mini-ImageNet, and OfficeHome**. Each dataset is used to demonstrate the performance of their proposed method, FedSelect.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-10-C**: The citation is:
   > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

3. **Mini-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017.

4. **OfficeHome**: The citation is:
   > Hemanth Venkateswara, José Eusébio, Shayok Chakraborty, and Sethuraman Panchanathan. *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
