To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Sentiment Embeddings: Joint Projection of Sentiment Across Languages" by Jeremy Barnes, Roman Klinger, and Sabine Schulte im Walde, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Resources)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two main datasets:

1. **OpeNER English and Spanish Datasets**: These datasets are used for aspect-level sentiment analysis and contain hotel reviews annotated with sentiment labels. The authors reference the work of Agerri et al. (2013) for these datasets.

2. **MultiBooked Catalan and Basque Datasets**: Similar to the OpeNER datasets, these datasets also consist of hotel reviews annotated for sentiment analysis. The authors cite their own work (Barnes et al., 2018) for this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **OpeNER Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Rodrigo Agerri, Josu Bermudez, and German Rigau. *OpeNER: Open polarity enhanced named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3823–3828, 2014.

- For the **MultiBooked Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Barnes, Patrik Lambert, and Toni Badia. *Multibooked: A corpus of Basque and Catalan hotel reviews annotated for aspect-level sentiment classification*. In Proceedings of 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC’18).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
