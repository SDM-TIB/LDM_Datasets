To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-based Quantization for Neural Networks" by Wenhao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of applying deep neural networks on resource-constrained platforms and mentions experimental results, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

Upon reviewing Section IV, I find that the authors mention using two datasets for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset is widely known in the machine learning community and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The CIFAR datasets are commonly cited, and I can find their authoritative citations there.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
