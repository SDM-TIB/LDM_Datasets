To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crafting Large Language Models for Enhanced Interpretability" by Chung-En Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new model (CB-LLM) and its performance on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several standard text classification benchmarks:

1. **SST2**: This dataset consists of 6,920 training samples, 872 validation samples, and 1,821 test samples of movie reviews categorized into positive and negative classes.

2. **Yelp Polarity (YelpP)**: This dataset contains 560,000 training samples and 38,000 test samples of Yelp reviews, also categorized into positive and negative classes.

3. **AGnews**: This dataset includes 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples of news articles across four classes.

4. **DBpedia**: This dataset comprises 560,000 training samples and 70,000 test samples from DBpedia 2014, categorized into 14 classes.

I will confirm these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **results section** where the authors discuss the performance of their model on these datasets, ensuring that they are indeed the ones used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **SST2**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In EMNLP.

- For **Yelp Polarity**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J. J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In NeurIPS.

- For **AGnews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J. J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In NeurIPS.

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:
  > Lehmann, J., Isele, R., Jakob, M., Jentzsch, A., Kontokostas, D., Mendes, P. N., Hellmann, S., Morsey, M., van Kleef, P., Auer, S., & Bizer, C. (2015). DBpedia - a large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. Semantic Web.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
