To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding the Horizon: Enabling Hybrid Quantum Transfer Learning for Long-Tailed Chest X-Ray Classification" by Skylar Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of a Jax-based framework on large-scale chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of multi-label classification in medical imaging, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods** and **experiments** sections, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their study:

1. **NIH-CXR-LT**: This dataset consists of 112,120 frontal CXRs from 30,805 patients, with 19 disease labels. The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits used for their experiments.

2. **MIMIC-CXR-LT**: This dataset contains 377,110 CXRs from 65,379 patients, also with the same 19 disease labels. The authors mention using a specific testing split for evaluating model generalizability.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NIH-CXR-LT**, the citation is:
  > G. Holste, S. Wang, Z. Jiang, T. C. Shen, G. Shih, R. M. Summers, Y. Peng, and Z. Wang. "Long-tailed classification of thorax diseases on chest x-ray: A new benchmark study." In MICCAI Workshop on Data Augmentation, Labelling, and Imperfections, Springer, 2022, pp. 22â€“32.

- For **MIMIC-CXR-LT**, the citation is:
  > A. E. Johnson, T. J. Pollard, N. R. Greenbaum, M. P. Lungren, C.-y. Deng, Y. Peng, Z. Lu, R. G. Mark, S. J. Berkowitz, and S. Horng. "MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs." arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference. This will facilitate easy access to the datasets for anyone interested in replicating or building upon the research.
