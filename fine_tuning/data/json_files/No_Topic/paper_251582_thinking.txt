To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CD-split and HPD-split: efficient conformal regions in high dimensions" by Rafael Izbicki, Gilson Shimizu, and Rafael B. Stern, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets used for simulations or real-world applications, I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Happy A dataset** for photometric redshift prediction. I will gather details about this dataset, including its size and the context in which it is used.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. For the Happy A dataset, I will look for the original source or publication that describes it in detail.

The citation for the Happy A dataset is:
> Beck, R., Lin, C.-A., Ishida, E., Gieseke, F., de Souza, R., Costa-Duarte, M., Hattab, M., Krone-Martins, A., and Collaboration, C. (2017). On the realistic validation of photometric redshifts. *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, 468(4):4323â€“4339.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
