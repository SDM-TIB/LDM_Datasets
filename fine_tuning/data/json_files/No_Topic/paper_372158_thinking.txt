To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Approach to Modeling the Value of Statistical Life Using Average Per Capita Income" by Stanislav Levytskyi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusions** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the value of statistical life in Ukraine, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to demographic indicators and economic evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach to modeling. They mention using statistical data from **Zaporozhye Oblast statistics for 2018-2019**, which indicates that there are datasets related to demographic indicators and average per capita income.

In the **results** section, the authors present various tables that include economic evaluations and demographic statistics. For example, they provide tables with the **economic equivalent of the cost of living** and **average expected life duration** for different age groups in Zaporozhye Oblast. These tables are crucial as they contain numerical data that can be classified as datasets.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets that may not have been included in the main text. The paper includes several tables with detailed demographic statistics, such as the **number of individuals surviving to certain ages** and **probabilities of dying at different ages**, which are essential for understanding the modeling of statistical life value.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations will be derived from the references section, ensuring that I accurately attribute the sources of the datasets used in the analysis.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.
