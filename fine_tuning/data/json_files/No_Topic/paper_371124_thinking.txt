To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Precoding via Characteristic Functions for VSAT to Multi-Satellite Uplink Transmission" by Maik RÃ¶per et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical evaluations section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional information regarding datasets, especially if the authors provide details about the data distributions or characteristics used in their simulations.

Once I identify any datasets, I will then look at the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like "LEO satellite swarm data" or "Gaussian distributed position uncertainty data," I will need to find the original source or paper that describes this dataset and provide the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
