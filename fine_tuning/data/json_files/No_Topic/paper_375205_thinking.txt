To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Label Encodings for Deep Regression" by Deval Shah and Tor M. Aamodt, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including the names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for evaluation, including:

1. **300LP Dataset**: This dataset is used for facial landmark detection and contains images with annotated landmarks. The authors specify that it includes 300 images with various poses and expressions.

2. **BIWI Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for head pose estimation and consists of video sequences of subjects with annotated head poses.

3. **COFW Dataset**: This dataset is another facial landmark detection dataset that includes images with occlusions and various facial expressions.

4. **300W Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for facial landmark detection and includes images with a variety of poses and expressions.

5. **WFLW Dataset**: This dataset is also for facial landmark detection and contains images with challenging conditions such as occlusions and variations in lighting.

6. **MORPH-II Dataset**: This dataset is used for age estimation and contains images of individuals with age annotations.

7. **AFAD Dataset**: This dataset is also used for age estimation and includes a large number of images with age labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
