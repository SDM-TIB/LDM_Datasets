To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Super-Resolution as Text-Guided Details Generation" by Chenxi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of several datasets for training and testing their models. This indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Protocols)**, where the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used in their experiments. The table lists the following datasets:

1. **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB)**: This dataset contains 8,855 images with 10 text descriptions per image.
2. **Oxford-102 Flower Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,155 images with 10 text descriptions per image.
3. **CelebA**: This dataset has 39,829 images with 10 text descriptions per image.
4. **Microsoft COCO**: This dataset consists of 80,000 training images and 40,000 test images, with 5 text descriptions per image.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001. California Institute of Technology.

- For **Oxford-102**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 3730â€“3738.

- For **Microsoft COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study.
