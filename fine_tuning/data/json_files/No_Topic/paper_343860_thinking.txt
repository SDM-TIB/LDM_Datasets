To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Most Equitable Voting Rules" by Lirong Xia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data," or "Experiments." This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the analysis or results. Authors often discuss the implications of their findings in relation to the datasets, which can provide additional context.

Once I identify the datasets, I will compile the necessary details for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key features.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

I will also consult the **References section** of the paper to ensure that I have the correct citations for the datasets. This is crucial, as the authors may have cited the original sources of the datasets, which I need to include in my documentation.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
