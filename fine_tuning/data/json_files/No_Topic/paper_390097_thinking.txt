To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error correcting 2D-3D cascaded network for myocardial infarct scar segmentation on late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance images" by Matthias Schwab et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset from the EMIDEC challenge, which is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **LGE CMR database from the EMIDEC challenge**. The description includes the number of clinical exams, the distribution of healthy patients versus those with myocardial infarction, and the imaging protocols used.

The authors specify that the dataset consists of **150 clinical exams**, with **100 for training** and **50 for testing**. They also describe the imaging characteristics, such as the use of 1.5T and 3T Siemens MRI scanners and the specific imaging sequence used.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the EMIDEC dataset is:

- For the **EMIDEC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lalande, A., Chen, Z., Decourselle, T., Qayyum, A., Pommier, T., Lorgis, L., de la Rosa, E., Cochet, A., Cottin, Y., Ginhac, D., Salomon, M., Couturier, R., Meriaudeau, F. (2022). Deep learning methods for automatic evaluation of delayed enhancement-MRI: the results of the EMIDEC challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 79, 102428. doi:10.1016/j.media.2022.102428.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **LGE CMR Database from the EMIDEC Challenge**: This dataset includes 150 clinical exams, with a mix of healthy patients and patients with myocardial infarction. It contains LGE CMR images in short axis orientation covering the left ventricle.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and its citation into a structured format for further use or processing.
