To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning of Artist Group Factors to Musical Genre Classification" by Jaehun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **FMA dataset** for training, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the challenge of predicting musical genres using the FMA dataset. This reinforces the importance of the FMA dataset in their experiments.

I will then proceed to **section 2 (Initial Data Exploration)**, where the authors describe their exploration of the training data. They mention that the dataset includes **25,000 tracks from 5,152 unique albums**, which provides additional context about the dataset's scale and structure.

In **section 3 (Methodology)**, the authors detail their approach to extracting artist group factors and mention the use of various feature sets, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they focus on the processing of the FMA dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FMA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **FMA dataset**, the citation is:
  > MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Kirell Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst, and Xavier Bresson. *FMA: A Dataset for Music Analysis*. In 18th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the FMA dataset and does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the FMA dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry for this paper.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for further processing or review.
