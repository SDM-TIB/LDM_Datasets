To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event Coreference Resolution via a Multi-loss Neural Network without Using Argument Information" by Xinyu Zuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the main body of the text.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of event coreference resolution and mention the use of the **ECB+ corpus** for evaluation. This indicates that a dataset is involved, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will check the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 5 (Evaluation)**, they explicitly state that they perform experiments on the **ECB+ corpus** and provide details about how they split the dataset into training, development, and test sets. This section confirms the use of the ECB+ corpus as the primary dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **ECB+ corpus** in the **References section**. The authors reference the ECB+ corpus as follows:

- For **ECB+ corpus**, the citation is:
  > Cybulska, A., & Vossen, P. (2014). Guidelines for ecb+ annotation of events and their coreference. Technical Report NWR-2014-1, VU University Amsterdam.

Since the ECB+ corpus is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
