To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Reinforcement Learning based Logic Synthesis" by Chao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the algorithm is verified on the **EPFL benchmark**, a private dataset, and a circuit at industrial scale. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Revisiting RL-based Logic Synthesis)**, where the authors discuss their experiments. They mention using **four circuits from the EPFL benchmark** and **four from other sources** as a circuit dataset, referred to as **EPFL-Test**. This section will likely provide more details about the datasets used.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their evaluation on the **INDU dataset**, which consists of 40 circuits, of which 10 were used for training and the rest for evaluation. This section will confirm the datasets used for their experiments and provide context for their application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **EPFL benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Luca Amarú, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, and Giovanni De Micheli. *The EPFL combinational benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Workshop on Logic & Synthesis (IWLS), 2015.

2. **INDU dataset**: Since this dataset is described as a private dataset for industrial use, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that it consists of 40 circuits, and I will mention it as a private dataset without a formal citation.

3. **Additional circuits**: The paper also references circuits from other sources, such as:
   > Richard Brglez, David Bryan, and Krzysztof Kozminski. *Combinational profiles of sequential benchmark circuits*. In IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, pages 1929–1934, 1989.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
