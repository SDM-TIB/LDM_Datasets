To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Primary Frequency Control: A Lyapunov Approach" by Wenqi Cui, Yan Jiang, and Baosen Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and results, which may include references to specific datasets used for training or testing their models.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name in the abstract or introduction. However, they refer to simulation studies conducted on the **IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus (NE39) power networks**. This indicates that the NE39 power network model is a key dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system:

- For the **IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system**, the citation is:
  > "IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2011.

Since this is the only dataset referenced in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system**: A widely used benchmark for power system stability analysis and control, utilized in the simulations of the proposed reinforcement learning approach.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation for future reference or downstream processing.
