To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Hop Table Retrieval for Open-Domain Text-to-SQL" by Xuanliang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **SpiderUnion** and **BirdUnion+**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their research. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They explicitly state that they validate their method on **SpiderUnion** and **BirdUnion+**. I will note down the key characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

1. **SpiderUnion**: This dataset is sourced from the Spider dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for text-to-SQL tasks. The authors mention that SpiderUnion contains 658 questions with an average of 1.48 tables per question.

2. **BirdUnion+**: This dataset is created by combining tables from the Bird dataset, which is designed to be closer to real-world scenarios. BirdUnion+ consists of 1534 questions with an average of 1.92 tables per question.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **Spider**, the citation is:
  > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Kai Yang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Dongxu Wang, Zifan Li, James Ma, Irene Li, Qingning Yao, Shanelle Roman, Zilin Zhang, and Dragomir Radev. *Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Bird**, the citation is:
  > Haoyang Li, Jing Zhang, Cuiping Li, and Hong Chen. *Can LLM already serve as a database interface? A BIg bench for large-scale database grounded text-to-SQLs*. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
