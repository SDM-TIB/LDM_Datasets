To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fidelity of Interpretability Methods and Perturbation Artifacts in Neural Networks" by Lennart Brocki and Neo Christopher Chung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of interpretability methods using a model trained on ImageNet, which suggests that the ImageNet dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **methods section** for any specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention using the **ResNet-50 model trained on the ImageNet dataset**. This indicates that ImageNet is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the accuracy of the model using different importance estimators, but they do not introduce any new datasets. The focus remains on the evaluation of methods rather than on additional datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the ImageNet dataset for evaluating interpretability methods, I will compile this information into a structured format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: Used for training the ResNet-50 model and evaluating interpretability methods.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for the ImageNet dataset, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
