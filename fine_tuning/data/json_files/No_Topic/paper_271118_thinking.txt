To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making a Dynamic Interaction Between Two Power System Analysis Software" by Amirreza Sahami and Shahram Montaser Kouhsari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections, as they often contain references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for dynamic interaction between software packages and mention the use of PASHA and MATLAB. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe the process of linking the two software packages. Here, they mention the use of **User Defined Equipment Modeling (UDEM)**, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **results** section, where the authors present various figures and tables. In **Table I**, they provide generator data, which includes parameters such as voltage, resistance, reactance, and inertia constant. This data is crucial for understanding the simulations conducted but does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense, as it is not a collection of observations or instances.

I will also check the **conclusion** section to see if the authors summarize any datasets used in their research. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the methodology and results of the software interaction rather than on specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. The data presented in the tables is specific to the experiments conducted by the authors and does not reference external datasets.

In summary, I will document the generator data from **Table I** as it is the only structured data presented in the paper, but I will note that it is not a dataset in the conventional sense. I will also ensure to provide the full citation for the paper itself, as it is important for referencing the source of the data.

The citation for the paper is:

Since there are no external datasets mentioned, I will not create any dataset entries in the specified format.
