To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Analysis for the Rational Design of Anti-Amyloid Beta (Aβ) Antibodies" by D’Artagnan Greene et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on computational methods for analyzing anti-Aβ antibodies, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to binding affinities or structural data.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various antibodies and their binding affinities, which may indicate that they have utilized datasets from previous studies or experimental results.

In the **materials and methods section**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for molecular dynamics simulations or binding affinity calculations. The authors mention using MMPBSA binding free energy calculations, which implies that they may have datasets related to binding energies for different antibody-peptide complexes.

I will also check the **results section** for tables or figures that summarize data. For instance, there are tables that present MMPBSA binding free energies for various antibody-peptide complexes, which are crucial datasets for this study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies that the authors have referenced. This is important for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in their analysis.

Based on my review, I will compile the identified datasets, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **PFA1 and PFA2 Binding Affinities**: The authors present MMPBSA binding free energy calculations for various Aβ peptides bound to PFA1 and PFA2. The relevant citation for the original study that provided experimental binding affinities is:
   > Gardberg, A. S., Dice, L. T., Ou, S., Rich, R. L., Helmbrecht, E., Ko, J., Wetzel, R., Myszka, D. G., Patterson, P. H., & Dealwis, C. (2007). Molecular basis for passive immunotherapy of Alzheimer's disease. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 104(40), 15659-15664.

2. **Binding Affinities for Mutant Antibodies**: The study discusses the binding affinities of various mutants of the PFA1 antibody. The citation for the experimental data used for comparison is:
   > Gardberg, A. S., Dice, L. T., Ou, S., Rich, R. L., Helmbrecht, E., Ko, J., Wetzel, R., Myszka, D. G., Patterson, P. H., & Dealwis, C. (2007). Molecular basis for passive immunotherapy of Alzheimer's disease. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 104(40), 15659-15664.

3. **Gantenerumab and Crenezumab Binding Data**: The authors provide MMPBSA binding free energy results for gantenerumab and crenezumab. The relevant citation for the original studies is:
   > Ultsch, M., Li, B., Maurer, T., Mathieu, M., Adolfsson, O., Muhs, A., Pfeifer, A., Pihlgren, M., Bainbridge, T. W., Reichelt, M., Ernst, J. A., & Eigenbrot, C. (2016). Structure of Crenezumab Complex with Abeta Shows Loss of beta-Hairpin. *Scientific Reports*, 6, 39374.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for further processing or review.
