To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Revisit on Deep Hashings for Large-scale Content Based Image Retrieval" by Deng Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of deep hashing methods on various datasets, which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 600,000 images across 10 categories. It is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

2. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 700,000 images, also belonging to 10 categories. It is widely used for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

3. **Imagenet**: This dataset is significantly larger, containing over 1.2 million images categorized into 1,000 classes. It is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

To ensure accuracy, I will verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** where they are referenced again. The authors confirm that these datasets were indeed used for their evaluations, which solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
