To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ParaICL: Towards Robust Parallel In-Context Learning" by Xingxuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on. 

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **GSM8K**: A mathematical reasoning dataset consisting of high-quality math word problems.
2. **WinoGrande**: A commonsense reasoning dataset that improves upon the complexity of the Winograd Schema Challenge.
3. **ARC**: The AI2 Reasoning Challenge, which consists of grad-school level science questions in a multiple-choice format.
4. **HellaSwag**: A commonsense natural language inference task that tests the model's ability to predict the most logical continuation of a described event.
5. **MBPP**: A benchmark consisting of Python programming problems designed for entry-level programmers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **GSM8K**:

- **WinoGrande**:

- **ARC**:

- **HellaSwag**: 
  > Rowan Zellers, Ari Holtzman, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, and Yejin Choi. *Hellaswag: Can a machine really finish your sentence?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.07830, 2019.

- **MBPP**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
