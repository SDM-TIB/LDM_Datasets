To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GanglionNet: Objectively Assess the Density and Distribution of Ganglion Cells With NABLA-N Network" by Md Zahangir Alom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized for training or testing the proposed model. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Database)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, the authors mention that they collected a total of 12 High Power Field (HPF) samples for training and validation, specifying the image dimensions and magnification factors. This indicates that the dataset consists of histological images related to ganglion cell detection.

The authors also mention that ten samples were used for training and two for testing, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were annotated or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for citation.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors do not reference external datasets but instead describe their own dataset collected for the study. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: High Power Field (HPF) Samples for Ganglion Cell Detection
   - **Description**: A total of 12 HPF samples collected from patients with Hirschsprung disease, with images sized 2560Ã—1920 pixels. The samples were annotated by an expert pathologist using a single point annotation method.
   - **Citation**: Md Zahangir Alom, Raj P. Kapur, T.J. Bowen, and Vijayan K. Asari. "GanglionNet: Objectively Assess the Density and Distribution of Ganglion Cells With NABLA-N Network." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
