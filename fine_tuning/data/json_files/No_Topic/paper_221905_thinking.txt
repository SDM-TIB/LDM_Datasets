To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptually Motivated Method for Image Inpainting Comparison" by Ivan Molodetskikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of inpainting algorithms but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the need for evaluation in image inpainting but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Inpainting subjective evaluation)**, where the authors describe their subjective evaluation process. Here, they mention creating a **private set of test images** for their evaluation. This section is crucial as it details the dataset used for subjective comparisons.

In **section 3.1 (Test data set)**, the authors explain that they created their own dataset consisting of 33 images, specifically taken to ensure originality and prevent easy access to the original images online. They describe the characteristics of the images (512 × 512 pixels with a square hole of 180 × 180 pixels) but do not provide a formal citation since it is a private dataset.

Next, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 4.2 (No-reference metrics)**, the authors refer to the **COCO dataset** used for training their no-reference metrics. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets:

1. **Private Test Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and does not have a formal citation. However, I will note its characteristics:
   - Description: A private set of 33 images used for subjective evaluation of inpainting algorithms.
   - Citation: Not applicable (private dataset).

2. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
