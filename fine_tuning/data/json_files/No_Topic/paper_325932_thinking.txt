To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Validation and Transparency in AI systems for pharmacovigilance: a case study applied to the medical literature monitoring of adverse events" by Bruno Ohana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of AI for medical literature monitoring, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to biomedical literature.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Data Labelling)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their machine learning models. They mention that the dataset is built from a selection of publicly available abstracts from the biomedical literature, which is a crucial detail. I will look for specific information about the dataset, including how it was curated and any relevant statistics.

In this section, the authors explain that the training data was curated and labeled by pharmacovigilance specialists and that it consists of abstracts selected using predefined keyword searches. They also mention the total number of labels (n=20,531) and how the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to various sources, including guidelines and methodologies that may provide context for the dataset's creation.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **Biomedical Literature Dataset**: This dataset consists of abstracts from the biomedical literature, curated using keyword searches related to therapeutic compounds and adverse events. It includes a total of 20,531 labeled abstracts, which are used for training the AI system.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the references cited. Since the dataset is derived from publicly available literature, I will reference the relevant guidelines and papers that informed its creation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> U.S. National Library of Medicine. *Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in Cataloging*. National Library of Medicine (2010). Retrieved from https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/trainingcourses/mesh/intro_010.html.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any subsequent analysis or research.
