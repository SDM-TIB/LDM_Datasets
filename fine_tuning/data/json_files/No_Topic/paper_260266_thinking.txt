To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning for Noisy Data Streams Using Weak and Strong Labelers" by Taraneh Younesian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they evaluate their algorithm on well-known image classification datasets, specifically **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the challenges of labeling data and mention the use of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe how they injected noise into the labels of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are commonly used benchmarks in machine learning.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is a more challenging dataset due to the increased number of classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Cifar-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Cifar-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
