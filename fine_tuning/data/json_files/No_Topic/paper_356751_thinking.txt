To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImmunoLingo: Linguistics-based formalization of the antibody language" by Mai Ha Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets or sources of data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check for any sections that discuss the data used for training or validating the proposed model, ImmunoLingo. This could include descriptions of datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will ensure to capture their full names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the text, ensuring that I include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "the Antibody Database," I will search for its citation in the references, ensuring I capture it accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
