To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preventing Object-centric Discovery of Unsound Process Models for Object Interactions with Loops in Collaborative Systems: Extended Version" by Janik-Vasily Benzin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments. This is often where datasets are detailed, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any tables or figures that might summarize datasets, as they often provide concise information about the datasets used, including their size, type, and any relevant attributes.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in the research.
