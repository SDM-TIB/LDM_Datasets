To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Tool for Efficiently Generating Quality Estimation Datasets" by Sugyeong Eo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a tool for generating quality estimation (QE) datasets, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names or references.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for quality annotations and human post-edited sentences to produce data for QE training. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will continue to the next sections.

Next, I will examine the **Data Construction Process and Tool section**. Here, the authors describe the process of generating QE datasets from both monolingual and parallel corpora. They mention that the tool can create datasets based on user-selected language pairs and levels of granularity (word or sentence). However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in this section.

I will also check the **Acknowledgment and References sections** for any mentions of datasets or related works that may have used specific datasets. The references include various works related to quality estimation, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that some papers discuss quality estimation frameworks and methodologies, but they do not explicitly mention datasets that are publicly available or used in the experiments of this paper.

Since the paper focuses on a tool for generating datasets rather than utilizing existing datasets, it appears that there are no specific datasets cited in the paper itself. The authors emphasize the tool's capability to create QE datasets rather than relying on pre-existing datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the generation of QE datasets, it does not provide specific dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, as it primarily focuses on the methodology for creating datasets rather than utilizing established ones.

I will summarize my findings and document that no specific datasets were identified in this research paper.
