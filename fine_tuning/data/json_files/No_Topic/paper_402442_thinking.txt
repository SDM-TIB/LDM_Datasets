To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEVRER-Humans: Describing Physical and Causal Events the Human Way" by Jiayuan Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the **CLEVRER-Humans benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset focused on video reasoning for causal judgment of physical events.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the **CLEVRER-Humans dataset** is described in detail in the **methodology section**. The authors explain that this dataset is based on videos from the **CLEVRER dataset** and includes human-annotated physical event descriptions and causal relationships.

In the **dataset statistics section**, the authors provide quantitative details about the CLEVRER-Humans dataset, including the number of videos, event descriptions, and causal relationship annotations. This section confirms that the dataset is substantial and well-structured.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the original CLEVRER dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the CLEVRER dataset is as follows:
- Kexin Yi, Chuang Gan, Yunzhu Li, Pushmeet Kohli, Jiajun Wu, Antonio Torralba, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *CLEVRER: Collision events for video representation and reasoning*. In ICLR, 2020.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **CLEVRER-Humans Dataset**: This dataset is a human-annotated physical event description and causal reasoning dataset based on videos from the CLEVRER dataset.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the references, but it is the main focus of the paper.

2. **CLEVRER Dataset**: The original dataset that CLEVRER-Humans builds upon.
   - Citation: Kexin Yi, Chuang Gan, Yunzhu Li, Pushmeet Kohli, Jiajun Wu, Antonio Torralba, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *CLEVRER: Collision events for video representation and reasoning*. In ICLR, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and include the necessary citations for proper academic referencing. This will allow for accurate attribution and facilitate further research based on these datasets.
