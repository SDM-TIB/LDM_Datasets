To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling remote epidemic transmission in Western Australia and implications for pandemic response" by Michael Small et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an agent-based model for disease transmission, which suggests that there may be datasets related to population movement or community characteristics.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Modelling movement without movement data)**, where the authors describe the data they have used to inform their model. Here, they mention using data from the **2016 Census of Population and Housing** to categorize communities into language clusters and record the number of speakers of each language. This indicates that census data is a key dataset for their analysis.

In **subsection 2.1 (Data)**, the authors detail the specific data they collected, including the number of speakers of various languages across 369 communities in Western Australia. They also mention the population of these communities and their categorization into regions and local government areas. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **2016 Census of Population and Housing** as the source for their demographic data. The citation for this dataset is:

- **2016 Census of Population and Housing**: Australian Bureau of Statistics. *Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia - Stories from the Census, 2016*. Available at: https://www.abs.gov.au/census.

Additionally, the authors refer to their previous work in [6], which is relevant to the model they are using. The citation for this paper is:

- Small, M., & Cavanagh, D. (2020). Modelling strong control measures for epidemic propagation with networks â€” a COVID-19 case study. *IEEE Access*, 8, 103-113. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991234.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will include the census data and any other relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have the full citations for each dataset as required.
