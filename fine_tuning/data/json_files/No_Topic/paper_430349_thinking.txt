To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Discrete Disparity Volume for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation" by Jianwei Ren, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of monocular depth estimation and references various studies. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned here either. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the author mentions the use of the **KITTI dataset** for training and evaluation. This is a significant dataset in the field of depth estimation, and I will note its details. The author states that they follow the data split of Eigen et al. and provides specifics about the number of training and validation samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the context of monocular depth estimation. It consists of various driving scenarios and is widely recognized in the computer vision community.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for reference.
