To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning based electrical noise removal enables high spectral optoacoustic contrast in deep tissue" by Christoph Dehner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a deep learning approach that utilizes a large dataset of experimentally acquired pure noise and synthetic optoacoustic signals. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used for training and validation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Dataset-EN**: This dataset consists of simulated noise-free optoacoustic sinograms. It is used to train the deep learning model to remove electrical noise.

2. **Dataset-Ph**: This dataset includes measurements of pure electrical noise sinograms, which are used to validate the denoising performance of the model.

3. **Dataset-BC**: This dataset comprises in vivo scans of human breast lesions, which are used to evaluate the applicability of the denoising method in clinical settings.

4. **Dataset-GN**: This dataset consists of simulated white Gaussian noise sinograms, which are used to test the robustness of the denoising framework against different noise characteristics.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance and importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions that Dataset-Ph is based on a phantom, and Dataset-BC involves human subjects, which may require ethical approval citations. However, the specific datasets themselves may not have formal citations as they are derived from experimental setups and simulations rather than published datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will summarize them as follows:

- **Dataset-EN**: Simulated noise-free optoacoustic sinograms used for training.
- **Dataset-Ph**: Measurements of pure electrical noise sinograms used for validation.
- **Dataset-BC**: In vivo scans of human breast lesions used for clinical evaluation.
- **Dataset-GN**: Simulated white Gaussian noise sinograms used for robustness testing.

Since the datasets are not traditional published datasets with formal citations, I will note that they are derived from the authors' experimental work and simulations, and I will include the relevant details about their creation and use in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures all necessary information, ensuring that the descriptions are clear and concise for future reference or processing.
