To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mTREE: Multi-Level Text-Guided Representation End-to-End Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis" by Quan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the integration of textual pathology information with Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and indicates that the study uses datasets sourced from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). This suggests that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Data description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **TCGA-KIRC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 519 WSIs related to clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with region-of-interests (ROIs) provided for analysis. The authors note that they obtained 512×512 ROIs from diagnostic whole slide images, resulting in a total of 1251 images.

2. **TCGA-GBMLGG Dataset**: This dataset includes 1589 WSIs related to glioma, with 1024×1024 ROIs from diagnostic slides. The authors state that this data is publicly available on the TCGA database.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the TCGA database, which is a comprehensive cancer data consortium. The citation for the TCGA database is:

- For **TCGA**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **TCGA-KIRC Dataset**: Contains 519 WSIs related to clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with 512×512 ROIs from diagnostic whole slide images, totaling 1251 images.
   - Citation: Tomczak, K., Czerwińska, P., & Wiznerowicz, M. (2015). Review of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA): an immeasurable source of knowledge. *Contemporary Oncology/Współczesna Onkologia*, 2015(1), 68–77.

2. **TCGA-GBMLGG Dataset**: Includes 1589 WSIs related to glioma, with 1024×1024 ROIs from diagnostic slides.
   - Citation: Tomczak, K., Czerwińska, P., & Wiznerowicz, M. (2015). Review of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA): an immeasurable source of knowledge. *Contemporary Oncology/Współczesna Onkologia*, 2015(1), 68–77.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
