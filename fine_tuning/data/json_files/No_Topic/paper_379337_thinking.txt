To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplifying Content-Based Neural News Recommendation: On User Modeling and Training Objectives" by Andreea Iana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a unified framework for news recommendation, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this framework.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the shortcomings of existing models and the need for systematic evaluation. They mention that many personalized news recommenders are evaluated on proprietary datasets, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments. The authors state that they conduct experiments on the **MINDsmall** and **MINDlarge** datasets, introduced by Wu et al. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their evaluation.

I will then check the **experimental setup section**, where the authors provide statistics for both datasets. They mention that MINDsmall contains 51,282 news articles and 49,108 users, while MINDlarge contains 101,527 news articles and 698,365 users. This detailed information confirms the datasets' relevance and provides context for their use in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the MIND dataset is as follows:

- For **MINDsmall** and **MINDlarge**, the citation is:
  > Fangzhao Wu, Ying Qiao, Jiun-Hung Chen, Chuhan Wu, Tao Qi, Jianxun Lian, Danyang Liu, Xing Xie, Jianfeng Gao, Winnie Wu, and Ming Zhou. *MIND: A Large-scale Dataset for News Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3597â€“3606, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
