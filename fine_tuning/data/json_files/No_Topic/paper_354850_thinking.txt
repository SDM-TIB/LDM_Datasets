To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mmWave Beam Alignment using Hierarchical Codebooks and Successive Subtree Elimination" by Nathan Blinn and Matthieu Bloch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulations, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. If the authors mention datasets that are derived from other works, I will need to find the original papers to obtain the full citations for those datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to mmWave beam alignment, as the title suggests. If the authors mention any datasets used for simulations or comparisons, I will extract the following information for each dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples or features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the datasets are not explicitly named, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future use.
