To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tag Embedding Based Personalized Point Of Interest Recommendation System" by Suraj Agrawala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using the **TREC Contextual Suggestion data**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors discuss the use of the **TREC Contextual Suggestion Track (TCST) dataset** for empirical evaluation. They provide statistics about the datasets used in TCST during 2015 and 2016, which confirms that this dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the TCST datasets, including the number of requests, users, and POIs. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TREC Contextual Suggestion dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **TREC Contextual Suggestion dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. H. Hashemi, C. L. Clarke, J. Kamps, J. Kiseleva, E. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2016 Contextual Suggestion Track*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2016), Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, November 15-18, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
