To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Notion of Complexity for Theory of Mind via Discrete World Models" by X. Angelo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a framework for measuring the complexity of Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks and references five widely adopted ToM benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the adoption of ToM benchmarks in various fields, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. They mention five specific benchmarks: **ToMi, MindGames, Adv-CSFB, SocialIQA, and FANToM**. This indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they assess the complexity of these benchmarks. They do not provide detailed descriptions of the datasets here, but they confirm their use in the experiments.

Moving to the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly state that they tested their method on the five ToM benchmarks mentioned earlier. This reinforces that these benchmarks are indeed the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each of the datasets:

1. **ToMi**: The citation is:
   > Matthew Le, Y-Lan Boureau, and Maximilian Nickel. *Revisiting the Evaluation of Theory of Mind through Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 5871–5876, 2019.

2. **MindGames**: The citation is:
   > Natalie Sileo and Antoine Lernould. *MindGames: Targeting Theory of Mind in Large Language Models with Dynamic Epistemic Modal Logic*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1–10, 2023.

3. **Adv-CSFB**: The citation is:
   > Natalie Shapira, Mosh Levy, Seyed Hossein Alavi, Xuhui Zhou, Yejin Choi, Yoav Goldberg, Maarten Sap, and Vered Shwartz. *Clever Hans or Neural Theory of Mind? Stress Testing Social Reasoning in Large Language Models*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1–10, 2023.

4. **SocialIQA**: The citation is:
   > Maarten Sap, Ronan LeBras, Daniel Fried, and Yejin Choi. *Social IQa: Commonsense Reasoning about Social Interactions*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4463–4473, 2019.

5. **FANToM**: The citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
