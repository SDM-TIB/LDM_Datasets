To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inference and Sampling for Archimax Copulas" by Yuting Ng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, including any details about their size, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

In this paper, I anticipate finding references to datasets such as:

1. **Nutrient Intake Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of modeling dependencies between nutrient intakes. I will look for the specific citation related to this dataset.

2. **Monthly Rainfall Dataset**: The paper discusses modeling extreme rainfall data, which may also be referenced with a citation.

3. **Other datasets**: I will keep an eye out for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of experiments or comparisons with other methods.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the References section. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
