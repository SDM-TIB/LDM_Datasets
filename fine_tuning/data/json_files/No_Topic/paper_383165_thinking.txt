To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval" by Shashank Rajput et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their framework on three public benchmarks from the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, specifically focusing on three categories: 

1. **Beauty**
2. **Sports and Outdoors**
3. **Toys and Games**

I will also look for any additional details about these datasets, such as their statistics or characteristics, which are often included in the experiments section. The paper provides some statistics about the datasets, including the number of users, items, and average sequence lengths, which can be useful for understanding the datasets better.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the recommendation system community. The citation for this dataset is:

> Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897â€“908, 2013.

Since the paper does not provide separate citations for the specific categories within the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, I will use the citation for the original dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, which encompasses the three categories mentioned.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
