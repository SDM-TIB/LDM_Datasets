To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application and reduction of a nonlinear hyperelastic wall model capturing ex vivo relationships between fluid pressure, area and wall thickness in normal and hypertensive murine left pulmonary arteries" by Mansoor A. Haider et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or measurements.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of pulmonary hypertension and the need for biomechanical modeling. They mention using ex vivo measurements of vessel diameter and wall thickness changes, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Ex vivo murine data."** Here, the authors describe the data collected from control and hypertensive mice, including measurements of lumen area and wall thickness changes with increasing transmural blood pressure. They specify that the data includes 11 measurements for the relationship between vessel outer diameter and pressure, and 3 measurements for wall thickness, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to extract.

The authors reference a previous study by Tabima and Chesler [32] for detailed descriptions of the experiments and data. This is crucial as it points to the original source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the dataset used in this study, which is based on the work by Tabima and Chesler, the citation is:
  > Tabima DM, Chesler NC. *The effects of vasoactivity and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension on extalobar pulmonary arterial biomechanics*. J Biomech 43:1864-1869, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. **Murine data for control and hypertensive mice**: Measurements of lumen area and wall thickness changes with increasing transmural blood pressure.
   - Citation: Tabima DM, Chesler NC. *The effects of vasoactivity and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension on extalobar pulmonary arterial biomechanics*. J Biomech 43:1864-1869, 2010.

With this structured approach, I can ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
