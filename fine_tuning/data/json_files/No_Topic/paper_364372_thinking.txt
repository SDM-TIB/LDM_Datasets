To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Combined Approach of Process Mining and Rule-based AI for Study Planning and Monitoring in Higher Education" by Miriam Wagner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of data from campus management systems (CMS) and highlights the analysis of study paths, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **approach** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the AIStudyBuddy project and mention that they received access to CMS data from two Bachelor programs: **Computer Science** and **Mechanical Engineering** at RWTH Aachen University. This indicates that these two programs' datasets are relevant.

I will then check the **experiments** or **results** sections to see if the authors provide more details about the datasets used for analysis. The paper discusses various key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from the CMS data, such as success rates, number of attempts, and average study duration, which further confirms the use of these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from the CMS of RWTH Aachen University, and there may not be a formal citation for them as they are institutional data.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **CMS Data for Computer Science**: This dataset includes information about course enrollments, exam registrations, and student performance metrics for the Bachelor program in Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University.

2. **CMS Data for Mechanical Engineering**: Similar to the Computer Science dataset, this includes course-related data for the Bachelor program in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University.

Since these datasets are specific to the institution and not published in a traditional sense, I will note that they are internal datasets used for the AIStudyBuddy project.

Now, I will compile the information about these datasets, ensuring to include the context and details as described in the paper, while also acknowledging that formal citations may not be applicable for internal datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details accurately.
