To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How isotropic kernels perform on simple invariants" by Jonas Paccolata, Stefano Spiglera, and Matthieu Wyarta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been included in the experiments section. Sometimes, authors discuss datasets in the context of their findings or compare their results with those obtained from other datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is typically:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

If the authors mention another dataset, such as **CIFAR-10**, I will find its citation, which is usually:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or presentation.
