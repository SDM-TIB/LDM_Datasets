To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoMC: Automated Model Compression based on Domain Knowledge and Progressive Search Strategy" by Chunnan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that discuss **experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments: **CIAFR-10** and **CIAFR-100**. I will note these names as they are critical for the dataset extraction.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
- **CIAFR-10**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks with a specific model (ResNet-56).
- **CIAFR-100**: This dataset is also used for image classification tasks but with a different model (VGG-16).

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:
- For **CIAFR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Handbook of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, 1(4).

- For **CIAFR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Handbook of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, 1(4).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
