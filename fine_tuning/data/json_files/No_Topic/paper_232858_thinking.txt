To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meaning Guided Video Captioning" by Rushi J. Babariya and Toru Tamaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with the **MSDV dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide details about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **Microsoft Video Description (MSVD) dataset** as a collection of YouTube clips totaling 1970 videos, with an average length of about 6 seconds. Each video has multiple descriptions provided by different annotators, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, they also specify how the dataset is split for training, validation, and testing, which is important for understanding its application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSVD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Chen, D.L., Dolan, W.B. (2011). Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1. HLT ’11, Stroudsburg, PA, USA, Association for Computational Linguistics, 190–200.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Microsoft Video Description (MSVD) Dataset**: A collection of 1970 YouTube clips, each with multiple descriptions (approximately 40 captions per video). The dataset is split into 1200 videos for training, 100 for validation, and 670 for testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
