To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General 3D Non-Stationary Wireless Channel Model for 5G and Beyond" by Ji Bian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed model but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in 5G and B5G systems but does not explicitly name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several datasets indirectly through citations of previous works. For example, they mention the use of measurement data for comparison but do not provide specific dataset names or details in the text. Therefore, I will need to check the **References section** for any cited works that may contain datasets.

In the references, I identify several papers that could potentially contain datasets relevant to the study. I will extract the full citations for these papers to ensure that I have the correct references for any datasets mentioned:

1. For the **3GPP TR38.901 channel model**, the citation is:
   > 3GPP TR 38.901, V14.0.0, “Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz (Release 14),” Mar. 2017.

2. For the **WINNER II channel models**, the citation is:
   > P. Kyösti et al., “WINNER II channel models,” IST-4-027756, WINNER II D1.1.2, v1.2, Apr. 2008.

3. For the **ITU-R M.2135-1 guidelines**, the citation is:
   > ITU-R M.2135-1, “Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-Advanced,” Geneva, Switzerland, Rep. ITU-R M.2135-1, Dec. 2009.

4. For the **channel measurements conducted by Payami and Tufvesson**, the citation is:
   > S. Payami and F. Tufvesson, “Channel measurements and analysis for very large array systems at 2.6 GHz,” in Proc. EUCAP’12, Prague, Czech, Mar. 2012, pp. 433–437.

After identifying these references, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
