To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Least Squares in Small Space via Sketching and Bias Reduction" by Sachin Garg, Kevin Tan, and Michał Dereziński, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of sketching methods for least squares regression, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, features, and any relevant annotations.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **YearPredictionMSD dataset** for their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its size and purpose. The YearPredictionMSD dataset is a well-known dataset used for regression tasks, specifically predicting the year of a song based on its audio features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YearPredictionMSD dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, source, and publication year.

The citation for the YearPredictionMSD dataset is:
> Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. *LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2:27:1–27:27, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format.

In summary, I will:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for dataset mentions.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset details.
3. Check the references for full citations.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring proper citation format.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
