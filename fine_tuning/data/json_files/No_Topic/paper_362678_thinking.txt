To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Volume Bias of Soft Dice Optimized Segmentation Maps in the Context of Inherent Uncertainty" by Jeroen Bertels et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include references to datasets used for validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe four medical tasks, which likely correspond to different datasets. I will pay close attention to the descriptions of these tasks to extract the dataset names and their characteristics.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MO17 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 400 cases of lower-left third molar segmentation on panoramic dental radiographs, with images sized 224x224 pixels.

2. **BR18 Dataset**: This dataset includes 285 cases of whole brain tumor segmentation on pre-operative MRI, with images sized 120x120x78 voxels.

3. **IS17 Dataset**: This dataset contains 43 cases for the segmentation of post-operative infarctions based on pre-operative MRI data, with images in the size range of 115x115x62 to 120x120x78 voxels.

4. **IS18 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 94 cases for the segmentation of ischemic cores based on acute CT data, with images in the size range of 102x102x10 to 133x133x80 voxels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided for datasets, but I will look for any papers or resources that describe these datasets in detail.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the context provided in the paper:

- For **MO17 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **BR18 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **IS17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Winzeck, Arsany Hakim, Richard McKinley, ..., Greg Zaharchuk, Roland Wiest, and Mauricio Reyes. *ISLES 2016 and 2017-Benchmarking Ischemic Stroke Lesion Outcome Prediction Based on Multispectral MRI*. Frontiers in Neurology, 9(SEP), September 2018.

- For **IS18 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Robben, Anna M.M. Boers, Henk A. Marquering, ..., Aad van der Lugt, Robin Lemmens, and Paul Suetens. *Prediction of final infarct volume from native CT perfusion and treatment parameters using deep learning*. Medical Image Analysis, 59:101589, January 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
