To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BDEC: Brain Deep Embedded Clustering model" by Xiaoxiao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of the BDEC model for rs-fMRI-based cortical parcellation, which suggests that there may be datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly in **subsection 2.2 (HCP Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe the HCP S1200 release dataset, which is a large dataset comprising data from 1096 subjects. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

In this subsection, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including the types of images collected (T1w and T2w), preprocessing steps, and how the dataset was divided into training and test sets. This confirms that the HCP S1200 dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HCP dataset. The citation for the HCP dataset is typically attributed to the Human Connectome Project, and I will ensure to format it correctly.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **Caltech rsfMRI Dataset** mentioned in the **Ethical statement** and **Acknowledgements** sections. This dataset is noted to be obtained from OpenNeuro and is used in supplementary materials.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **HCP S1200 Dataset**: This dataset is described in detail in subsection 2.2 and is used for training and testing the BDEC model.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
