To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self-Play: Approach to Approximate Nash Equilibrium of Imperfect-Information Games" by Li Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithms in various games, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3 and section 4) in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments, the authors mention evaluating their algorithms in various games, including Othello and Leduc Hold'em. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or game configurations that can be considered datasets for the purposes of this extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for Othello or Leduc Hold'em, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that and provide as much detail as possible based on the information available in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
