To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Efficient Shrinkage Path: Maximum Likelihood of Minimum MSE Risk" by Robert L. Obenchain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the use of a benchmark dataset for calculations and visualizations related to ridge regression. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "TRACE Diagnostics"** where the author discusses the Portland cement dataset. Here, the author provides details about the dataset, including the number of mixtures (n = 13) and the predictor variables (ingredient percentages). This section is crucial as it explicitly describes the dataset used for the analysis.

The paper states that the Portland cement dataset contains characteristics of cement mixtures and specifies the outcome variable (heat evolved during hardening) and the predictor variables. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Portland cement dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Portland cement dataset**, the citation is:
  > Woods, H., Steinour, H. H., and Starke, H. R. (1932). “Effect of composition of Portland cement on heat evolved during hardening.” *Industrial Engineering and Chemistry*, 24, 1207–1214.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the Portland cement dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
