To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Stage Sparse Retrieval with Entity Linking" by Dahlia Shehata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **MS MARCO passage dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Methods** and **Experiments** sections. In the **Methods** section, the authors describe their experiments on the **MS MARCO passage collection**, which includes 8.8 million passages and over 500k pairs of queries and judged-relevant passages. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **MS MARCO Chameleons sets of obstinate queries**, which are subsets of the MS MARCO queries that are particularly challenging for retrieval systems. This indicates that these query sets are also relevant to the dataset discussion.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **MS MARCO passage dataset**, the citation is:
   > Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder, Andrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Alina Stoica, Saurabh Tiwary, and Tong Wang. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. (2018). arXiv:cs.CL/1611.09268.

2. For the **MS MARCO Chameleons sets**, the citation is:
   > Negar Arabzadeh, Bhaskar Mitra, and Ebrahim Bagheri. *MS MARCO Chameleons: Challenging the MS MARCO Leaderboard with Extremely Obstinate Queries*. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 4426â€“4435. https://doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482011.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
