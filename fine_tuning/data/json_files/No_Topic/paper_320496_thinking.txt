To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MPC-Based Real-Time Charging Coordination for Electric Vehicle Aggregator to Provide Regulation Service in a Market Environment" by Liling Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets or data sources that are critical to their analysis. The introduction discusses the role of electric vehicles (EVs) and mentions the need for data related to EV operations and market conditions.

In the **case study section**, the authors describe their evaluation methodology, which includes simulations based on a model of 1,000 EVs. They mention that the parameters for different types of EVs are generated based on a distribution in Table I. This table is crucial as it likely contains the dataset used for the simulations.

I will locate **Table I** in the paper, which outlines the parameters of different types of EVs, including arrival and departure times, required energy, and maximal charging rates. This table serves as a dataset for the simulations conducted in the study.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find any external datasets or data sources that the authors may have cited. The paper mentions using historical market prices and regulation signals from PJM, which is a significant dataset for their analysis.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **EV Parameters Dataset**: This dataset includes the types of EVs, their arrival and departure times, required energy, and maximal charging rates as described in Table I.

2. **Historical Market Prices and Regulation Signals**: The authors reference PJM as the source for historical market prices and regulation signals, which is essential for their simulations.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **EV Parameters Dataset**, since it is derived from the authors' own work, I will cite it as:
  > Gong, L., Guo, Y., & Sun, H. (2023). *MPC-Based Real-Time Charging Coordination for Electric Vehicle Aggregator to Provide Regulation Service in a Market Environment*. 

- For the **PJM Data**, the citation is:
  > PJM. “Data Miner 2 Tools for Public Data” [Online]. Available: https://dataminer2.pjm.com/list.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
