To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Control Schemes of Voltage Source Converters" by Fahmid Sadeque and Tareq Hossen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on control schemes for voltage source converters under abnormal conditions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the applications of voltage source converters but similarly lacks specific references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections discussing various control schemes and techniques. I will look for any references to experimental setups, simulations, or data collections that might indicate the use of datasets. However, the paper primarily discusses theoretical approaches and control strategies without mentioning specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

I will also check the **conclusion** section, which summarizes the findings and contributions of the paper. Again, it does not reference any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets or data sources. However, the references primarily consist of literature on control schemes, voltage source converters, and related topics, without specific datasets being highlighted.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets that need to be extracted or cited.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were identified in the paper "On Control Schemes of Voltage Source Converters" by Fahmid Sadeque and Tareq Hossen.
- The paper focuses on theoretical control schemes without referencing specific datasets for validation or experimentation.

This process highlights the importance of carefully analyzing each section of a research paper to identify any potential datasets, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such. In this case, the absence of datasets means there are no citations to compile.
