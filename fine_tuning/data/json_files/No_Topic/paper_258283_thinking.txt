To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-level Adaptive Training for Neural Machine Translation" by Shuhao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions improvements in translation quality on ZH-EN, EN-RO, and EN-DE translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **LDC Chinese-English Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.25 million sentence pairs from LDC corpora, which includes 27.9 million Chinese words and 34.5 million English words. The specific LDC corpora referenced are LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2004T07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T08, and LDC2005T06.

2. **WMT2016 English-Romanian Dataset**: This dataset includes 0.6 million sentence pairs and is a preprocessed version released by Lee et al. (2018). The validation and test sets are specified as news-dev 2016 and news-test 2016, respectively.

3. **WMT2016 English-German Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs with 118 million English words and 111 million German words. The validation and test sets are news test-2013 and news-test 2014, respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LDC Chinese-English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2004T07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T06. *Linguistic Data Consortium*.

- For the **WMT2016 English-Romanian Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jason Lee, Elman Mansimov, and Kyunghyun Cho. *Deterministic non-autoregressive neural sequence modeling by iterative refinement*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1173–1182, 2018.

- For the **WMT2016 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn, Mosab M. Al-Ayyoub, and others. *The WMT 2016 English-German and English-Romanian Translation Tasks*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–14, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding references from the paper.
