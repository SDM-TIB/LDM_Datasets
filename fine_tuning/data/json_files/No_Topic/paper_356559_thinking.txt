To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fractal Decomposition based Algorithm for Dynamic camera alignment optimization problem" by Arcadi Llanza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of image alignment and mentions the use of a Dynamic Optimization Algorithm (DOA) called Fractal Decomposition Algorithm (FDA) for aligning CCTV camera feeds. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using images obtained from a camera at different times, but they do not specify any formal datasets or provide names for any datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they focus on the optimization process and the results of applying FDA to camera alignment.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant. The references include:

1. Lucas and Kanade's work on image registration, which is foundational but does not provide a dataset.
2. Nakib et al.'s paper on a deterministic metaheuristic, which also does not mention a dataset.
3. Souquet et al.'s work on hyperparameter optimization, which again does not specify a dataset.

After reviewing the entire paper and the references, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments, nor did they provide any dataset names or citations.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors focused on a methodological approach without referencing specific datasets. Therefore, there are no citations to provide for datasets in this case.
