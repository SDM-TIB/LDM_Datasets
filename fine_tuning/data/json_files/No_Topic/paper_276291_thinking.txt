To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CopyCat: Many-to-Many Fine-Grained Prosody Transfer for Neural Text-to-Speech" by Sri Karlapati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention datasets used for comparison or evaluation, which is crucial for my extraction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly the subsection **3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention an internal US English dataset of long-form recordings, which consists of 35 hours of data recorded by 5 female speakers for training, and 6.5 hours of data from various sources recorded by 12 female speakers for testing. This is a significant dataset that I need to note.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **LibriSpeech dataset** for training the speaker classifier. This dataset is well-known in the speech processing community, and I will need to include it as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **internal US English dataset**, since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note its description as it is relevant to the study.

2. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proc. ICASSP, IEEE, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the descriptions and citations in a structured manner for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and verification of the datasets used in the research.
