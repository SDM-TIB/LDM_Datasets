To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GPU-Accelerated SIFT-Aided Source Identification of Stabilized Videos" by Andrea Montibeller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a "consolidated benchmark dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They refer to the **VISION dataset**, which is described as containing horizontal videos taken using Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS). This is a key dataset for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VISION dataset. The authors cite it as follows:

- For the **VISION dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Shullani, M. Fontani, M. Iuliani, O. Al Shaya, and A. Piva. *Vision: a video and image dataset for source identification*. EURASIP Journal on Information Security, vol. 2017, no. 1, pp. 1â€“16, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **VISION Dataset**: This dataset consists of horizontal videos taken using EIS, and it is used for evaluating the proposed method in the paper.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset and its citation.
