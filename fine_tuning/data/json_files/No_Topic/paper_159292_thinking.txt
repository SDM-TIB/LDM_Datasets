To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Glosses into Neural Word Sense Disambiguation" by Fuli Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results show the model outperforms state-of-the-art systems on several English all-words WSD datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to identify their specific names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Senseval-2 (SE2)**: A dataset from the Senseval competition, which is a standard all-words fine-grained WSD dataset.
2. **Senseval-3 (SE3)**: Another dataset from the Senseval competition, specifically task 1.
3. **SemEval-07 (SE7)**: A dataset from the SemEval competition, task 17.
4. **SemEval-13 (SE13)**: A dataset from the SemEval competition, task 12.
5. **SemEval-15 (SE15)**: A dataset from the SemEval competition, task 13.

The authors also mention that they use **SemCor 3.0** as the training dataset, which consists of 226,036 sense annotations from 352 documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Senseval-2**:
  > Edmonds, P., & Cotton, S. (2001). *Senseval-2: Overview*. In Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Systems.

- For **Senseval-3**:

- For **SemEval-15**:
  > Jurgens, D., & Pilehvar, M. T. (2015). *SemEval-2015 Task 13: Word Sense Disambiguation on Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2015).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
