To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-stream Convolutional Networks for Multi-frame Face Anti-spoofing" by Zhuoyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Replay-Attack Database**: This dataset consists of 1300 video clips of photo and video attack attempts on 50 clients under various lighting conditions.

2. **CASIA-MFSD**: This dataset contains 600 video clips, including genuine and fake face videos, with three types of fake face attacks.

3. **Oulu-NPU**: This dataset includes 4950 videos of real access and attack scenarios, with various presentation attack types.

4. **SiW**: This dataset provides 4,478 videos from 165 subjects, including both live and spoof videos.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure accuracy.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Replay-Attack Database**:
  > I. Chingovska, A. Anjos, and S. Marcel. *On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spoofing*. In Biometrics Special Interest Group, 2012.

- For **CASIA-MFSD**:
  > Zhiwei Zhang, Junjie Yan, Sifei Liu, Lei Zhen, and Stan Z. Li. *A face antispoofing database with diverse attacks*. In IAPR International Conference on Biometrics, 2012.

- For **SiW**:
  > Yaojie Liu, Amin Jourabloo, and Xiaoming Liu. *Learning deep models for face anti-spoofing: Binary or auxiliary supervision*. 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
