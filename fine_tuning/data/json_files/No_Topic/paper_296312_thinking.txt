To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Explanations for Model Inversion Attacks" by Xuejun Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the **Experiment Setup** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **iCV-MEFED**: This dataset is used for facial expression recognition, containing 6 emotions and 115 identities across 24,120 instances. The authors note that this dataset is crucial for their first use case involving emotion prediction from faces.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset consists of a balanced subset of 1,000 identities with 30,000 instances. It is used to test more realistic images and varied labels, focusing on facial identity recognition.

3. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 70,000 instances across 10 labels. This dataset is used to evaluate another use case involving explainable handwriting biometrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **iCV-MEFED**, the citation is:
  > Christer Loob, Pejman Rasti, Iiris Lusi, Julio CS Jacques, Xavier Baro, Sergio Escalera, Tomasz Sapinski, Dorota Kaminska, and Gholamreza Anbarjafari. *Dominant and complementary multi-emotional facial expression recognition using c-support vector classification*. In 2017 12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2017), pages 833–838, IEEE, 2017.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (celeba) dataset*. Retrieved August, 15(2018):11, 2018.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset used in the research.
