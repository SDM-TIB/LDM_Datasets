To extract datasets from the research paper titled "See the Unseen: Better Context-Consistent Knowledge-Editing by Noises" by Youcheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on two editing datasets: **zsRE** and **Counterfacts**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

For **zsRE**, the authors describe it as a question-answering task containing real-world facts. They mention that it is a prediction task and provide metrics for evaluating the editing effectiveness. 

For **Counterfacts**, the authors state that it collects factual statements to test the ability of adding counterfactual or specialized information. They also provide evaluation metrics for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **zsRE**, the citation is:
   > Levy, O., Seo, M., Choi, E., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017), Vancouver, Canada, August 3-4, 2017, pages 333â€“342. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For **Counterfacts**, the citation is:
   > Meng, K., Bau, D., Andonian, A., & Belinkov, Y. (2022). Locating and editing factual associations in GPT. In NeurIPS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
