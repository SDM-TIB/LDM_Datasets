To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedIN: Federated Intermediate Layers Learning for Model Heterogeneity" by Yun-Hin Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method does not rely on any public dataset, which suggests that the authors may not explicitly list datasets in the traditional sense. However, I will still look for any references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention conducting experiments on three public datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **SVHN**. I will note down these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: Contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Comprises 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.
3. **SVHN**: A real-world dataset containing 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images of house numbers.

I will also check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for these datasets are typically found in the context of their original publications. 

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms." 2017.

For **SVHN**, the citation is:
> Yu Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning." 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. Each dataset will be clearly labeled with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process.
