To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Parsing via Dense Recurrent Neural Networks with Attentional Selection" by Heng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors mention the use of three benchmarks for validation: **PASCAL Context**, **MIT ADE20K**, and **Cityscapes**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, specifically in section 4 (Datasets), the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **PASCAL Context**: This dataset contains 10,103 images annotated into 540 classes, with 4,998 images used for training and the rest for testing.

2. **MIT ADE20K**: This dataset consists of 20,000 images in the training set and 2,000 images in the validation set, with a total of 150 semantic classes.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset includes 5,000 images of street traffic scenes, with 2,975 images used for training, 500 for validation, and the remainder for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL Context**, the citation is:
  > R. Mottaghi, X. Chen, X. Liu, N.-G. Cho, S.-W. Lee, S. Fidler, R. Urtasun, and A. Yuille. *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

- For **MIT ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation.
