To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Monte Carlo search for conjecture refutation in graph theory" by Valentino Vito and Lim Yohanes Stefanus, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a novel algorithm and its application to refuting conjectures, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention using several conjectures for their experiments, specifically four resolved conjectures and six open conjectures. However, they do not refer to any specific datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or tabular data). Instead, they refer to conjectures and their corresponding mathematical properties.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the conjectures or algorithms used. The conjectures themselves are derived from previous works, and I will need to identify the original sources of these conjectures to provide full citations.

The paper mentions the following conjectures:
1. Conjecture 1 (Aouchiche & Hansen, 2010)
2. Conjecture 2 (Aouchiche & Hansen, 2016)
3. Conjecture 3 (Collins, 1989)
4. Conjecture 4 (Favaron et al., 1993)
5. Conjecture 5 (Liu et al., 2021)
6. Conjecture 6 (Liu et al., 2021)
7. Conjecture 7 (Aouchiche, 2006)
8. Conjecture 8 (Aouchiche, 2006)
9. Conjecture 9 (Aouchiche, 2006)
10. Conjecture 10 (Aouchiche, 2006)

Now, I will compile the full citations for these conjectures based on the references provided in the paper:

- For **Conjecture 1**:
  > Aouchiche, M., & Hansen, P. (2010). A survey of automated conjectures in spectral graph theory. *Linear Algebra and its Applications*, 432(9), 2293–2322.

- For **Conjecture 2**:
  > Aouchiche, M., & Hansen, P. (2016). Proximity, remoteness and distance eigenvalues of a graph. *Discrete Applied Mathematics*, 213, 17–25.

- For **Conjecture 3**:
  > Collins, K. L. (1989). On a conjecture of Graham and Lovász about distance matrices. *Discrete Applied Mathematics*, 25(1-2), 27–35.

- For **Conjecture 4**:
  > Favaron, O., Mahéo, M., & Saclé, J.-F. (1993). Some eigenvalue properties in graphs (conjectures of Graffiti — II). *Discrete Mathematics*, 111(1-3), 197–220.

- For **Conjecture 5**:
  > Liu, C., Li, J., & Pan, Y. (2021). On extremal modified Zagreb indices of trees. *MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.*, 85, 349–366.

- For **Conjecture 6**:
  > Liu, C., Li, J., & Pan, Y. (2021). On extremal modified Zagreb indices of trees. *MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.*, 85, 349–366.

- For **Conjecture 7**:
  > Aouchiche, M. (2006). Comparaison automatisée d’invariants en théorie des graphes. École Polytechnique de Montréal.

- For **Conjecture 8**:
  > Aouchiche, M. (2006). Comparaison automatisée d’invariants en théorie des graphes. École Polytechnique de Montréal.

- For **Conjecture 9**:
  > Aouchiche, M. (2006). Comparaison automatisée d’invariants en théorie des graphes. École Polytechnique de Montréal.

- For **Conjecture 10**:
  > Aouchiche, M. (2006). Comparaison automatisée d’invariants en théorie des graphes. École Polytechnique de Montréal.

Since the paper does not mention traditional datasets but rather mathematical conjectures, I will summarize the findings accordingly. 

In conclusion, I will compile the conjectures and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
