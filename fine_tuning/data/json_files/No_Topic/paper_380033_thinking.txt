To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention tunes gamma-band responses to faces" by Enya M. Weidner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on amygdala and cortical gamma-band responses to emotional faces, which may hint at the use of specific datasets related to emotional face processing.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **participants** and **stimuli** subsections. Here, the authors describe the participants and the facial stimuli used in the experiments. They mention that the stimuli were derived from the "FACES" database of the Max Planck Society, which is a crucial dataset for this study.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may have been used for analysis or comparison. The authors may reference other datasets or benchmarks that were utilized to validate their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. For the "FACES" database, I will ensure to find the original source and provide the complete citation.

The relevant datasets I have identified are:

1. **FACES Database**: This dataset includes facial expressions from various identities, which were used as stimuli in the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ebner, N. C., Riediger, M., & Lindenberger, U. (2010). Faces--a database of facial expressions in young, middle-aged, and older women and men: Development and validation. Behavior Research Methods, 42(1), 351â€“362. https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.42.1.351

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
