To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Mutual- and Self-Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Zhenxi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three medical datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is used for skin lesion segmentation and contains 2,594 images, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for polyp segmentation and consists of 1,000 polyp images, also divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **RIM-ONE Dataset**: This dataset is employed for optic disc segmentation and contains 485 images, with a specified distribution for training, validation, and testing.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **implementation details** section to ensure I have accurate information about how the datasets were used in the experiments.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**:
  > Codella N, Rotemberg V, Tschandl P, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368.

- For the **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**:
  > Jha D, Smedsrud P H, Riegler M A, et al. *Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset*. International Conference on Multimedia Modeling. Springer, Cham, 2020: 451-462.

- For the **RIM-ONE Dataset**:
  > Fumero F, Alay√≥n S, Sanchez J L, et al. *RIM-ONE: An open retinal image database for optic nerve evaluation*. The 24th International Symposium on Computer-based Medical Systems. IEEE, 2011: 1-6.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
