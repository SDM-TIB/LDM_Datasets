To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Power of Triply Complementary Priors for Image Compressive Sensing" by Zhiyuan Zha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will focus on sections that detail the experimental setup, as they typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for mentions of specific datasets. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets like "BSD68" or any other dataset, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of images, types of images, or specific characteristics that are important for understanding the dataset's application in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "BSD68 dataset," I will find the corresponding citation in the references, which is:
> P. Arbelaez, M. Maire, C. Fowlkes, and J. Malik. "Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 33, no. 5, pp. 898â€“916, 2010.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
