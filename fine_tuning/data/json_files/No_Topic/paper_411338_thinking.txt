To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cheap and Quick: Efficient Vision-Language Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models" by Gen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the validation of their method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **ScienceQA**: This dataset is described as a large-scale multimodal dataset for science question answering, covering various subjects and topics. It consists of text-only and text-image examples, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Alphaca-52k**: This dataset contains 52,000 text-only instruction-following examples generated by GPT-3.5.

3. **LLaVA-158k**: This dataset is a large-scale text-image instruction-following dataset, where the answers are generated by GPT-4.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the paper to ensure I have captured their descriptions accurately.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **ScienceQA**, the citation is:
  > Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tanglin Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan. *Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:2507â€“2521, 2022.

- For **Alphaca-52k**, the citation is:
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford alpaca: An instruction-following llama model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

- For **LLaVA-158k**, the citation is:
  > Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Qingyang Wu, and Yong Jae Lee. *Visual instruction tuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.08485, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
