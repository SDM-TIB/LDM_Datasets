To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Multiple Descent of Minimum-Norm Interpolants and Restricted Lower Isometry of Kernels" by Tengyuan Liang, Alexander Rakhlin, and Xiyu Zhai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including their characteristics and any relevant details.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the context of empirical evidence or experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation for it, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture both the dataset names and their corresponding citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
