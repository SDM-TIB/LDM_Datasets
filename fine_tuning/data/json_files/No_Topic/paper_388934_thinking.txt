To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Private Inference of Deep Neural Networks by Co-designing Activation Functions" by Abdulrahman Diaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their evaluation on various datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each, making it a more challenging dataset for classification tasks.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 14 million images across thousands of categories, widely used in the computer vision community.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and it's important to ensure that I have the correct and complete information.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, June 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
