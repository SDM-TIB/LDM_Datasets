To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-weighted Multi-view Sparse Reconstructive Embedding" by Huibing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might be using to validate their proposed method. This section may also provide insights into the types of data they are working with.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention five datasets: **3Sources, Cora, WebKB, Yale, and ORL**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of samples, the number of classes, and any specific features or views mentioned.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following citations:

1. **3Sources Dataset**: 
   > "3Sources dataset is collected from three online news sources, BBC, Reuters, and Guardian. It consists of features from 3 views and includes 169 samples from 6 classes." (Citation needed from the original source)

2. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > "Cora dataset is collected by 2708 scientific publications which come from 7 classes. Each document is represented by content and citation information." (Citation needed from the original source)

3. **WebKB Dataset**: 
   > "WebKB contains 4 subsets of documents over 6 labels, with each web page consisting of text, anchor text, and title text." (Citation needed from the original source)

4. **Yale Dataset**: 
   > "Yale dataset includes 165 faces corresponding to 11 people, with features extracted using multiple descriptors." (Citation needed from the original source)

5. **ORL Dataset**: 
   > "ORL dataset consists of 400 faces corresponding to 40 people, with features extracted using multiple descriptors." (Citation needed from the original source)

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
