To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Profit shifting under the armâ€™s length principle" by Alex A.T. Rathke, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may provide context or mention datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets, such as **methodology, experiments, or results**. These sections often describe the datasets used for analysis, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper includes a **section specifically dedicated to datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain the most relevant information.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which they were used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant publication details.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented clearly and accurately.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to confirm its accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
