To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Starkit: RoboCup Humanoid KidSize 2021 Worldwide Champion Team Paper" by Egor Davydenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and subsequent sections for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their improvements and strategies but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and results sections** to look for any datasets used in their experiments or simulations.

Upon reviewing the **methodology**, I notice that the authors mention using a simulation environment (Webots) for their robot model. However, they do not specify any datasets directly related to training or testing their algorithms. Instead, they focus on the technical aspects of their robot's design and performance in the RoboCup competition.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or related works. The references include various papers, but they primarily focus on algorithms and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation in their work. Instead, they focused on their robot's performance in a simulated environment and the technical innovations they implemented.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none explicitly mentioned. However, I will note that the authors utilized simulation data from Webots, which is a widely recognized platform for robotic simulations, but this does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

In conclusion, while I have followed the necessary steps to extract datasets from the paper, I found that there were no specific datasets referenced. I will document this finding accordingly.
