To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Dimensional Forecasting in the Presence of Unit Roots and Cointegration" by Stephan Smeekes and Etienne Wijler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical applications sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses empirical applications, which suggests that datasets will be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "two big data applications" and refer to the **FRED-MD dataset** and a dataset constructed from **Google Trends** for unemployment-related search terms. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **empirical applications section**. Here, the authors provide more context about the datasets:

1. **FRED-MD Dataset**: This dataset is used for forecasting several U.S. macroeconomic variables. It is described as a well-established and popular source for macroeconomic forecasting, which allows for evaluation in a controlled environment.

2. **Google Trends Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from search terms related to unemployment and is used for nowcasting unemployment figures. The authors mention that it consists of about one hundred unemployment-related queries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FRED-MD dataset**, the citation is:
  > McCracken, M. W., & Ng, S. (2016). FRED-MD: A monthly database for macroeconomic research. *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, 34(4), 574â€“589.

- For the **Google Trends dataset**, while there may not be a formal citation in the references, the authors mention that the data is publicly available through Google Trends. Therefore, I will note it as:
  > Google Trends. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://trends.google.com/trends

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations as required.
