To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DFS: Deformable Dense Depth Fusion and Segmentation for Object Reconstruction from a Handheld Camera" by Tanmay Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating 3D reconstructions on the **Object-Videos dataset** and the **RGBD Scenes V2 dataset**, indicating that these are key datasets for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about their evaluation methods. They specifically mention using the **Object-Videos dataset** for qualitative evaluations and the **RGBD Scenes V2 dataset** for quantitative evaluations of dense depth estimation. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their experiments.

In the **Object-Videos dataset**, the authors describe it as consisting of 12 videos of 10 objects captured using a mobile phone camera. This dataset is used to evaluate the 3D reconstruction and segmentation methods proposed in the paper.

For the **RGBD Scenes V2 dataset**, the authors reference the work by Henry et al. (2013), which provides a clear indication of the dataset's origin and its purpose in their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Object-Videos dataset**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Gupta, T., Shin, D., Sivagnanadasan, N., & Hoiem, D. (2023). *3DFS: Deformable Dense Depth Fusion and Segmentation for Object Reconstruction from a Handheld Camera*. University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. [Dataset available upon request].

2. For the **RGBD Scenes V2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Henry, P., Fox, D., Bhowmik, A., & Mongia, R. (2013). *Patch volumes: Segmentation-based consistent mapping with RGB-D cameras*. In 3D Vision-3DV 2013, 2013 International Conference on, IEEE, 398â€“405.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
