To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Limits on Inferring T-cell Specificity from Partial Information" by James Henderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors utilize "two recent datasets that have sequenced TCRs specific to a dozen viral MHC class I epitopes." This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention combining TCRs specific to nine SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from Minervina et al. and TCRs specific to three epitopes from Dash et al. This gives me the names of two datasets that are crucial for their analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a table (Table I) that lists the TCR sequence data used in the study, including the epitope IDs, datasets, and sequence counts. This table is essential for extracting detailed information about the datasets.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Minervina Dataset**: This dataset includes TCRs specific to nine SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. A. Minervina, M. V. Pogorelyy, A. M. Kirk, J. C. Crawford, E. K. Allen, C.-H. Chou, R. C. Mettelman, K. J. Allison, C.-Y. Lin, D. C. Brice, et al., *Nature Immunology*, 23, 781 (2022).

2. **Dash Dataset**: This dataset contains TCRs specific to three epitopes from other viruses. The citation for this dataset is:
   > P. Dash, A. J. Fiore-Gartland, T. Hertz, G. C. Wang, S. Sharma, A. Souquette, J. C. Crawford, E. B. Clemens, T. H. Nguyen, K. Kedzierska, et al., *Nature*, 547, 89 (2017).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are critical for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for future reference.
