To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Partial Label Learning" by Yunfeng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark few-shot datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using two benchmark datasets: **Omniglot** and **miniImageNet**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup subsection (4.1)**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They describe **Omniglot** as consisting of 1,623 handwritten characters collected from 50 alphabets, with each character including 20 instances drawn by different subjects. They also mention that the dataset was resized and augmented for the experiments. For **miniImageNet**, they state that it is collected from the larger ILSVRC-12 dataset and consists of 100 classes with 600 examples per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I will extract are:

1. For **Omniglot**:
   > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., Gross, J., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2011). One-shot learning of simple visual concepts. In Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pages 2568–2573.

2. For **miniImageNet**:
   > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one-shot learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 3630–3638.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
