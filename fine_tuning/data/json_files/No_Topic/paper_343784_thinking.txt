To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed Federated Learning: Joint Decentralized and Centralized Learning" by Sean Augenstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors mention three tasks and the datasets associated with each:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: Used for the smile classification task. The paper states that the dataset consists of images of faces, with a focus on smiling and unsmiling faces.

2. **Stack Overflow Dataset**: This dataset is used for the language modeling task. It consists of text data from Stack Overflow, which is relevant for training models that predict text sequences.

3. **MovieLens Dataset**: Utilized for the movie recommendation task. The dataset contains user ratings for movies, which is essential for training recommendation algorithms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **Stack Overflow Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Stack Overflow Data*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow.

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**:
  > F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1â€“19, 2015. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
