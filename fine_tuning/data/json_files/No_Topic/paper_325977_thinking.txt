To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning-accelerated computational solid mechanics: Application to linear elasticity" by Rajat Arora, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel physics-informed deep learning framework for reconstructing high-resolution deformation fields from low-resolution data. This suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to the low-resolution and high-resolution deformation fields.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Results & Discussion)**, where the author discusses the application of the framework to resolve stress and displacement fields. Here, the author mentions that the ground truth data is generated by solving the governing equations on a coarse mesh using the Finite Element Method. This indicates that there is a dataset involved in the form of simulation results.

In this section, the author specifies that the data is randomly split in an 80:20 ratio for training and testing purposes. However, the specific names of datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the text. I will need to look for any references to datasets in the **References section** to find authoritative citations.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I find that there are no specific datasets cited directly. However, the author mentions that the source code and dataset used in this research can be found at a GitHub repository (https://github.com/sairajat/SR_LE). This indicates that the dataset is likely associated with the code provided in the repository.

To summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Low-Resolution Data**: This data is obtained from simulations on a coarse mesh, which is used as input for the super-resolution framework.
2. **High-Resolution Data**: This is the ground truth data generated from the Finite Element Method, which serves as a reference for evaluating the performance of the super-resolution models.

Since the paper does not provide specific names or citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the author's simulations and methods described in the paper. The GitHub repository may contain additional details about the datasets used.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, including the relevant citations and links, into a structured format for further processing or review.
