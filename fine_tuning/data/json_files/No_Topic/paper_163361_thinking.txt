To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study of Recent Contributions on Information Extraction" by Parisa Naderi Golshan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on Information Extraction (IE) and its sub-tasks, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). Here, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. 

In the methods section, I find that several references are made to datasets used in various studies. For instance, the **Clinical TempEval corpus** is mentioned in the context of NER, and the **GENIA corpus** is referenced for biomedical named entity recognition. Additionally, the **ISNA corpus** is noted as a source for news articles in the context of NER.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Clinical TempEval corpus**:
   - Citation: 
     > Geetha, S., Mala, G. A., & Kanya, N. (2011). A survey on information extraction using entity relation based methods. In International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Intelligent System, Tamil Nadu.

2. **GENIA corpus**:
   - Citation:
     > T. H. Nguyen, R. Grishman. (2015). Relation Extraction: Perspective from Convolutional Neural Networks. In VS@ HLT-NAACL, pp. 39-48.

3. **ISNA corpus**:
   - Citation:
     > H. Eghbalzadeh, B. Hosseini, S. Khadivi, & A. Khodabakhsh. (2012). Persica: A Persian corpus for multi-purpose text mining and Natural language processing. In Sixth International Symposium on Telecommunications (IST), Tehran.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or research based on this work.
