To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Unlearning via Null Space Calibration" by Huiqiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the datasets used in the experiments, so I will pay close attention to this section.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they validate their method on several benchmarks, specifically **FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
4. **SVHN**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
