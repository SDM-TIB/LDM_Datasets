To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metabolic cascades of energy" by M.A. Fardin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **"Methods," "Data," or "Experiments."** In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets related to metabolic rates or energy expenditure of organisms, I will ensure to capture the specifics of these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources that are cited in relation to the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets derived from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset compiled from various studies on metabolic rates, I will find the original studies and cite them accordingly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is clear and correctly cited.
