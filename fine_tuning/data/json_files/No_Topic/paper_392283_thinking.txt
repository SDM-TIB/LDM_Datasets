To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Anomaly Detection in PPG Data using Representation Learning and Biometric Identification" by Ramin Ghorbani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach using two different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Pulse Transit Time PPG (PTT-PPG) Dataset**: This dataset is described as a high-resolution and time-synchronized dataset annotated with activity labels, containing waveform records from multi-wavelength sensors measuring PPGs. It includes recordings from 22 healthy subjects performing different physical activities.

2. **PPG-Dalia Dataset**: This dataset is collected to perform PPG-based heart rate estimation and includes recordings from 15 subjects performing various daily activities. The authors note that they removed data from one subject due to incomplete recordings.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations provided in the references for these datasets are:

- For the **Pulse Transit Time PPG (PTT-PPG) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philip Mehrgardt, Matloob Khushi, Simon Poon, and Anusha Withana. *Pulse transit time PPG dataset*, 2022.

- For the **PPG-Dalia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Attila Reiss, Ina Indlekofer, Philip Schmidt, and Kristof Van Laerhoven. *Deep PPG: large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks*. Sensors, 19(14):3079, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Pulse Transit Time PPG (PTT-PPG) Dataset**
   - Citation: Philip Mehrgardt, Matloob Khushi, Simon Poon, and Anusha Withana. *Pulse transit time PPG dataset*, 2022.

2. **PPG-Dalia Dataset**
   - Citation: Attila Reiss, Ina Indlekofer, Philip Schmidt, and Kristof Van Laerhoven. *Deep PPG: large-scale heart rate estimation with convolutional neural networks*. Sensors, 19(14):3079, 2019.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for future reference or processing.
