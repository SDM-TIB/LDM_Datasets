To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Part-Guided Attention Learning for Vehicle Instance Retrieval" by Xinyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four large-scale benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the subsection titled **"Datasets and Evaluation Metrics."** Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **VeRi-776**: This dataset contains approximately 50,000 images of 776 vehicle identities captured across 20 cameras, with variations in viewpoints, illumination, and occlusions.

2. **VehicleID**: A widely-used dataset comprising 221,763 images of 26,267 vehicles, where each vehicle has either a front or rear view.

3. **VRIC**: This dataset includes 60,430 images of 5,622 vehicle identities, captured from 60 different traffic cameras under various conditions.

4. **VERI-Wild**: A recently released dataset with 416,314 vehicle images of 40,671 IDs, collected from 174 cameras, featuring significant variations in resolution, illumination, and occlusion.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **VeRi-776**, the citation is:

- For **VehicleID**, the citation is:

- For **VRIC**, the citation is:

- For **VERI-Wild**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
