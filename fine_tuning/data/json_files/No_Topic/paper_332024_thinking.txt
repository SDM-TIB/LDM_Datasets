To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Super-Resolution Methods: A Survey" by Bahattin Can Maral, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing methods and experiments** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the topic but may not specify datasets. The introduction may mention the need for datasets in the context of super-resolution, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and discussion sections** where the author might describe specific datasets used in the studies or experiments referenced. I will look for any mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of the various super-resolution methods discussed.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named. For example, if the author discusses the use of a specific dataset for training or evaluating a super-resolution model, I will highlight that.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If a dataset is referenced in the context of a specific study or method, I will ensure to capture the citation from the references provided.

In this paper, I expect to find references to well-known datasets commonly used in image super-resolution research, such as:

1. **Set5**: A commonly used dataset for evaluating super-resolution algorithms, consisting of five images.
2. **Set14**: Another popular dataset that includes 14 images for testing super-resolution methods.
3. **BSD100**: A dataset containing 100 images from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, often used for benchmarking super-resolution techniques.

Once I identify these datasets, I will retrieve their full citations from the references section. For example, if the paper references the Set5 dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset and provide its citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
