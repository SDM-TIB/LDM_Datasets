To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModaNet: A Large-scale Street Fashion Dataset with Polygon Annotations" by Shuai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the "ModaNet" dataset, which is a large-scale collection of street fashion images. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the "ModaNet" dataset in detail in **section 3 (The ModaNet Dataset)**. Here, they provide comprehensive statistics about the dataset, including the number of images, types of annotations, and the categories included.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **ModaNet**: This dataset consists of 55,176 fully annotated street fashion images, which include pixel-level segmentation masks and polygon annotations for various fashion items. The dataset aims to facilitate research in object detection, semantic segmentation, and polygon prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the "ModaNet" dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Shuai Zheng, Fan Yang, M. Hadi Kiapour, and Robinson Piramuthu. 2018. *ModaNet: A Large-scale Street Fashion Dataset with Polygon Annotations*. In MM ’18: 2018 ACM Multimedia Conference, Oct. 22–26, 2018, Seoul, Republic of Korea, Jennifer B. Sartor, Theo D’Hondt, and Wolfgang De Meuter (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240652

Since "ModaNet" is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
