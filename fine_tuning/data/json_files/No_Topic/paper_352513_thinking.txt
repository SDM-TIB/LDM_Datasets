To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-shot Generative Prior in Hankel-k-space for Parallel Imaging Reconstruction" by Hong Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the **SIAT dataset**, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using brain images from the **SIAT dataset**, which includes 500 2D complex-valued MR images. They also specify that informed consent was obtained from the subjects, which is important for ethical considerations.

In this section, the authors also refer to two additional datasets:
1. **12-channel T2 transversal Brain dataset**: This dataset is collected from a reference [46], which I will need to look up for the full citation.
2. **8-channel T1 GE Brain dataset**: This dataset is also referenced from [6], and I will need to find its citation as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SIAT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, S., Tan, S., Gao, Y., Liu, Q., Ying, L., Xiao, T., Liu, Y., Liu, X., Zheng, H., & Liang, D. (2017). Learning joint-sparse codes for calibration-free parallel MR imaging. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(1), 251-261.

- For the **12-channel T2 transversal Brain dataset**, the citation is:
  > Uecker, M., Lai, P., Murphy, M. J., et al. (2014). ESPIRiTâ€”an eigenvalue approach to autocalibrating parallel MRI: where SENSE meets GRAPPA. *Magnetic Resonance in Medicine*, 71(3), 990-1001.

- For the **8-channel T1 GE Brain dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shin, P. J., Larson, P. E., Ohliger, M. A., et al. (2014). Calibrationless parallel imaging reconstruction based on structured low-rank matrix completion. *Magnetic Resonance in Medicine*, 72(4), 959-970.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **SIAT Dataset**: A collection of 500 2D complex-valued MR images used for training and testing.
2. **12-channel T2 Transversal Brain Dataset**: Collected from a 3.0T Siemens MRI system, used for comparison in experiments.
3. **8-channel T1 GE Brain Dataset**: Acquired using a T1-weighted 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence, also used for comparison.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
