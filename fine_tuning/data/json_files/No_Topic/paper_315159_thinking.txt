To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Economic Resources, Lobbying Capacity and Group Type Shape Lobbying Influence" by Fintan Oeri, Adrian Rinscheid, and Aya Kachi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets or data sources used in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their data collection process. In this paper, they mention that the empirical analysis is based on data from an original survey with **312 Swiss energy policy stakeholders** and document data from multiple policy consultation submission processes. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: the survey data and the document data.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets in the **results section** and any tables or figures that summarize the data. The authors discuss their findings based on the survey responses and the consultation submissions, which will help me understand the nature of the datasets.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Survey Data**: This dataset consists of responses from **312 Swiss energy policy stakeholders** collected through a survey. The survey aimed to assess self-perceived influence, reputational influence, and political budget among other variables.

2. **Consultation Submission Data**: This dataset includes document data from policy consultation processes related to the **Energiestrategie 2050** and **Klimapolitik nach 2020**. The authors used publicly available consultation submissions to determine preference attainment measures.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies referenced in the paper. However, since the datasets mentioned are original to this study, I will focus on citing the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Oeri, F., Rinscheid, A., & Kachi, A. (2023). How Economic Resources, Lobbying Capacity and Group Type Shape Lobbying Influence. *[Journal Name]*, [Volume(Issue)], [Page Range]. DOI: [DOI]

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations. Each dataset will be clearly labeled with its name, a brief description, and the citation for the paper.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entries are well-organized and ready for any further analysis or reporting.
