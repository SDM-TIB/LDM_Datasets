To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social Learning under Platform Influence: Consensus and Persistent Disagreement" by Ozan Candogan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **political blogs data collected by Adamic and Glance (2005)**. I will note this dataset as it is crucial for the analysis presented in the paper. The authors describe how this dataset consists of agents labeled as liberal (left) and conservative (right) based on their political blogs, and they constructed connections between agents using blog activity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the political blogs dataset. The citation for the dataset is:

- Adamic, L. A., & Glance, N. (2005). *The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election: divided they blog*. In Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Link discovery (pp. 36â€“43).

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of numerical simulations or theoretical analyses. If the authors refer to any synthetic datasets or models used for simulations, I will document those as well.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
