To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retweet-BERT: Political Leaning Detection Using Language Features and Information Diffusion on Social Networks" by Julie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on "two recent Twitter datasets (a COVID-19 dataset and a 2020 United States presidential elections dataset)," which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **COVID-19 Twitter Dataset**: This dataset was collected from January to July 2020 and includes tweets from 232,000 active users. The authors state that all tweets contain COVID-related keywords.

2. **2020 Presidential Elections Dataset**: This dataset was collected from March to May 2020 and includes tweets related to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.

Both datasets are described as publicly available, which is important for reproducibility and further research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference two papers that provide details about the datasets:

- For the **COVID-19 Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, E., Lerman, K., & Ferrara, E. (2020). Tracking social media discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic: Development of a public Coronavirus Twitter data set. *JMIR Public Health Surveill.*, 6(2), e19273.

- For the **2020 Presidential Elections Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, E., Deb, A., & Ferrara, E. (2021). #Election2020: The first public Twitter dataset on the 2020 US Presidential election. *J. Comput. Soc. Sci.*, 1-18.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
