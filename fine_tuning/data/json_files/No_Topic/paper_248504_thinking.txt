To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Covariance-engaged Classification of Sets via Linear Programming" by Zhao Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the authors typically discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often details the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will focus on that to gather comprehensive details.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer back to the datasets when discussing their findings, which can provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the specific paper in question, I will look for the following datasets:

1. **Histopathology Image Dataset**: The paper mentions using a dataset of nuclei images from normal liver tissues and cancerous tissues. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of sets and images per set.

2. **Other Datasets**: If the paper references any other datasets, such as those used in simulations or comparisons, I will extract their names and details as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as found in the references section. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
