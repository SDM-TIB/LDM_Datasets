To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exponential Signal Reconstruction with Deep Hankel Matrix Factorization" by Yihui Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention the types of data used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using **synthetic exponential signals** for training their model. They describe the parameters of these synthetic signals in **Table S1-1** and **Table S1-2**, which detail the amplitude, damping factor, phase, and frequency of the synthetic signals used in their experiments. 

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of **real biological NMR spectroscopy data** in the experiments, specifically mentioning the **2D 1H-15N TROSY spectrum of Ubiquitin** and the **2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of CD79b**. These datasets are crucial for validating the proposed method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. For the **synthetic exponential signals**, since they are generated based on specific parameters described in the paper, they do not have a formal citation but are referenced in the context of the experiments.

2. For the **2D 1H-15N TROSY spectrum of Ubiquitin**, the citation is:
   > Huang, Y., Zhao, J., Wang, Z., Orekhov, V., Guo, D., & Qu, X. (2020). Accelerated nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with deep learning. *Angewandte Chemie International Edition*, 59(26), 10297-10300.

3. For the **2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of CD79b**, the same citation applies as it is part of the same study.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
