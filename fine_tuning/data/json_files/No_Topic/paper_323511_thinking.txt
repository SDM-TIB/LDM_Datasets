To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Wasserstein Gradient Flow" by Jiaojiao Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections in detail. These sections typically contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets, as they often provide detailed descriptions.

In the **results** section, I will look for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors compare their results across different datasets. This can help confirm the datasets identified earlier and may provide additional context or details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes:
- Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
