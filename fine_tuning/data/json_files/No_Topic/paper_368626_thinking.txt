To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical Machine Translation for Indic Languages" by Sudhansu Bala Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss the development of bilingual Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models for translating English to fifteen low-resource Indian languages and vice versa, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for model building and testing. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Samanantar Dataset**: This is described as the largest corpus collection for Indic languages, containing over 45 million sentence pairs in English and 11 Indic languages. The authors specify that it has been used for Assamese (AS), Malayalam (ML), Bengali (BN), Marathi (MR), Gujarati (GU), Kannada (KN), Hindi (HI), Oriya (OR), Punjabi (PA), Telugu (TE), and Tamil (TA).

2. **OPUS Dataset**: This dataset is noted as a large resource with freely available parallel corpora covering over 90 languages. It is specifically used for Sinhala (SI), Sindhi (SD), Urdu (UR), and Nepali (NE).

3. **Flores-200 Dataset**: This is a multilingual parallel dataset with 200 languages, used as a benchmark for testing. The authors mention that it consists of two corpora labeled “dev” and “devtest,” with specific lines for fine-tuning and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Samanantar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramesh, Gowtham, Sumanth Doddapaneni, Aravinth Bheemaraj, Mayank Jobanputra, Raghavan AK, Ajitesh Sharma, Sujit Sahoo et al. "Samanantar: The largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for 11 Indic languages." *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 145-162, 2022.

- For the **OPUS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tiedemann, Jörg. "Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS." In *Lrec*, 2214-2218, 2012.

- For the **Flores-200 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Costa-jussà, Marta R., James Cross, Onur Çelebi, Maha Elbayad, Kenneth Heafield, Kevin Heffernan, Elahe Kalbassi et al. "No language left behind: Scaling human-centered machine translation." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.04672*, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
