To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Victim Counts from Text" by Mian Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of extracting victim counts from text, which suggests that datasets related to crisis events may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Data** section (section 2), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **World Atrocities Dataset (WAD)**: This dataset is referenced as a source for extracting victim counts related to atrocities.
2. **Non-violent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes 3.0 (NAVCO)**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source for victim counts in the context of campaigns.
3. **European Media Monitor (EMM)**: This dataset is used for extracting victim counts from media reports.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **World Atrocities Dataset (WAD)**:
  > Philip A. Schrodt and Jay Ulfelder. *Political instability task force atrocities event data collection codebook*. Technical Report Version 1.1b1, Parus Analytics, 2016.

- For **Non-violent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes 3.0 (NAVCO)**:
  > Orion A. Lewis, Erica Chenoweth, and Jonathan Pinckney. *Nonviolent and violent campaigns and outcomes 3.0: Effects of tactical choices on strategic outcomes codebook*. Technical Report Version 0.9b5, Sie Cheou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy, University of Denver, 2016.

- For **European Media Monitor (EMM)**:
  > JRC Science Hub. *European media monitor (EMM)*. Technical report, Joint Research Center Science Hub, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications. This will ensure that the datasets are properly attributed and can be accessed by others interested in this research area.
