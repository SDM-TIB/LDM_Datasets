To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Axe the X in XAI: A Plea for Understandable AI" by Andrés Páez, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract does not mention any datasets directly, so I will proceed to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various models of explanation in the context of explainable AI (XAI) but does not specify any datasets. I will continue to the sections that discuss methodologies or experiments, as these are likely to contain references to datasets.

Next, I will look for sections that might detail experiments or case studies. If the paper includes a **methodology or experiments section**, I will focus on that, as it is common for authors to describe the datasets used in their research in these sections. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the author refers to specific datasets used in their analysis or examples, I will note these down carefully.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

If I find datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Clearly state the name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
3. **Full Citation**: Include the full citation for the dataset as it appears in the References section of the paper.

If no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
