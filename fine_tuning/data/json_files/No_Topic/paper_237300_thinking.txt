To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partially Observed Dynamic Tensor Response Regression" by Jie Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions two real applications: a neuroimaging dementia study and a digital advertising study, which suggests that datasets related to these studies will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context for their work. They mention the neuroimaging study involving MRI data collected from 365 individuals and the digital advertising study involving click-through rates for 80 advertisement campaigns. This indicates that specific datasets will be discussed in the context of these studies.

In the **methods section**, I will look for subsections that detail the datasets used. The authors describe the neuroimaging study in detail, stating that anatomical MRI data were collected for 365 individuals over a two-year period, with each image being a 32 × 32 × 32 tensor. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

For the digital advertising study, the authors mention that the click-through rates of 20 active users reacting to advertisements from 2 publishers were recorded over 80 advertisement campaigns. This dataset is also essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **results or experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the analysis and to gather any additional details that may be relevant.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Neuroimaging Dataset**: The citation for the dataset used in the neuroimaging study is:
   > Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). *http://adni.loni.usc.edu*.

2. **Digital Advertising Dataset**: The citation for the dataset used in the digital advertising study is:
   > Bruce, N. I., Murthi, B., & Rao, R. C. (2017). A dynamic model for digital advertising: The effects of creative format, message content, and targeting on engagement. *Journal of Marketing Research*, 54, 202–218.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
