To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discover and Mitigate Unknown Biases with Debiasing Alternate Networks" by Zhiheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of the **Multi-Color MNIST dataset**, which is a key dataset for benchmarking their method. This is a strong indication that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the **Multi-Color MNIST dataset** in detail, describing its purpose and characteristics. They explain that this dataset is designed to benchmark debiasing algorithms in a multi-bias setting, which is crucial for understanding the context in which it is used.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for evaluating gender bias mitigation results. This dataset is well-known and widely used in the field of computer vision, particularly for tasks involving facial recognition and attribute classification.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Multi-Color MNIST dataset**: Since this dataset is newly created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Li, Z., Hoogs, A., & Xu, C. (2022). *Discover and Mitigate Unknown Biases with Debiasing Alternate Networks*. [Dataset available at: https://github.com/zhihengli-UR/DebiAN].

2. **CelebA dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730-3738.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
