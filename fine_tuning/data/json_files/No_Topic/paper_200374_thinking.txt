To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PaloBoost: An Overfitting-robust TreeBoost with Out-of-Bag Sample Regularization Techniques" by Yubin Park and Joyce C. Ho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **seven datasets** to evaluate their proposed method. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide a table summarizing the datasets, including their characteristics, such as the task type (regression or classification), the presence of missing data, and the number of samples and features.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Friedman-Sim Dataset**: A simulated dataset for regression tasks with no missing data.
2. **Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing Dataset**: A regression dataset with 4,209 samples, available on Kaggle.
3. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: A regression dataset with 1,994 samples, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
4. **Amazon Employee Access Dataset**: A classification dataset with 32,769 samples, available on Kaggle.
5. **Pulsar Detection Dataset**: A classification dataset with 17,898 samples, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
6. **Carvana Dataset**: A classification dataset with 72,983 samples, available on Kaggle.
7. **BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Dataset**: A classification dataset with 114,321 samples, also available on Kaggle.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
