To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PWESUITE: Phonetic Word Embeddings and Tasks They Facilitate" by Vilém Zouhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the contribution of a task suite for evaluating phonetic word embedding methods, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **datasets section** of the paper. In this section, the authors provide a specific link to a dataset hosted on Hugging Face: **huggingface.co/datasets/zouharvi/pwesuite-eval**. This indicates that there is a dataset available for evaluation purposes related to their work.

I will also check the **evaluation suite** section, where the authors describe the tasks and the data used for evaluation. They mention using data from the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary** for English and a dataset from **CC100** for non-English languages. I will need to find the full citations for these datasets as well.

Now, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**, the citation is:
   > Carnegie Mellon Speech Group. 2014. *The Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary 0.7b*. Carnegie Mellon University.

2. For the **CC100 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wenzek, Guillaume, Lachaux, Marie-Anne, Conneau, Alexis, Chaudhary, Vishrav, Guzmán, Francisco, Joulin, Armand, and Grave, Edouard. 2020. *CCNet: Extracting High Quality Monolingual Datasets from Web Crawl Data*. European Language Resources Association.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
