To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Sense the World: Leveraging Hierarchy in Multimodal Perception for Robust Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Miguel Vasco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details the datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsection that discusses the data used for training and evaluation. In this paper, I will specifically check for any mention of multimodal datasets, as the title suggests a focus on multimodal perception.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets in the **evaluation section**:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels. It is a well-known benchmark in machine learning.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains images of human faces along with associated semantic attributes. It is commonly used for tasks involving facial recognition and attribute prediction.

3. **MNIST-SVHN Dataset**: This dataset combines images from the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) and the SVHN dataset (street view house numbers), providing a multimodal scenario for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
