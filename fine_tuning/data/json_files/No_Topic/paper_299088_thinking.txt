To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformal Prediction using Conditional Histograms" by Matteo Sesia and Yaniv Romano, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used for numerical experiments or evaluations. 

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets that might be used to validate the proposed method. The authors may mention specific datasets that are critical for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the datasets used for training and testing the models. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may provide additional context about the datasets, such as their size, source, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the content of the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Physicochemical properties of protein tertiary structure**: This dataset is referenced in the experiments and is used to evaluate the proposed method.
   - Citation: 
     > Physicochemical properties of protein tertiary structure data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure. Accessed: July, 2019.

2. **Blog Feedback**: This dataset is also mentioned in the experiments section.
   - Citation: 
     > BlogFeedback data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/BlogFeedback. Accessed: July, 2019.

3. **Facebook Comment Volume**: Another dataset used in the experiments.
   - Citation: 
     > Facebook comment volume data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Comment+Volume+Dataset. Accessed: July, 2019.

4. **Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)**: Several panels from this survey are referenced.
   - Citation for Panel 19: 
     > Medical expenditure panel survey, panel 19. https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-181. Accessed: July, 2019.
   - Citation for Panel 20: 
     > Medical expenditure panel survey, panel 20. https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-181. Accessed: July, 2019.
   - Citation for Panel 21: 
     > Medical expenditure panel survey, panel 21. https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-192. Accessed: July, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
