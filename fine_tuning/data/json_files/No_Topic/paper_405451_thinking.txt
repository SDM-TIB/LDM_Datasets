To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Sensor-Free Affect Detection: A Systematic Literature Review," I will follow a structured approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which is on sensor-free affect detection in computer-based learning environments (CBLEs). This suggests that there may be datasets related to student interactions and emotional states.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were collected. 

In this paper, the authors reference several studies that utilized various datasets for affect detection. For instance, they mention the use of data from different educational contexts, such as intelligent tutoring systems and game-based learning environments. I will note down any specific datasets that are explicitly named.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional datasets that may have been used in the studies reviewed. The authors might discuss the datasets in the context of their findings, which could provide further insights into their characteristics and relevance.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examine the results and discussion sections for additional datasets.
3. Note down specific datasets and their characteristics.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
