To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Aggregation-Free Federated Learning for Tackling Data Heterogeneity" by Yuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive numerical studies were conducted on several popular benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST)**: This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products categorized into 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR10**: A collection of 60,000 color images grouped into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **DomainNet**: A dataset containing 600,000 images across six domains (Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch), with data from 345 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2009.

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1406â€“1415, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
