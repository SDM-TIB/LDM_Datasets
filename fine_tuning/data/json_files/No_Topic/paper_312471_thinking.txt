To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoadAtlas: Intelligent Platform for Automated Road Defect Detection and Asset Management" by Zhuoxiao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the system but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the need for automation in road asset management but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (System Overview)** and **section 2.2 (Road Defect Detection and Segmentation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their models. They mention that they have **10,000 raw images** provided by the local government, which are unlabelled and represent the foreground of the car taken in Logan City, Australia. This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their model training.

The authors also mention that they arranged for five annotators to label these images with various classes of road defects, which suggests that this dataset is specifically tailored for their research on road defect detection.

In **section 2.3 (Road Marking Parsing)**, the authors refer to an existing benchmark dataset that contains various labelled road markings. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will need to look for it in the references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **10,000 raw images** dataset, since it is provided by the local government and not published in a formal dataset, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

2. For the **benchmark dataset** used for road marking parsing, I will refer to the citation provided in the references:
   - The citation for the benchmark dataset is:
     > Xinyu Huang, Peng Wang, Xinjing Cheng, Dingfu Zhou, Qichuan Geng, and Ruigang Yang. 2020. The ApolloScape Open Dataset for Autonomous Driving and Its Application. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 42, 10 (2020), 2702â€“2719.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Dataset 1**: 10,000 raw images from the local government, unlabelled, used for training road defect detection models.
- **Dataset 2**: ApolloScape Open Dataset, used for road marking parsing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.
