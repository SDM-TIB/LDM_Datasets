To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A psychophysical evaluation of techniques for Mooney image generation" by Lars C. Reining and Thomas S. A. Wallis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction may also provide context about the datasets, especially if they are well-known or widely used in the field.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for generating Mooney images. In this paper, the authors mention using the **THINGS dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose, the number of images, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the methods section, the authors describe the THINGS dataset as containing over 26,000 images belonging to 1,854 concept groups, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application in their research.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the THINGS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **THINGS dataset**:
  > Hebart, M. N., Dickter, A. H., Kidder, A., Kwok, W. Y., Corriveau, A., Van Wicklin, C., & Baker, C. I. (2019). THINGS: A database of 1,854 object concepts and more than 26,000 naturalistic object images. *PloS one*, 14(10), e0223792. doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223792.

Now that I have the dataset name and its citation, I will summarize the findings related to the dataset in a clear and concise manner. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
