To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection Dataset" by Alperen Kantarcı et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors present a novel dataset aimed at addressing biases in existing face mask detection datasets. This suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **related work** section. Here, the authors discuss various existing datasets, including MAFA, FMD, MFDD, and others. I will note down the names of these datasets as they are relevant to the context of the paper.

In the **proposed dataset** section, the authors introduce their own dataset, the **Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection (BAFMD)** dataset. They provide details about its composition, including the number of images and the demographic focus. This section is crucial as it contains the primary dataset introduced by the authors.

I will also check the **experiments** and **conclusions** sections to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are further details about the datasets used in their experiments. The authors compare their BAFMD dataset with other datasets like MAFA and FMLD, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations:

1. **Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection (BAFMD) Dataset**:
   - This dataset is introduced by the authors themselves, so I will cite it as:
     > Alperen Kantarcı, Ferda Oﬂi, Muhammad Imran, Hazım Kemal Ekenel. *Bias-Aware Face Mask Detection Dataset*. Preprint submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, January 11, 2023. Available at: https://github.com/Alpkant/BAFMD.

2. **MAFA Dataset**:
   - The citation for the MAFA dataset is:
     > Z. Wang, et al. *Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application*. arXiv:2003.09093, 2020. Available at: https://github.com/.

3. **FMD Dataset**:
   - The citation for the FMD dataset is:
     > B. Batagelj, P. Peer, V. ˇStruc, S. Dobriˇsek. *How to Correctly Detect Face-Masks for COVID-19 from Visual Information?* Applied Sciences 11 (5) (2021) 2070.

4. **MFDD Dataset**:
   - The citation for the MFDD dataset is:
     > Z. Wang, et al. *Masked Face Detection Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection, 2020.

5. **FMLD Dataset**:
   - The citation for the FMLD dataset is:
     > H. I. Eyiokur, H. K. Ekenel, A. Waibel. *Unconstrained face mask and face-hand interaction datasets: building a computer vision system to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19*. Signal, Image and Video Processing (2022) 1–8.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets discussed in the paper along with their full citations.
