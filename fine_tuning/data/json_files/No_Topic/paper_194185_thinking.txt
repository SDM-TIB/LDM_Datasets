To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse coding for multitask and transfer learning" by Andreas Maurer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments on **one synthetic and two real datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their numerical experiments. In **Section 4.3**, they mention using the **NIST dataset** for optical character recognition tasks. This dataset is composed of images of handwritten characters, which is relevant for their experiments.

I will also check **Section 4.4**, where they refer to the **Binary Alphadigits dataset**, which consists of binary images of digits and capital letters. This dataset is used for sparse coding experiments with missing pixels.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **NIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > NIST. *NIST Special Database 19: Handwritten Digit Database*. Available at http://www.nist.gov/srd/nistsd19.cfm.

2. For the **Binary Alphadigits dataset**, the citation is:
   > Roweis, S. T. *Binary Alphadigits Dataset*. Available at http://www.cs.nyu.edu/roweis/data.html.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
