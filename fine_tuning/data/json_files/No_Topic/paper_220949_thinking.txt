To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GarmNet: Improving Global with Local Perception for Robotic Laundry Folding" by Daniel Fernandes Gomes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention training and evaluating their model using the **CloPeMa Garment dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. Here, they describe the **CTU Color and Depth Image Dataset of Spread Garments**, which is divided into two groups: "Flat and wrinkled" and "Folded." They mention the number of examples in each group and the types of annotations included, such as stereo disparity and landmark coordinates.

I will also note that the authors mention merging both groups of the CTU dataset and extending its annotations, which is important for understanding how they utilized the dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CloPeMa Garment dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wagner, L., K.D., Smutn, V. *CTU Color and Depth Image Dataset of Spread Garments*. Tech. Rep. CTUCMP201325, Center for Machine Perception, K13133 FEE Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic (September 2013).

2. The **CTU Color and Depth Image Dataset of Spread Garments** is referenced in the same citation as above, as it is the dataset they adapted for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
