To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards an All-Purpose Content-Based Multimedia Information Retrieval System" by Ralph Gasser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a multimedia retrieval system called vitrivr, which suggests that various datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this system.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their user study. They mention assembling their own test collections and using specific sources for audio, images, and 3D models. This indicates that there are datasets that were utilized for the experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Test Collections)**, the authors provide a list of collections used during the evaluation. They mention:

1. **Pixabay**: A collection of images with 164,512 entries.
2. **OSVC (Open Short Video Collection)**: A video dataset with 200 entries.
3. **Freemusicarchive**: An audio dataset with 4,335 entries.
4. **Miscellaneous sources**: Additional audio sources with 62 entries.
5. **NTU 3D (1-4)**: A 3D model dataset with 4,003 entries.
6. **Thingiverse**: A 3D model dataset with 8,966 entries.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Pixabay**, the citation is:
  > Pixabay. *Pixabay: Free Images and Videos*. Available at: https://pixabay.com.

- For **OSVC**, the citation is:
  > Luca Rossetto, Ivan Giangreco, and Heiko Schuldt. *OSVC-Open Short Video Collection 1.0*. Technical report, University of Basel, Basel, 2015.

- For **Freemusicarchive**, the citation is:
  > Freemusicarchive. *Freemusicarchive: Free Music Archive*. Available at: https://freemusicarchive.org.

- For **Miscellaneous sources**, there is no specific citation provided, but it is noted as a collection of audio sources.

- For **NTU 3D**, the citation is:
  > Ding-Yun Chen, Xiao-Pei Tian, Yu-Te Shen, and Ming Ouhyoung. *On Visual Similarity Based 3D Model Retrieval*. Computer Graphics Forum, 22(3):223â€“232, 2003.

- For **Thingiverse**, the citation is:
  > Thingiverse. *Thingiverse: 3D Printing Community*. Available at: https://www.thingiverse.com.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
