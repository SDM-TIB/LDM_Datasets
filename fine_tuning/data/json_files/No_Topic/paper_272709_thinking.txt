To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Occupation Times in the Red of Lévy Risk Models" by David Landriault, Bin Li, and Mohamed Amine Lkabous, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or methodology**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data," or "Methodology." If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

If the paper discusses specific applications or examples, I will also check those sections for any datasets referenced. For instance, the authors might mention datasets in the context of their applications, such as in the sections discussing future drawdown or inverse occupation time.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to find their full citations. This information is typically located in the **References section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived. It is crucial to ensure that I provide the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to:
1. Spectrally negative Lévy processes.
2. Refracted Lévy processes.
3. Any specific applications mentioned in the paper, such as Parisian ruin or occupation times.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset identified in the research paper.
