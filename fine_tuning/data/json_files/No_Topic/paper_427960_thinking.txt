To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When SMILES Have Language: Drug Classification Using Text Classification Methods on Drug SMILES Strings" by Azmine Toushik Wasi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves drug classification using SMILES strings, which suggests that a dataset related to drug structures is likely used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention utilizing a drug dataset obtained from Meyer et al. (2019) for their analysis. This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being referenced, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will then look for any additional information in the **appendices** or **dataset sections**. In Appendix B.1, the authors describe the dataset's partitioning into training, development, and testing subsets, as well as the distribution of drug classes. This provides valuable context about the dataset's structure and its application in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this study is:

- For the dataset from Meyer et al. (2019), the citation is:
  > Jesse G. Meyer, Shengchao Liu, Ian J. Miller, Joshua J. Coon, and Anthony G. Gitter. *Learning drug functions from chemical structures with convolutional neural networks and random forests*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 59(10):4438â€“4449, Oct 2019. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00236. URL https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00236.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Drug Dataset**: This dataset is used for drug classification and is partitioned into training (70%), development (10%), and testing (20%) subsets. It contains 12 classes of drugs, including categories such as antiinfective, antineoplastic, and CNS.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review.
