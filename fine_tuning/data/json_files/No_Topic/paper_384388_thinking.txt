To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modified Gauss-Newton Algorithms under Noise" by Krishna Pillutla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of Gauss-Newton methods in various learning problems, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. In this section, the authors mention three setups: multi-output regression, structured prediction, and solving non-linear equations. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these contexts.

In the **multi-output regression** subsection, the authors describe a synthetic dataset generated from a multivariate normal distribution. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation, as this dataset is synthetic and created for the purpose of the experiments.

In the **structured prediction** subsection, the authors mention using images generated in the game Warcraft II for path planning tasks. This indicates a dataset derived from a specific source, but again, it is not a formally published dataset with a citation.

In the **solving non-linear equations** subsection, the authors refer to datasets from the LIBSVM repository, specifically mentioning the **ijcnn1** and **covtype** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are established datasets with proper citations.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the identified datasets from the **References section**:

1. **ijcnn1 Dataset**:
   > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(27), 1-27. Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.

2. **covtype Dataset**:
   > Blackard, J. A., & Dean, D. J. (1999). Comparative accuracy of artificial neural networks and discriminant analysis in predicting forest cover types. *Ecological Modelling*, 119(2-3), 231-242.

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will not include it in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
