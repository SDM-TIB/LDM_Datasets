To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Getting rich quick with the Axiom of Choice" by Vladimir Vovk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and subsequent sections where the methodology and experiments are discussed.

Next, I will look for any sections that explicitly mention datasets or data sources. In this paper, there may not be traditional datasets like those found in empirical studies, as the focus is on theoretical constructs and trading strategies. However, I will still check for any references to data used for simulations or examples.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will note their names and descriptions. If the paper refers to any external datasets or sources, I will ensure to capture their full citations as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper does not contain any datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the focus is primarily theoretical rather than empirical.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, if any exist.
