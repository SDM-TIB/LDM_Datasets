To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black-Box Safety Validation of Autonomous Systems: A Multi-Fidelity Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Jared J. Beard and Ali Baheri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulation-based safety validation and mentions a case study involving an adversary trained in a grid-world environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulation.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the authors describe a **4Ã—4 grid world environment** where the system under test interacts with the learner. However, they do not explicitly mention a dataset in the traditional sense, as the environment is simulated rather than derived from a pre-existing dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any relevant works that provide datasets related to the experiments. The references include various papers on reinforcement learning and safety validation, but they do not specifically cite a dataset.

Since the paper primarily discusses a simulation environment rather than a dataset derived from real-world data, I will note that the authors created their own simulated environment for the experiments. Therefore, I will summarize the experimental setup as the dataset used for the experiments, which is the grid-world simulation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Grid-World Simulation**: This is a simulated environment created for the experiments, where the system under test (the learner) interacts with obstacles (puddles) and aims to reach a goal while avoiding failures.

Since there are no traditional datasets with citations, I will note that the grid-world simulation is the primary experimental setup used in the paper.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry as follows:

- **Grid-World Simulation**: This is a custom simulation environment created for the experiments described in the paper. It does not have a formal citation as it is not derived from a pre-existing dataset.

I will ensure that this information is clearly articulated in the final output, emphasizing that the dataset is a simulation rather than a traditional dataset with a citation.
