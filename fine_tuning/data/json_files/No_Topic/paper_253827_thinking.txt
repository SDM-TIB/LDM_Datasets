To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PicoDomain: A Compact High-Fidelity Cybersecurity Dataset" by Craig Laprade, Benjamin Bowman, and H. Howie Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the development of the **PicoDomain dataset**, which is a compact collection of Zeek logs from a realistic intrusion scenario. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the dataset, particularly the **data collection** section and any sections that discuss experiments or evaluations. In the **data collection section**, the authors describe the **PicoDomain dataset** in detail, including its composition of Zeek logs and adversary activity logs over a three-day campaign. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PicoDomain dataset**. The authors provide a link to the dataset's GitHub repository, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the **PicoDomain dataset** is:
> Craig Laprade, Benjamin Bowman, and H. Howie Huang. *PicoDomain: A Compact High-Fidelity Cybersecurity Dataset*. Available: https://github.com/iHeartGraph/PicoDomain.

Additionally, the paper references other datasets, such as the **LANL Comprehensive Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events Dataset**. I will extract the citation for this dataset as well, which is mentioned in the references section:
> A. D. Kent. *Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cybersecurity Events*. Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2015. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.17021/1179829.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. The key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **PicoDomain Dataset**: A compact high-fidelity collection of Zeek logs from a realistic intrusion scenario.
   - Citation: Craig Laprade, Benjamin Bowman, and H. Howie Huang. *PicoDomain: A Compact High-Fidelity Cybersecurity Dataset*. Available: https://github.com/iHeartGraph/PicoDomain.

2. **LANL Comprehensive Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset from a large production enterprise network with labeled red team data.
   - Citation: A. D. Kent. *Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cybersecurity Events*. Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2015. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.17021/1179829.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
