To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChildCI Framework: Analysis of Motor and Cognitive Development in Children-Computer Interaction for Age Detection" by Juan Carlos Ruiz-Garcia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **ChildCIdb v1 database**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section III (ChildCI Framework)**, where the authors describe the **ChildCIdb v1** in detail. They state that this dataset is composed of 438 children aged from 18 months to 8 years, grouped into different educational levels. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its purpose and the demographic it covers.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset includes various metadata such as previous experience with mobile devices, school grades, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This additional information enhances the dataset's value for future research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ChildCIdb v1** dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset hosted on GitHub, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the **ChildCIdb v1** dataset is:
> Ruiz-Garcia, J.C., Tolosana, R., Vera-Rodriguez, R., Fierrez, J., & Herreros-Rodriguez, J. (2022). *ChildCIdb v1: A dataset for analyzing childrenâ€™s motor and cognitive development through interaction with mobile devices*. Available at: https://github.com/BiDAlab/ChildCIdb v1

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the **ChildCIdb v1** dataset as the primary dataset in this paper, and I have gathered the necessary details and citation for it. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information for future reference or processing.
