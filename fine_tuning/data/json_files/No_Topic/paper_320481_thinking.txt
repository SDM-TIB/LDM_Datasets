To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Morphological Analogies Using Deep Learning – Extended Version" by Safa Alsaidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two primary sources:

1. **Sigmorphon2016 Dataset**: This dataset includes data from multiple languages such as Spanish, German, Finnish, Russian, Turkish, Georgian, Navajo, Arabic (Romanized), Hungarian, and Maltese. The authors specify that they used the data from the inflection subtask of this dataset.

2. **Japanese Bigger Analogy Test Set**: This dataset is specifically mentioned for the Japanese language, indicating that it was used for analogy tasks.

In this section, the authors provide details about the structure of the data, including pairs of words and their morphological transformations, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to obtain full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Sigmorphon2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ryan Cotterell, Christo Kirov, John Sylak-Glassman, David Yarowsky, Jason Eisner, and Mans Hulden. *The Sigmorphon 2016 Shared Task—Morphological Reinflation*. In Proceedings of the ACL, 2016.

- For the **Japanese Bigger Analogy Test Set**, the citation is:
  > Marzena Karpinska, Bofang Li, Anna Rogers, and Aleksandr Drozd. *Subcharacter Information in Japanese Embeddings: When is it Worth It?* In Workshop on the Relevance of Linguistic Structure in Neural Architectures for NLP, pages 28–37, Melbourne, Australia, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
