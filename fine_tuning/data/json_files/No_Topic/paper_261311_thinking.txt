To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Event Salience in Narratives via Barthes’ Cardinal Functions" by Takaki Otake et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses estimating event salience and mentions evaluating methods on folktales with event salience annotation, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, they explicitly mention using the **ProppLearner corpus**, which contains 15 Russian folktales annotated with salient events. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ProppLearner corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **ProppLearner corpus**:
  > Mark A Finlayson. *ProppLearner: Deeply annotating a corpus of Russian folktales to enable the machine learning of a Russian formalist theory*. Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, 32(2):284–300, 2015.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In this case, the authors reference the **ROCStories dataset** in the preliminary experiments section, which is used for assessing the coherence of narratives. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

The citation for the **ROCStories dataset** is:
- For **ROCStories**:
  > Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Nathanael Chambers, Xiaodong He, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, Lucy Vanderwende, Pushmeet Kohli, and James Allen. *A Corpus and Cloze Evaluation for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 839–849, San Diego, California, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **ProppLearner corpus**: A dataset containing 15 Russian folktales annotated with salient events.
   - Citation: Mark A Finlayson. *ProppLearner: Deeply annotating a corpus of Russian folktales to enable the machine learning of a Russian formalist theory*. Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, 32(2):284–300, 2015.

2. **ROCStories**: A dataset designed to capture causal and temporal common sense relations among daily events, used for coherence evaluation.
   - Citation: Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Nathanael Chambers, Xiaodong He, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, Lucy Vanderwende, Pushmeet Kohli, and James Allen. *A Corpus and Cloze Evaluation for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 839–849, San Diego, California, 2016.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
