To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Analysis of Facial Feature Deformation using Optical Flow Algorithm" by Dayang Nur Zulhijah Awang Jesemi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on facial feature deformation related to expressions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Our Work)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. Here, they mention using the **BU3DFE database** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the dataset utilized for their analysis.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the BU3DFE database, including:
- It comprises video data of six basic facial expressions.
- The database contains 90 videos from different subjects, each displaying sequences of facial expressions.
- The videos are in AVI format, with approximately 100 frames per second and a resolution of 640 x 480.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the BU3DFE database. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yin L., Wei X., Sun Y., Wang J., and Rosato M.J. (2006), “A 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research”, 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FGR06), Southampton, 2006, pp. 211-216, doi: 10.1109/FGR.2006.6.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the BU3DFE database.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the BU3DFE database, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
