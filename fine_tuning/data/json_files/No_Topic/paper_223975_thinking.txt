To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Domain-Knowledge-Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Flight Control Design" by Hyo-Sang Shin, Shaoming He, and Antonios Tsourdos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that explicitly mention datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to numerical simulations or empirical studies, as these often involve specific datasets. If the authors mention using standard datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will note these and indicate that further investigation may be needed to find the original sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
