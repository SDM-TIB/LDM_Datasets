To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video-Text Pre-training with Learned Regions" by Rui Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention pre-training on **WebVid2M** and **CC3M** datasets, which indicates that these are significant datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Pre-training Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for pre-training their model. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **WebVid2M**: This dataset contains about 2.5 million image-text pairs harvested from the web, with well-aligned visual and language content.
2. **Google Conceptual Captions (CC3M)**: This dataset consists of approximately 3.3 million image-text pairs, with descriptions derived from HTML attributes associated with images.

Both datasets are crucial for understanding the context of the research and the training process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebVid2M**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Miech, Dimitri Zhukov, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Makarand Tapaswi, Ivan Laptev, and Josef Sivic. *HowTo100M: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2630–2640, 2019.

- For **Google Conceptual Captions (CC3M)**, the citation is:
  > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 2556–2565, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will involve structuring the information clearly for downstream processing or review.
