To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neutron Transmission Strain Tomography for Non-Constant Stress-Free Lattice Spacing" by J.N. Hendriks et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on a simulated dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors describe their method and its validation using simulated datasets. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the use of simulated data for testing their method. They mention that they simulated measurements based on a theoretical strain field and a synthetic stress-free lattice spacing field. I will note the details of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were generated.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. Since the authors refer to previous works and methodologies, I will ensure to capture the full citations for any datasets that are derived from or related to other studies.

Based on my findings, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Simulated Dataset for Strain Field**: This dataset is generated based on a theoretical cantilever beam strain field. The authors provide specific parameters used for the simulation, which I will document.

2. **Synthetic Dataset for Stress-Free Lattice Spacing**: This dataset is defined by a mathematical function with specific parameters. I will include the details of this function and its significance in the context of the study.

Finally, I will ensure that I write the full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper, including those from previous studies that may have influenced the current research.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
