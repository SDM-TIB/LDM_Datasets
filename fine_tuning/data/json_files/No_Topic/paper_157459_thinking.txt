To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Target Recovery for Hindi-English Code Mixed Puns" by Srishti Aggarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing the approach on a "small set of code-mixed punning advertisements," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset they used for testing their model. They mention collecting **518 advertisements released by Amul** over several years, specifically noting that **333 of these were puns, including 121 code-mixed puns**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and the process of annotation.

In this section, the authors explain how they extracted the text of the **121 code-mixed puns** and involved three annotators to identify the pun locations and targets. They also mention that they ended up with **110 annotated puns** after resolving disagreements and removing non-recoverable cases.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the Amul advertisements as a source for their dataset, but they do not provide a formal citation for it. However, I can create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Amul advertisements dataset**, the citation can be structured as follows:
  > Amul. *Amul Hits: A Collection of Advertisements*. Available at: http://www.amul.com/m/amul-hits (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Since the authors do not cite any other datasets, I will conclude that the Amul advertisements dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
