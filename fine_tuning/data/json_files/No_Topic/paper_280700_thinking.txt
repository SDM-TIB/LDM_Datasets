To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design Rule Checking with a CNN Based Feature Extractor" by Luis Francisco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the model was trained with artificial data derived from a set of 50 SRAM designs, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset generation process in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of over 250,000 layout clips created from SRAM layouts using a public design kit. This section provides critical information about the dataset, including its size, composition, and the process used to generate it.

In **subsection 3.1 (Dataset Generation Process)**, the authors outline the steps taken to create the dataset, which includes selecting DRC-free layouts, inserting random DRC violations, and verifying these violations with a conventional DRC checker. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and utility for their experiments.

The authors also mention that the seed for generating the dataset consists of 50 different SRAM designs created by teams in a graduate VLSI class, which is an important detail for citation purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the public design kit used in the dataset generation:

- For the **FreePDK15**, the citation is:
  > Kirti Bhanushali and W. Rhett Davis. 2015. *FreePDK15: An Open-Source Predictive Process Design Kit for 15Nm FinFET Technology*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on International Symposium on Physical Design (Monterey, California, USA) (ISPD ’15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 165–170.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: SRAM Layout Clips Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of over 250,000 layout clips, including both DRC-free layouts and layouts containing random DRC violations. The dataset was generated using 50 different SRAM designs and includes images labeled for DRC violations.
   - **Full Citation**: Kirti Bhanushali and W. Rhett Davis. 2015. *FreePDK15: An Open-Source Predictive Process Design Kit for 15Nm FinFET Technology*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on International Symposium on Physical Design (Monterey, California, USA) (ISPD ’15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 165–170.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
