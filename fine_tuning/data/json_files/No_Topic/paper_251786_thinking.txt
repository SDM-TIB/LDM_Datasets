To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pooling Regularized Graph Neural Network for fMRI Biomarker Analysis" by Xiaoxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method on a **Biopoint Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) fMRI dataset**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They state that they collected fMRI data from **75 ASD children and 43 age and IQ-matched healthy controls**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

In this section, the authors also mention that the fMRI data was acquired under the "biopoint" task, which is relevant for context but does not constitute a dataset name. However, they refer to the dataset as the **Biopoint ASD fMRI dataset**, which I will note down.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the following papers that are relevant to the dataset:

1. For the **Biopoint ASD fMRI dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. D. Kaiser et al., “Neural signatures of autism,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 107, no. 49, pp. 21223–21228, 2010.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset's origin and context.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Identifying the dataset mentioned in the abstract and experiments.
2. Confirming the dataset details in the Data and Preprocessing section.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the References section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Biopoint ASD fMRI dataset, ensuring it is ready for structured output.
