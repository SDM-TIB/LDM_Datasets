To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The CNN-Based Coronary Occlusion Site Localization with Effective Preprocessing Method" by YeongHyeon Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the localization of Coronary Artery Occlusion (CAO) and mentions improving performance through preprocessing methods, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they refer to two datasets: **SNUBH-R** and **SNUBH-BP**. The SNUBH-R dataset contains raw ECG records, while the SNUBH-BP dataset consists of preprocessed ECG data after applying noise reduction and pulse extraction techniques.

I will also check the **tables** presented in the experiments section for additional details about these datasets, such as the number of samples for each class (LAD, LCX, RCA) in both datasets. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a previous work that describes the preprocessing method used, which is essential for understanding the context of the datasets. The relevant citation for the preprocessing method is:

- YeongHyeon Park, Il Dong Yun, and Si-Hyuck Kang. *Preprocessing method for performance enhancement in cnn-based stemi detection from 12-lead ecg*. IEEE Access, 7:99964â€“99977, 2019.

Since the datasets are named after the institution that provided them (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital), I will note that the datasets themselves may not have separate formal citations but are derived from the research conducted at this institution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and the relevant citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise summary of each dataset for future reference or processing.
