To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Determinants of Mode Choice Using Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in the Indian Megacity of Bengaluru" by Tanmay Ghosh and Nithin Nagaraj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilized a dataset of **1350 households** from Bengaluru, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the study area and the dataset used for modeling mode choice. Here, they provide details about the dataset, including the number of households surveyed and the variables included in the dataset. The dataset consists of various attributes such as household vehicle ownership, age of respondents, total household income, travel distance, travel time, and travel cost.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the variables used in the dataset, which include:
- Household vehicle ownership
- Age
- Total household income
- Gender of the respondent
- Travel distance
- Trip time
- Trip cost
- Availability of metro
- Population density
- Employment density

Additionally, **Table 2** presents the class labels and the number of instances for each mode of transportation, which further confirms the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is based on a field survey conducted by the authors themselves, there may not be an external citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and specific to this study.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Bengaluru Mode Choice Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of 1350 households from Bengaluru, containing various attributes related to travel behavior and socio-economic characteristics.
   - **Variables**: Includes household vehicle ownership, age, total household income, gender, travel distance, trip time, trip cost, availability of metro, population density, and employment density.
   - **Citation**: Ghosh, T., & Nagaraj, N. (2023). Evaluating the Determinants of Mode Choice Using Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques in the Indian Megacity of Bengaluru. Preprint.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
