To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curriculum Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation" by Jiwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a curriculum-based training paradigm for the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced. Here, the authors mention the **Touchdown dataset** and the **CVDN dataset**, which are also relevant to the vision-and-language navigation tasks.

I will then look into the **curriculum design** section, where the authors discuss the R2R dataset in detail and introduce a rearranged version called the **CLR2R dataset**. This dataset is specifically designed for curriculum learning and is derived from the original R2R dataset.

In the **experiments** section, the authors confirm that they utilize both the R2R and CLR2R datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **references section**:

1. **Room-to-Room (R2R) Dataset**:

In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3674–3683.

2. **Touchdown Dataset**:
   > Chen, H., Suhr, A., Misra, D. K., Snavely, N., & Artzi, Y. (2019). Touchdown: Natural Language Navigation and Spatial Reasoning in Visual Street Environments. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 12530–12539.

3. **CVDN Dataset**:
   > Thomason, J., Murray, M., Cakmak, M., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2019). Vision-and-Dialog Navigation. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

4. **CLR2R Dataset**: This dataset is a rearranged version of the R2R dataset specifically for curriculum learning, so I will cite it as a derivative of the R2R dataset:
   > Zhang, J., Wei, Z., Fan, J., & Peng, J. (2021). Curriculum Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation. In Proceedings of the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

Now that I have identified and cited the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
