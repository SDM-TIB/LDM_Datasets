To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using The Interactive Graphic Syllabus In The Teaching Of Economics" by Seyyed Ali Zeytoon Nejad Moosavian, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to identify any references to datasets or resources that could be considered datasets. The abstract mentions the concept of an "Interactive Graphic Syllabus" and its application in economics, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **literature review and methodology sections** to see if the author discusses any specific datasets used in their research or examples. In this paper, the author refers to a visual "big picture" of intermediate macroeconomics proposed by Moosavian (2016a), which may imply the use of data or diagrams but does not specify datasets.

I will also check the **appendices** for any supplementary materials that might include datasets or references to datasets. The appendices contain diagrams and models related to macroeconomics but do not explicitly list datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will look for any references to external resources or datasets that the author might have used. The references section includes citations of other works by Moosavian and related literature, but again, there are no explicit datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the relevant citations from the references section that could be associated with the datasets or resources discussed in the paper. The citations include:

1. Moosavian, S. A. Z. N. (2016a). Teaching Economics and Providing Visual “Big Pictures”. *Journal of Economics and Political Economy*, 3(1), 119-133. http://dx.doi.org/10.1453/jepe.v3i1.631

2. Abel, A. B., Bernanke, B. S., & Croushore, D. (2008). *Macroeconomics* (6th edn). Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.

3. Nilson, L. B. (2009). *The Graphic Syllabus and the outcomes map: Communicating your course* (Vol. 137). John Wiley & Sons.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that while the author discusses the concept of an Interactive Graphic Syllabus and its application in economics, there are no specific datasets provided in this paper. 

In summary, I will document the citations related to the visual "big picture" and the resources mentioned, but I will conclude that no specific datasets were extracted from this paper.
