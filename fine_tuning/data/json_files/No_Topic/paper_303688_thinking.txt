To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUBO transformation using Eigenvalue Decomposition" by Amit Verma and Mark Lewis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and computational experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "computational results on benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Computational Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two specific datasets:

1. **ORLIB datasets**: This dataset is described as containing instances with 100, 250, 500, and 1000 nodes, with integral coefficients randomly chosen from a uniform distribution. The authors note that these datasets are sparse with linear and quadratic densities of 10%.

2. **Palubeckis datasets**: This dataset is characterized as containing larger and denser datasets with 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, and 7000 nodes, with densities ranging from 10% to 100%.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **ORLIB datasets**, the citation is:
  > Beasley, J.E. (1990). *OR-library: distributing test problems by electronic mail*. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 41(11), 1069–1072.

- For the **Palubeckis datasets**, the citation is:
  > Palubeckis, G. (2004). *Multistart tabu search strategies for the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem*. Annals of Operations Research, 131(1), 259–282.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
