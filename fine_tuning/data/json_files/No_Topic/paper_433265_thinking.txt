To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brain Storm Optimization Based Swarm Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Image Classification" by Liang Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used. I will look for the name of this dataset in these sections.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention conducting experiments on a "real-world Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) dataset" and provide a link to the dataset on Kaggle. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

In this section, they describe the dataset as consisting of a large collection of retina images taken using fundus photography, classified into five grades based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy. This description provides essential details about the dataset's content and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset:
  > Kaggle. *APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data.

This citation is crucial as it provides the source and context for the dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation, which is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
