To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Dimensional Data Enrichment: Interpretable, Fast, and Data-Efficient" by Amir Asiaee T. et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)** dataset, which is used for analyzing drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines. They describe it as a compilation of approximately 500 human cancer cell lines with responses to 24 anticancer drugs measured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CCLE dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jordi Barretina, Giordano Caponigro, Nicolas Stransky, Kavitha Venkatesan, Adam A Margolin, Sungjoon Kim, Christopher J Wilson, Joseph Leh√°r, Gregory V Kryukov, Dmitriy Sonkin, et al. *The cancer cell line encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity*. Nature, 483(7391):603, 2012.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)**: A dataset containing approximately 500 human cancer cell lines with measured responses to 24 anticancer drugs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
