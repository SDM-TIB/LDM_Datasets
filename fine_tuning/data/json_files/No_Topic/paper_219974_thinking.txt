To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Allocation and Pricing: Constant Regret via Bellman Inequalities" by Alberto Vera, Siddhartha Banerjee, and Itai Gurvich, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors often describe the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for testing their algorithms. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that provide context about the datasets.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings of the research. This section may include performance metrics that are tied to specific datasets, which can help confirm their relevance.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, number of samples, and any relevant features.
3. **Citation**: The full citation of the original source of the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
