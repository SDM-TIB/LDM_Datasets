To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Highly Configurable Hardware/Software Stack for DNN Inference Acceleration" by Suvadeep Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any references to datasets that the authors may have used to benchmark their methods. This section typically outlines the context and motivation for the research, which may include specific datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, as it often details the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the models. If the authors describe their experiments, they may explicitly name the datasets and provide details about their characteristics.

Following that, I will look into the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized and their significance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset, as these will be necessary for proper attribution.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including its name, purpose, and any relevant characteristics. I will also ensure to include the full citation for each dataset as found in the references.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
