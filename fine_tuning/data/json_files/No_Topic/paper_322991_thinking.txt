To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence for Unimodal Bandits" by Hassan Saber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions "numerical experiments," which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific mentions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors compare their algorithm (IMED-UB) with other algorithms (OSUB, UTS) under different distribution assumptions (Bernoulli, Gaussian, Exponential). However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets by name.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather discusses the performance of the algorithm under various distributions, I will look for any references to datasets in the **references section**. I will note any datasets that are commonly used in the context of multi-armed bandit problems or that are referenced in the cited works.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers in the field, but they do not provide specific datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that while the paper discusses numerical experiments, it does not provide explicit datasets or their citations.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The experiments were conducted using synthetic data under various distribution assumptions (Bernoulli, Gaussian, Exponential).**
3. **No full citations for datasets can be provided as none were explicitly referenced.**

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched for datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when available. Since no datasets were found, I will note that in my final output.
