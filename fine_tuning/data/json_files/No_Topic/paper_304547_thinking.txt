To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Modern Perspective on Query Likelihood with Deep Generative Retrieval Models" by Oleg Lesota et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking** and **TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking** collections. This suggests that these collections are datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking**: This dataset consists of 8,841,822 documents and 55,578 queries, which are used for passage retrieval tasks.

2. **TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking**: This dataset is derived from the MS MARCO collection and contains 43 annotated queries, specifically designed for evaluating passage retrieval models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

- For **TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820, 2020.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
