To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNS) in Image Classification" by Meghashrita Das and Tirupati Bolisetti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental settings, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with **MNIST digit recognition** and **crack image classification datasets**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains 200 images from the training sample, specifically handwritten digits 0 and 1. This is a well-known dataset in the field of image classification.

2. **Crack Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of various concrete surfaces labeled as either negative (no cracks) or positive (cracks present), with each class containing 1,000 images, totaling 2,000 images.

I will also verify if there are any additional details or references to these datasets in the **results section**. The results confirm that both datasets were used for training and evaluation of the proposed VQNN algorithm.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized, and its citation is:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The crack detection dataset is mentioned as a Kaggle dataset, but the specific citation is not provided in the paper. I will note that it is a Kaggle dataset, and I will provide a general citation format for Kaggle datasets:

- For **Crack Detection Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Crack Detection Dataset*. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (specific URL to be determined based on the dataset used).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
