To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Listing Prices in Dynamic Short Term Rental Markets Using Machine Learning Models" by Sam Chapman, Seifey Mohammad, and Kimberly Villegas, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the research focuses on predicting Airbnb rental prices, which suggests that datasets related to Airbnb listings are likely to be included. The introduction further emphasizes the dynamic nature of Airbnb pricing and the importance of historical data, hinting at the presence of datasets that capture this information.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data Description)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. This section is crucial as it may explicitly list the datasets and provide descriptions of their contents. 

In **subsection 3.1 (Listings)**, the authors mention that the listings dataset is sourced from Inside Airbnb, containing 14,368 rows and 74 columns, which includes descriptive information about Airbnb listings in Austin, Texas. This dataset is essential for understanding the features that influence pricing.

In **subsection 3.2 (Calendar)**, the authors describe a calendar dataset sourced from GitHub and Kaggle, which contains pricing information over time for the listings. This dataset is crucial for capturing the temporal dynamics of pricing.

In **subsection 3.3 (Reviews)**, the authors mention a reviews dataset sourced from Inside Airbnb, which contains 944,636 rows and includes user feedback on the listings. This dataset is important for sentiment analysis and understanding guest experiences.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will need to gather are:
1. For the **Listings dataset** from Inside Airbnb:
   > Inside Airbnb. *Inside Airbnb*, http://insideairbnb.com/.

2. For the **Calendar dataset** sourced from GitHub and Kaggle:
   > Kilari, Sai Ram. “Austin Airbnb Dataset.” Kaggle, 24 Mar. 2023, www.kaggle.com/datasets/sairamkilari/austin-airbnb-dataset.

3. For the **Reviews dataset** from Inside Airbnb:
   > Inside Airbnb. *Inside Airbnb*, http://insideairbnb.com/.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
