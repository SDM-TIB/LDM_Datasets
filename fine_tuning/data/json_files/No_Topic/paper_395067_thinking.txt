To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prototypes-oriented Transductive Few-shot Learning with Conditional Transport" by Long Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "four standard benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset is described as containing 100 classes with 600 images per class, randomly chosen from the ILSVRC-12 dataset. The resolution of the images is 84 × 84 × 3.

2. **tieredImageNet**: This dataset is a larger subset of ILSVRC-12, containing 608 classes sampled from a hierarchical structure, with around 1281 images per class, also at a resolution of 84 × 84 × 3.

3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: This fine-grained dataset consists of 200 classes of birds, with around 60 images per class, maintaining the same resolution of 84 × 84 × 3.

4. **CIFAR-FS**: This dataset consists of all 100 classes from CIFAR-100, split into 64 base classes, 16 validation classes, and 20 novel classes, with each image sized at 32 × 32 × 3.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **CUB**, the citation is:

  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P. H. S., & Vedaldi, A. *Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08136, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
