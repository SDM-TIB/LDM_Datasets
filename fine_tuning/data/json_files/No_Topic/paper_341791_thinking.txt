To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The ACM Multimedia 2022 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge: Vocalisations, Stuttering, Activity, & Mosquitoes" by Björn W. Schuller et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses four sub-challenges, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for each sub-challenge. They describe the datasets for the Vocalisations, Stuttering, Activity, and Mosquitoes sub-challenges, providing key details about each.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide more detailed descriptions of each dataset. In this case, the paper has a section titled "THE FOUR SUB-CHALLENGES," which outlines the specifics of each dataset:

1. **Vocalisations Corpus (VOC-C)**: This dataset is derived from the Variably Intense Vocalizations of Affect and Emotion Corpus (VIVAE) and is used for classifying non-verbal vocal expressions. The authors mention the number of samples and the emotional classes involved.

2. **Kassel State of Fluency Corpus (KSF-C)**: This dataset is used for the Stuttering Sub-Challenge and contains segments from German speakers annotated for various stuttering-related classes.

3. **Human Activity Recognition Corpus (HAR-C)**: This dataset is collected from smartwatch sensors and includes measurements from participants performing various activities.

4. **Mosquito Corpus (MOS-C)**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of mosquito flights and is used for detecting mosquito events.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Vocalisations Corpus (VOC-C)**, the citation is:
  > Natalie Holz, Pauline Larrouy-Maestri, and David Poeppel. 2022. The Variably Intense Vocalizations of Affect and Emotion (VIVAE) Corpus prompts new perspective on nonspeech perception. *Emotion* 22, 1 (2022), 213–225.

- For the **Kassel State of Fluency Corpus (KSF-C)**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian P. Bayerl, Alexander Wolff von Gudenberg, Florian Hönig, Elmar Nöth, and Korbinian Riedhammer. 2022. KSoF: The Kassel State of Fluency Dataset - A Therapy Centered Dataset of Stuttering. In *Proc. LREC*. Marseille, France.

- For the **Human Activity Recognition Corpus (HAR-C)**, the citation is:
  > A. Mallol-Ragolta, A. Semertzidou, M. Pateraki, and B. Schuller. 2021. harAGE: A Novel Multimodal Smartwatch-based Dataset for Human Activity Recognition. In *Proc. FG*. IEEE, Jodhpur, India – Virtual Event.

- For the **Mosquito Corpus (MOS-C)**, the citation is:
  > I. Kiskin, M. Sinka, A.D. Cobb, W. Rafique, L. Wang, D. Zilli, B. Gutteridge, R. Dam, T. Marinos, Y. Li, and D. Msaky. 2021. HumBugDB: A Large-scale Acoustic Mosquito Dataset. In *Proc. NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks*. New Orleans, USA.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
