To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ANALYSIS VS SYNTHESIS - AN INVESTIGATION OF (CO)SPARSE SIGNAL MODELS ON GRAPHS" by Madeleine S. Kotzagiannidis and Mike E. Davies, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a theoretical overview, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** where the authors might describe their methods or experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for a theoretical foundation in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and analysis sections** to see if any datasets are referenced.

In **section 4 (Analysis vs Synthesis Signal Models)**, the authors describe theoretical models and properties but do not provide empirical data or datasets. I will check if there are any **case studies or examples** later in the paper that might involve datasets.

In **section 5 (Co)sparsity on Circulant Graphs**, the authors discuss properties of circulant graphs and their implications but again do not mention specific datasets. 

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets or if the authors refer to datasets used in previous studies. However, it appears that this paper is primarily theoretical and does not utilize specific datasets for empirical validation.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to note their names, descriptions, and full citations as per the guidelines. However, in this case, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries.
