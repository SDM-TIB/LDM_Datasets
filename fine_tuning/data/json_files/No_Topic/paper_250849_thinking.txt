To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A curated collection of COVID-19 online datasets" by Isa Inuwa-Dutse and Ioannis Korkontzelos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper provides a collection of curated datasets related to COVID-19, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Curated Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. This section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their sources and descriptions. 

In **subsection 2.1 (Tweet-based collection)**, the authors outline three categories of Twitter data:
1. **Account-based collection**: Tweets from specific monitored accounts related to COVID-19.
2. **Random collection**: A generic collection of tweets related to the pandemic.
3. **Miscellaneous collection**: Tweets that include misinformation and myths about COVID-19.

In **subsection 2.2 (Non-tweet collection)**, the authors mention datasets from credible sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the UK’s National Health Service (NHS-UK), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC-NG), and the USA’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-USA). 

I will then compile the details of each dataset, including their descriptions and the sources from which they were derived. 

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:
- For the **Twitter datasets**, I will cite the relevant papers that describe the datasets, such as those mentioned in the related work section.
- For the **WHO and other health organization datasets**, I will ensure to cite the original sources or reports from which the data was derived.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description, the source, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets for future reference and research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
