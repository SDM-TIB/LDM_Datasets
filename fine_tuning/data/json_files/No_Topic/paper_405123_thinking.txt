To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond VaR and CVaR: Topological Risk Measures in Financial Markets" by Amit Kumar Jha, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and methodology sections** to find any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses "last one year daily real-world closing price return data for three equities: Apple, Microsoft, and Google." This suggests that there are specific datasets related to these equities.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Methodology)**, where the author provides a detailed description of the dataset. The paper states that the dataset consists of one-year historical daily closing prices for three major technology stocks: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). Each dataset contains 252 observations corresponding to the trading days within that year.

In this section, the author also mentions that the data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the data source. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Yahoo Finance data, but I can formulate a general citation based on standard practices for citing data sources. 

The citation for the datasets can be structured as follows:

- For **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**, **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**, and **Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Data for Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The datasets are:

1. **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**: Historical daily closing prices for one year.
2. **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**: Historical daily closing prices for one year.
3. **Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)**: Historical daily closing prices for one year.

Each dataset will reference the Yahoo Finance source for proper citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
