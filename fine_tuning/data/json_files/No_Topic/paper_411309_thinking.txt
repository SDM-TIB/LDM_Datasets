To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exponentially Convergent Algorithms for Supervised Matrix Factorization" by Joowon Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of their algorithm to **microarray datasets for cancer classification**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They specifically mention using two datasets from the **Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa)** for their analysis. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details about the datasets:

1. **Pancreatic Cancer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 54,676 gene expressions from 51 subjects, with binary labels indicating the presence of pancreatic cancer.

2. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: This dataset contains 35,982 gene expressions from 289 subjects, also with binary labels indicating breast cancer.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the **Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa)**, which is the source of the datasets. The citation for CuMiDa is:

- **CuMiDa**: 
  > Bruno César Feltes, Eduardo Bassani Chandelier, Bruno Iochins Grisci, and Márcio Dorn. *Cumida: An extensively curated microarray database for benchmarking and testing of machine learning approaches in cancer research*. Journal of Computational Biology, 26(4):376–386, 2019. PMID: 30789283.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **Pancreatic Cancer Dataset**: 
   - Description: 54,676 gene expressions from 51 subjects with binary labels indicating pancreatic cancer.
   - Citation: Feltes et al. (2019).

2. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: 
   - Description: 35,982 gene expressions from 289 subjects with binary labels indicating breast cancer.
   - Citation: Feltes et al. (2019).

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
