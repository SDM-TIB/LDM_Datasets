To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Face, Body, Voice: Video Person-Clustering with Multiple Modalities" by Andrew Brown et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce a new dataset for evaluating multi-modal person-clustering, which suggests that a specific dataset is being highlighted.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their research. In this case, I will focus on **section 4 (Video Person-Clustering Dataset)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD)**, which is the primary dataset introduced in this paper. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of body-tracks, face-tracks, and voice-tracks, as well as the diversity of the program sets included.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several existing datasets that were repurposed for their study, including:

1. **TBBT (The Big Bang Theory)**: 
   > Anindya Roy, Camille Guinaudeau, Hervé Bredin, and Claude Barras. *TVD: A reproducible and multiply aligned TV series dataset*. In LREC, 2014.

2. **Buﬀy**: 
   > Mark Everingham, Josef Sivic, and Andrew Zisserman. *“Hello! My name is... Buﬀy” – automatic naming of characters in TV video*. In Proc. BMVC, 2006.

3. **Sherlock**: 
   > Arsha Nagrani and Andrew Zisserman. *From benedict cumberbatch to sherlock holmes: Character identification in tv series without a script*. In Proc. BMVC, 2017.

4. **Friends**: 
   > Vicky Kalogeiton and Andrew Zisserman. *Constrained video face clustering using 1nn relations*. In Proc. BMVC, 2020.

5. **ALN (About Last Night)**: 
   > Not explicitly cited in the provided text, but should be referenced in the full paper.

6. **HF (Hidden Figures)**: 
   > Not explicitly cited in the provided text, but should be referenced in the full paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as mentioned in the references section. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
