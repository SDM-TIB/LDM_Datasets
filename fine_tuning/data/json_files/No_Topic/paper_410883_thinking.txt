To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed AI in Zero-touch Provisioning for Edge Networks" by Abhishek Hazra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specifics.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** (if available) to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for their experiments. This is often where datasets are explicitly named, along with their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

I will also check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as datasets may be summarized or referenced visually. If there are any tables that list datasets or their attributes, I will take note of them.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **data sources**. In this paper, there may not be a clearly defined section, but I will keep an eye out for any mentions of datasets in the context of Distributed AI or Zero-touch Provisioning.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I may need to conduct a brief literature search to find the original sources of the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurate and complete. This will allow me to present the datasets in a clear and organized manner for future reference or analysis.
