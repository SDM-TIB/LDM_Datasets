To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Tissue Scanning Under Free-Form Motion for Intraoperative Tissue Characterisation" by Jian Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of tissue scanning in minimally invasive surgery but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their framework and experimental setup.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors mention using a **silicon liver phantom** for validation. This phantom is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a physical model used for experiments. I will note this as it may be relevant for understanding the context of the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results** section. Here, the authors detail their experiments, including the use of **three periodic respiratory motions** (Proﬁle 1, Proﬁle 2, and Proﬁle 3) to test the framework. However, these profiles are not datasets but rather conditions under which the experiments were conducted.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references primarily consist of studies related to robotic surgery and imaging techniques, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets that were used in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided or cited in the research. The authors primarily rely on a phantom model for their experiments and do not reference any publicly available datasets.

Since I have not identified any datasets to document, I will conclude that this paper does not contribute any datasets for citation. However, I will summarize the key points regarding the experimental setup and the use of the silicon liver phantom for clarity.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and experimental setups, it does not provide or reference any datasets that can be cited in a formal manner.
