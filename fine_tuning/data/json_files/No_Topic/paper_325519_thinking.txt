To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SurfGen: Adversarial 3D Shape Synthesis with Explicit Surface Discriminators" by Andrew Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the model on large-scale shape datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.2, the authors mention that they trained their models on three categories from **ShapeNet.v2**: airplane, car, and chair. This indicates that **ShapeNet** is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **methodology sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be **ShapeNet**, as it is referenced multiple times throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for **ShapeNet**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Since **ShapeNet** is the only dataset explicitly mentioned, I will compile this information into a structured format.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focused on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Checked the references for full citations of the identified datasets.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for **ShapeNet** with its full citation.
