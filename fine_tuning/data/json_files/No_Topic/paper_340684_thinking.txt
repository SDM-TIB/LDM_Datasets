To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GeoTyper: Automated Pipeline from Raw scRNA-Seq Data to Cell Type Identification" by Cecily Wolfe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets that the authors have utilized.

Next, I will examine **section III (Data Description)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used to develop and validate their pipeline. They refer to two datasets containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and samples from patients with lung cancer, which are crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **PBMC Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a healthy donor and is available from 10X Genomics. It is noted that this dataset contains peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are essential for immune cell studies.

2. **Lung Cancer Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples from several patients with lung cancer, also sourced from 10X Genomics. It is important for analyzing the tumor microenvironment and immune responses.

Additionally, the authors mention a dataset from **Cerapio et al.** that includes data from three patients with lymphoma, which is also relevant for their analysis.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **PBMC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 10X Genomics. “1k PBMCs from a healthy donor, v3 chemistry.” [Online]. Available: https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/1-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-v-3-chemistry-3-standard-3-0-0. [Accessed: 30-Mar-2022].

- For the **Lung Cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Discovery Life Sciences. “20k Mixture of NSCLC DTCs from 7 donors, 3’ v3.1 (without intronic reads).” [Online]. Available: https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/20-k-mixture-of-nsclc-dt-cs-from-7-donors-3-v-3-1-3-1-standard-6-1-0. [Accessed: 30-Mar-2022].

- For the **Lymphoma Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J.-P. Cerapio et al. “Phased differentiation of γδ T and T CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed by single-cell transcriptomics of human cancers.” OncoImmunology, vol. 10, no. 1, Sep. 2021. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2021.1939518.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
