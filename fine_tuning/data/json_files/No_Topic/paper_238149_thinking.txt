To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unity Style Transfer for Person Re-Identification" by Chong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 labeled images from 6 camera angles, with 1501 identities. It is divided into three parts: 751 individuals for training (12,936 images), 750 individuals for testing (19,732 images), and 3,368 images for querying.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset consists of 36,411 labeled images from 8 camera views, with 1404 identities. Similar to Market-1501, it is divided into three parts: 702 individuals for training (16,522 images), 702 individuals for testing (17,661 images), and 2,228 images for querying.

To confirm the details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark. In ICCV.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). Performance evaluation of multi-target tracking methods. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
