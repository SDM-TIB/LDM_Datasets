To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Diversify for Single Domain Generalization" by Zijian Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Digits Dataset**: This dataset consists of five different datasets, which are MNIST, SVHN, MNIST-M, SYN, and USPS. Each dataset represents a unique domain with variations in font style, background, and stroke color.

2. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset is a benchmark for domain generalization that includes four domains: photo, art painting, cartoon, and sketch. It contains a total of 9,991 images across seven categories.

3. **Corrupted CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset includes 32x32 RGB images from CIFAR-10 that have been corrupted by various types of noise, with 15 corruptions across four main categories: weather, blur, noise, and digital.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

- For **MNIST-M**, the citation is:
  > Ganin, Y., & Lempitsky, V. S. *Unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation*. In ICML, 2015.

- For **SYN**, the citation is:
  > Ganin, Y., & Lempitsky, V. S. *Unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation*. In ICML, 2015.

- For **USPS**, the citation is:
  > Denker, J. S., Gardner, W. R., Graf, H. P., Henderson, D., Howard, R. E., Hubbard, W. E., Jackel, L. D., Baird, H. S., & Guyon, I. *Neural network recognizer for hand-written zip code digits*. In NeurIPS, 1988.

- For **PACS**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Yang, Y., Song, Y. Z., & Hospedales, T. M. *Deeper, broader and artier domain generalization*. In ICCV, 2017.

- For **Corrupted CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. ICLR, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
