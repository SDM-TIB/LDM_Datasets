To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFORM: Diffeomorphic vector field alignment for assessing dynamics across learned models" by Ruiqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the DFORM framework and its application to models trained on a canonical neuroscience task, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that might explicitly mention datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on."

In the **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared using the DFORM framework. If the authors mention specific datasets or provide details about the data used in their experiments, I will note those down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citation information.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "Van der Pol oscillator" or "RNNs," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted datasets and their citations in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
