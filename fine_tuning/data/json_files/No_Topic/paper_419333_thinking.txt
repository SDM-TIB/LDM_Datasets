To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3-D Position Optimization of Solar-Powered Hovering UAV Relay in Optical Wireless Backhaul" by Heyou Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of a solar-powered UAV relay and mentions various atmospheric conditions but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** for any references to datasets used in the study. I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the use of specific datasets. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **results section**, if the authors present experimental results, I will check if they reference any datasets used for validation or testing. I will also look for any tables that summarize data or results, as these may indicate the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider whether the authors refer to any publicly available datasets or benchmarks in the context of their research. In such cases, I will document these references as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
