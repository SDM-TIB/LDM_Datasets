To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How far did we get in face spooﬁng detection?" by Luiz Souza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on face spooﬁng detection and hints at the use of public datasets for comparative analysis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **Table 2** that summarizes the available face spooﬁng datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process.

In **Table 2**, the paper lists several datasets along with their characteristics, such as the year of release, number of subjects, number of real/fake samples, and types of attacks. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **NUAA Photograph Imposter Dataset**: Released in 2010, it contains 15 subjects with 5,105 real and 7,509 fake samples. The type of attack is a flat printed photo.
   
2. **Yale Recaptured Dataset**: Released in 2011, it has 10 subjects with 200 real and 200 fake samples, also involving flat printed photos.

3. **Replay-Attack Dataset**: Released in 2012, it includes 1,300 video clips of photo and video attacks.

4. **Print-Attack Dataset**: Released in 2012, it has 50 subjects with 150 real and 450 fake samples, focusing on flat printed photos.

5. **Casia Face Anti-Spooﬁng Dataset**: Released in 2012, it contains various attack types, including warped photos and video playback.

6. **Kose and Dugelay Dataset**: Released in 2013, it includes 50 subjects with 200 real and 198 fake samples, focusing on mask attacks.

7. **3D Mask Attack Dataset**: Released in 2013, it consists of video sequences recorded with an RGB-D camera.

8. **MSU Mobile Face Spooﬁng Dataset**: Released in 2014, it has 280 video clips of print photo and video attack attempts.

9. **Unicamp Video-Attack Dataset (UVAD)**: Released in 2015, it includes videos of valid accesses and attacks of 404 subjects.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **NUAA Photograph Imposter Dataset** is:
> Tan, X., Li, Y., Liu, J., & Jiang, L. (2010). Face liveness detection from a single image with sparse low rank bilinear discriminative model. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 504-517.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
