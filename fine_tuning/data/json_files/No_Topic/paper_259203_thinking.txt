To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RobustBench: a standardized adversarial robustness benchmark" by Francesco Croce et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a "standardized benchmark of adversarial robustness" and refers to a leaderboard containing evaluations of "120+ models," which suggests that datasets are involved in these evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **methodology**, the authors describe their evaluation process and mention using datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** for benchmarking adversarial robustness. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments** section, I will check for detailed descriptions of how these datasets are used. The authors provide insights into the evaluation metrics and the specific tasks performed on these datasets, confirming their relevance.

I will also examine the **results** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any specific splits or subsets of the datasets used in their evaluations.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Based on my findings, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Citation: 
     > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
   - Citation: 
     > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification with over 14 million images across 20,000 categories.
   - Citation: 
     > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future use or verification.
