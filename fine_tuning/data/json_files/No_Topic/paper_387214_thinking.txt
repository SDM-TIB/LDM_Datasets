To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Estimate Model Transferability of Pre-Trained Speech Models?" by Zih-Ching Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating popular supervised and self-supervised speech models using public data, which suggests that specific datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 3.1 (Experimental setup)**, they mention using the **Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)** benchmark for continuous automatic speech recognition (ASR) adaptation. This indicates that MLS is a dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, in **section 3.1**, they refer to the **LibriSpeech dataset**, specifically the train-clean-100, dev-clean, and test-clean subsets, for phoneme and isolated word recognition tasks. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Furthermore, in **section 3.3.1**, the authors mention evaluating six different pre-trained models on the **GSC-v1** dataset for classification tasks. This dataset is also relevant for extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

1. For the **Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)** dataset, the citation is:
   > V. Pratap, Q. Xu et al., “MLS: A large-scale multilingual dataset for speech research,” Proc. of Interspeech, pp. 2757–2761, 2020.

2. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen et al., “Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in Proc. of ICASSP, pp. 5206–5210, 2015.

3. For the **GSC-v1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > P. Warden, “Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition,” arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and completely. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
