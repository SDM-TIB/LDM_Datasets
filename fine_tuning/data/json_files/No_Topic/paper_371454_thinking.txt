To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Optimization Approach Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficiency in Heterogeneous Computing System" by Zheqi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may mention prior work or datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and any datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

I will also check the **experimental evaluation section** for any additional information regarding datasets used in the experiments. This section often contains results and comparisons that may reference specific datasets.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "YOLOv4" in the context of its experiments, I would look for the original paper that describes this dataset to provide a complete citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and properly referenced.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing.
