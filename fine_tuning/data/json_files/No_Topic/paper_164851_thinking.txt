To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining Sub-Interval Relationships In Time Series Data" by Saurabh Agrawal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their approach on two real-world datasets from climate science and neuroscience, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5.1 (Data and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Global Sea Level Pressure (SLP) Data**: This dataset is provided by the NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis Project and spans from 1979 to 2014, consisting of monthly data at a spatial resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 degrees. The authors explain that they generated representative time series for 10,512 regions based on strong correlations among locations.

2. **Brain fMRI Data**: This dataset was collected from a study involving 50 subjects who viewed video clips while undergoing fMRI scans. The temporal resolution is two seconds, resulting in a time series of 240 observations for each of the 90 anatomical regions of the brain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Global Sea Level Pressure (SLP) Data**, the citation is:
  > R. Kistler, W. Collins et al. "The NCEP-NCAR 50-year reanalysis: Monthly means CD-ROM and documentation." *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*, 2001.

- For the **Brain fMRI Data**, the citation is:
  > I. S. Ramsay, M. C. Yzer et al. "Affective and executive network processing associated with persuasive anti-drug messages." *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 2013.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Global Sea Level Pressure (SLP) Data**: A dataset provided by the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project, covering 36 years of monthly data at a spatial resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 degrees, resulting in 10,512 time series for various regions.
   - Citation: R. Kistler, W. Collins et al. "The NCEP-NCAR 50-year reanalysis: Monthly means CD-ROM and documentation." *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*, 2001.

2. **Brain fMRI Data**: Collected from 50 subjects during a study where participants viewed video clips, resulting in a time series of 240 observations for 90 anatomical regions of the brain.
   - Citation: I. S. Ramsay, M. C. Yzer et al. "Affective and executive network processing associated with persuasive anti-drug messages." *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 2013.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
