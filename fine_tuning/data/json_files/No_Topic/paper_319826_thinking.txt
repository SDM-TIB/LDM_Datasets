To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Antenna De-Embedding in FDTD Using Spherical Wave Functions by Exploiting Orthogonality" by Leonardo Mörlein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of antenna de-embedding in wireless body area networks but do not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to the **validation section** where the authors describe their experimental setup and results. This section is likely to contain references to datasets used for validation purposes.

In the **validation section**, the authors mention the use of a dual-mode wristband antenna and describe the simulation scenarios. They refer to the collection of electromagnetic field values from FDTD simulations, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. However, they do mention that the results are validated against direct simulations, which suggests that there are datasets involved in the validation process.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to the study. The authors reference several papers, including works by Naganawa et al. that discuss antenna de-embedding and may provide datasets used in their experiments.

The references that may contain relevant datasets include:

1. **Naganawa et al. (2015)**: 
   > J. Naganawa, K. Haneda, M. Kim, T. Aoyagi, and J. Takada, “Antenna de-embedding in FDTD-based radio propagation prediction by using spherical wave function,” IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. 63, no. 6, pp. 2545–2557, June 2015.

2. **Naganawa et al. (2017)**: 
   > J. Naganawa, J. Takada, T. Aoyagi, and M. Kim, “Antenna de-embedding in WBAN channel modeling using spherical wave functions,” IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. 65, no. 3, pp. 1289–1300, March 2017.

These references may provide datasets or methodologies that can be used to replicate the experiments described in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets:

- The paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, but it discusses the use of FDTD simulations and validation against direct simulation results.
- The references to Naganawa et al. may lead to datasets relevant to antenna de-embedding and FDTD simulations.

Finally, I will compile the citations for the referenced works that may contain datasets into a structured format for documentation purposes.

After this analysis, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the findings and citations identified in the paper.
