To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaffold-constrained molecular generation" by Maxime Langevin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for training or validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section may include details about how the datasets were curated, any preprocessing steps taken, and the specific characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of specific datasets such as:

1. **ChEMBL Dataset**: The authors mention using a preprocessed version of the ChEMBL database, specifically filtered for drug-like molecules. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the filtering criteria and the link to access it.

2. **SureChEMBL Dataset**: The paper discusses the extraction of compounds from the SureChEMBL database, which is used as a validation set. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including the number of compounds and the link for access.

3. **DRD2 Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset used for benchmarking their method against the DRD2 target. I will ensure to capture the citation and access link for this dataset.

4. **MMP-12 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of lead optimization and is sourced from supplementary materials of another paper. I will extract the citation and access link for this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the means to access the original sources.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **ChEMBL dataset**, I will find the original reference that describes the database and its usage in drug discovery.
- For the **SureChEMBL dataset**, I will locate the citation that details its creation and significance in the context of patented compounds.
- For the **DRD2 dataset**, I will find the reference that discusses its use in the context of activity prediction.
- For the **MMP-12 dataset**, I will identify the original source from which this dataset was derived.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
