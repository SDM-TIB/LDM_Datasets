To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Motion Trajectory Prediction: A Survey" by Andrey Rudenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that might include datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **section 7 (Motion Prediction Evaluation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation purposes. I will read through this section carefully to identify any datasets listed, along with their descriptions, such as the number of agents, types of sensors used, and the context of the scenes.

In the **tables provided in the paper**, particularly Table 2 and Table 3, I will look for structured information about datasets. These tables typically summarize key characteristics of each dataset, including the location, types of agents, sensors used, and any relevant annotations. I will ensure to note down the details for each dataset mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete reference for future readers. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe each dataset in detail.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly to ensure that each dataset is well-documented and easily accessible for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining accuracy and completeness in the citations.
