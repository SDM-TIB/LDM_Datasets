To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rank Persistence: Assessing the Temporal Performance of Real-World Person Re-Identification" by Srikrishna Karanam, Eric Lam, and Richard J. Radke, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new long-term dataset with multiple candidate reappearances, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Preliminaries)**, where the authors describe the dataset they collected. They mention that the dataset consists of 10 hours of surveillance video data from a light rail station in the United States, involving 7 known actors who reappear in different sessions. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of actors, the nature of their appearances, and the total duration of the video.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a statistical summary of the dataset, which includes:
- Total number of bounding boxes: 4,639
- Number of known actors: 7
- Number of known actor reappearances: 3
- Total number of candidates (including actors): 535
- Total video hours: 10

This information confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly collected and not a previously published one, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Long-term Person Re-Identification Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 10 hours of surveillance video data collected at a light rail station, featuring 7 known actors who reappear in different sessions with varying appearances.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper, it does not have a separate citation. The authors should be referenced for the dataset description.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Srikrishna Karanam, Eric Lam, and Richard J. Radke. *Rank Persistence: Assessing the Temporal Performance of Real-World Person Re-Identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset details while providing the necessary citations.
