To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TOYBOX: Better Atari Environments for Testing Reinforcement Learning Agents" by John Foley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the limitations of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and introduces TOYBOX as a solution, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of Atari games as benchmarks for reinforcement learning. They reference ALE but do not provide specific dataset names. 

I will then examine the **system design section** where TOYBOX is described. Here, the authors mention that TOYBOX is a suite of reimplementations of Atari games, but again, they do not specify datasets. 

The **experiments section** is crucial, as it details the testing of the RL agents on the game of Breakout. The authors describe the testing setup and the specific requirements they are evaluating, but they do not refer to external datasets. Instead, they focus on the TOYBOX implementation of the game.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The paper references the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and other works, but it does not provide specific datasets used in the experiments. 

Since the paper primarily discusses the TOYBOX environment and its capabilities rather than external datasets, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note the relevant references that pertain to the Atari games and the ALE, as they are foundational to the context of the research.

The relevant citations from the references section are:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
   > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, jun 2013.

2. **OpenAI Gym** (which is used in conjunction with TOYBOX):
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

In summary, while the paper does not provide specific datasets, it references the foundational environments (ALE and OpenAI Gym) that are critical to understanding the context of the research. I will compile these references for completeness.
