To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Standard Errors for Calibrated Parameters" by Matthew D. Cocci and Mikkel Plagborg-Møller, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical applications sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on calibration and standard errors, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 7 (Empirical Applications)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the empirical analysis. In this case, the authors describe two empirical applications: one related to menu cost pricing for multi-product firms and another involving a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model.

In the first application, the authors mention using **scanner data from the supermarket chain Dominick's**. They provide details about the data cleaning process and the specific moments matched to the structural model. This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their analysis.

For the second application, they refer to impulse response functions obtained from two sets of Structural Vector Autoregression estimates of macroeconomic shocks. They cite specific papers (Chang et al. (2021) and Miranda-Agrippino & Ricco (2021)) that provide the empirical moments used in their analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Scanner Data from Dominick's**:
   - The dataset is described in detail, but a specific citation is not provided in the paper. However, it is referenced as being available from the James M. Kilts Center, University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

2. **Impulse Response Functions from Chang et al. (2021)**:
   - Chang, M., Chen, X., & Schorfheide, F. (2021). Heterogeneity and Aggregate Fluctuations. Manuscript, University of Pennsylvania.

3. **Impulse Response Functions from Miranda-Agrippino & Ricco (2021)**:
   - Miranda-Agrippino, S., & Ricco, G. (2021). The Transmission of Monetary Policy Shocks. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 13(3), 74–107.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the relevant information for each dataset, including their context and significance in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
