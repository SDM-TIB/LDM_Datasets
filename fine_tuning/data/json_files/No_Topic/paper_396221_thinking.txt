To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Neural Network Generalization for Grammar Induction" by Nur Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper provides a benchmark that includes languages such as **anbn, anbncn, anbmcn+m, Dyck-1, and Dyck-2**. This suggests that these languages are part of the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly list the languages included in the benchmark, confirming that the datasets are indeed based on formal languages. The paper states that the dataset includes:

1. **anbn**: A formal language consisting of strings with equal numbers of 'a's followed by 'b's.
2. **anbncn**: A formal language consisting of strings with equal numbers of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.
3. **anbmcn+m**: A formal language where the number of 'b's is fixed while the number of 'a's and 'c's can vary.
4. **Dyck-1**: A language representing well-formed parentheses.
5. **Dyck-2**: A language representing well-formed parentheses with two types of brackets.

The authors also mention that the source code, datasets, and specifications for the benchmark are available at a GitHub repository (https://github.com/taucompling/bliss), which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the works that describe these formal languages. However, since the languages themselves are not attributed to specific papers in the references, I will note that the benchmark is based on established formal language theory and the authors have provided their own sampling methods for generating the datasets.

The relevant citations for the formal languages can be summarized as follows:

- **anbn**: Commonly referenced in works on context-free languages, notably by Gers and Schmidhuber (2001).
- **anbncn**: Also discussed in the context of formal language learning, with references to works like Joulin and Mikolov (2015).
- **anbmcn+m**: This language is a variant discussed in the context of grammar induction.
- **Dyck-1 and Dyck-2**: These languages are well-known in formal language theory, with foundational references in works by Weiss et al. (2018) and others.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for each language, I will note the general references to foundational works in formal language theory.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant information and citations as needed for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
