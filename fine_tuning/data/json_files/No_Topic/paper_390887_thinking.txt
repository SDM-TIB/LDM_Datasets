To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Synergy, Less Redundancy: Exploiting Joint Mutual Information for Self-Supervised Learning" by Salman Mohamadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experimental results on multiple datasets," which indicates that there are several datasets used in the research. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of self-supervised learning (SSL) and mention various baselines and methods, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly state that they used **six datasets**, including **ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet-100, and VOC0712**. This is crucial information that I need to document.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **CIFAR10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **CIFAR100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

4. **Tiny ImageNet**:
   > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

5. **ImageNet-100**:
   > This dataset is a subset of ImageNet, and while it may not have a specific citation in the references, it is generally referenced as a part of the ImageNet dataset.

6. **VOC0712**:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1–8, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset, along with their full citations.
