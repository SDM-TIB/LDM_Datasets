To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal fenestration of the Fontan circulation" by Zan Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a model calibrated to clinical data from Fontan patients, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors discuss the complexities of single ventricle physiology and the need for various models, which may imply the use of clinical datasets.

I will then focus on the **results and discussion** sections, as these often contain detailed references to datasets used for calibration and validation of the models. In this paper, the authors mention calibrating their model using clinical data from Fontan patients, specifically citing a dataset provided by Liang et al. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

In the **methods** section, I will look for any specific datasets used in the modeling process. The authors reference their calibration process and mention using clinical data, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper cites Liang et al. for clinical data, which is essential for my extraction.

The relevant datasets I have identified are:

1. **Clinical data from Fontan patients**: This dataset is used for model calibration and is referenced from Liang et al. The citation is:
   > Fuyou Liang, Hideaki Senzaki, Clara Kurishima, Koichi Sughimoto, Ryo Inuzuka, and Hao Liu. *Hemodynamic performance of the Fontan circulation compared with a normal biventricular circulation: a computational model study*. American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology, 307(7):H1056â€“H1072, 2014.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its citation, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the references as they are critical for academic rigor.
