To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Variational Autoencoders for Multiple Data Imputation" by Breeshey Roskams-Hieter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep generative models for imputation, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for concrete names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention previous work and datasets used for imputation. They reference the **RNA-sequencing dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will note this down as it is crucial for understanding their methodology.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset in more detail, stating that it contains **17,175 complete features for 667 glioma patients**. This provides additional context about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets or provide further details about the TCGA dataset. They confirm that they are using the same publicly available RNA-sequencing dataset from TCGA, which reinforces its importance in their study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the TCGA dataset. The citation for the TCGA dataset is typically provided in the following format:

- For the **RNA-sequencing dataset from TCGA**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Genetics, 2013.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry. The key dataset identified is the RNA-sequencing dataset from TCGA, and I will ensure to include its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
