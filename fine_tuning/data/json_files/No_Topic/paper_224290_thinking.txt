To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dataset Growth in Medical Image Analysis" by Yuval Landau and Nahum Kiryati, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for medical image datasets for training, testing, and validation of algorithms, which indicates that datasets are a central focus of the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of large datasets in medical image analysis, hinting that specific datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, particularly in the **methods** section. Here, the authors describe their approach to analyzing dataset sizes from the MICCAI conference proceedings from 2011 to 2018, focusing on three imaging modalities: MRI, CT, and fMRI. While they do not name specific datasets in this section, they do provide insights into the types of datasets they analyzed.

I will then examine **Tables 3, 4, and 5**, which summarize the average, geometric mean, and median dataset sizes for MRI, CT, and fMRI, respectively. Although these tables provide statistical information about dataset sizes, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

To find the actual datasets used in the studies analyzed, I will refer to the **References section**. The authors cite various papers that likely contain the datasets used in the studies they reviewed. I will look for references that specifically mention datasets related to MRI, CT, and fMRI.

Upon reviewing the references, I will identify the following key citations that are likely associated with the datasets:

1. For MRI datasets, I will look for papers that discuss large MRI datasets used in medical imaging research. A potential citation could be:
   > H. Greenspan, B. van Ginneken, and R. M. Summers. *Deep learning in medical imaging: overview and future promise of an exciting new technique (guest editorial)*. IEEE. Med. Imaging, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 1153-1159, 2016.

2. For CT datasets, I will identify relevant studies that provide large CT datasets. A potential citation could be:
   > B. van Ginneken, S. Kerkstra, and J. Meakin. *Grand challenges in image analysis*. [Online]. Available: https://grand-biomedical-challenge.org.

3. For fMRI datasets, I will look for references that discuss fMRI datasets in detail. A potential citation could be:
   > H.-C. Shin, N. A. Tenenholtz, J. K. Rogers, et al. *Medical image synthesis for data augmentation and anonymization using generative adversarial networks*. arXiv: 1807.10225v2 [cs.CV], 2018.

After gathering the relevant citations, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, along with their respective references for further exploration.
