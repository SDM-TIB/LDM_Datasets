To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Positive Semidefinite Matrix Factorization: A Connection with Phase Retrieval and Affine Rank Minimization" by Dana Lahat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any specific characteristics that define the dataset.

In this paper, the authors mention using **random and geometric datasets** for their numerical experiments. I will need to extract the specific names and details of these datasets. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will note those names as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on previous works. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
