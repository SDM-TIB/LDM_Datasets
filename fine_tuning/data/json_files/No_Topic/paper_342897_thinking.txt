To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MolMiner: You Only Look Once for Chemical Structure Recognition" by Youjun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the software was evaluated on **four benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **benchmark evaluation section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for testing. In this section, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **USPTO Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the MolMiner system. The paper states that it contains 5,719 entries.

2. **UOB Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned, which consists of 5,740 entries.

3. **JPO Dataset**: This dataset is smaller, containing 450 entries.

4. **CLEF2012 Dataset**: This dataset has 992 entries.

The authors provide a summary of these datasets, including their sizes and average molecular weights, which confirms their relevance for the evaluation of the proposed system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **USPTO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kearnes, S. M.; Maser, M. R.; Wleklinski, M.; Kast, A.; Doyle, A. G.; Dreher, S. D.; Hawkins, J. M.; Jensen, K. F.; Coley, C. W. The open reaction database. *Journal of the American Chemical Society* 2021, 143, 18820–18826.

- For the **UOB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rajan, K.; Brinkhaus, H. O.; Zielesny, A.; Steinbeck, C. A review of optical chemical structure recognition tools. *Journal of Cheminformatics* 2020, 12, 60.

- For the **JPO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Filippov, I. V.; Nicklaus, M. C. Optical Structure Recognition Software To Recover Chemical Information: OSRA, An Open Source Solution. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* 2009, 49, 740–743.

- For the **CLEF2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oldenhof, M.; Arany, A.; Moreau, Y.; Simm, J. ChemGrapher: optical graph recognition of chemical compounds by deep learning. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* 2020, 60, 4506–4517.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately described and attributed in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
