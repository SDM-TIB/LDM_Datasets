To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Probabilistic 3D Correspondence Prediction from Sparse Unsegmented Images" by Krithika Iyer and Shireen Y. Elhabian, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions experiments conducted on specific datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **LGE MRI Left Atrium Dataset**: This dataset consists of 923 anonymized Late Gadolinium Enhancement MRIs from distinct patients, which were manually segmented by cardiovascular medicine experts. The details about the dataset's characteristics, such as spatial resolution and preprocessing steps, are also provided.

2. **Abdomen CT-1K Liver Dataset**: This dataset includes 1132 3D CT scans and their corresponding liver segmentations. The authors mention that after quality assessment, 833 samples were selected for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For the **LGE MRI Left Atrium Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned that the data was obtained from the University of Utah Division of Cardiovascular Medicine. I will note this as it indicates the source of the dataset.

For the **Abdomen CT-1K Liver Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ma, J., Zhang, Y., Gu, S., Zhu, C., Ge, C., Zhang, Y., An, X., Wang, C., Wang, Q., Liu, X., Cao, S., Zhang, Q., Liu, S., Wang, Y., Li, Y., He, J., Yang, X. (2022). AbdomenCT-1K: Is abdominal organ segmentation a solved problem? *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 44(10), 6695â€“6714. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3100536

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
