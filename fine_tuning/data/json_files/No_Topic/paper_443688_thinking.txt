To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PenSLR: Persian end-to-end Sign Language Recognition Using Ensembling" by Amirparsa Salmankhah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new PSL dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets they collected. They mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset1-3**: This dataset includes samples from 16 commonly used PSL glosses, with a total of over 3000 samples. It consists of one-word, two-word, and three-word sentences, recorded by five volunteers. The authors note that each volunteer recorded an average of 100 one-word sentences, 300 two-word sentences, and 200 three-word sentences.

2. **Dataset4-8**: This dataset contains longer sentences, specifically 4 to 8-word sentences, aimed at evaluating the model's ability to recognize longer sequences. The authors indicate that this dataset was also recorded by the same volunteers.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are original contributions of the authors and do not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are publicly available on GitHub, which is a crucial detail for researchers interested in accessing the data.

The authors provide a link to the dataset:
- **PenSLR Dataset**: Available at https://github.com/Persian-Sign-Language/PenSLR-dataset

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and the relevant citation information:

1. **Dataset1-3**: A dataset comprising over 3000 samples from 16 PSL glosses, including one-word, two-word, and three-word sentences. Recorded by five volunteers.

2. **Dataset4-8**: A dataset containing longer sentences (4 to 8 words) to evaluate the model's performance on longer sequences. Also recorded by the same five volunteers.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details for each dataset, including the public availability link.

By following this methodical approach, I ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper while providing proper citations and access details.
