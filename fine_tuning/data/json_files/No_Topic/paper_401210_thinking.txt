To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Deconvolution for Node Representation Learning on Large-scale Attributed Graphs" by Zhihao Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments demonstrate the proposed method's performance on **Open Graph Benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention three datasets:

1. **ogbn-arxiv**: This dataset consists of citation networks with textual titles and abstracts. It has a total of 169,343 nodes and 1,157,799 edges, and the evaluation metric used is accuracy.

2. **ogbn-product**: This dataset is a co-purchase network with textual descriptions for products. It contains 2,449,029 nodes and 61,859,076 edges, with accuracy as the evaluation metric.

3. **ogbn-protein**: This dataset represents protein-protein association networks based on protein sequences. It has 132,534 nodes and 39,561,252 edges, and the evaluation metric is ROC-AUC.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors mention that these datasets are part of the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**, which is a widely-used resource for machine learning on graphs.

The full citation for the Open Graph Benchmark datasets is:
> Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020, pp. 22,118â€“22,133.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the information is clear and complete for future reference.
