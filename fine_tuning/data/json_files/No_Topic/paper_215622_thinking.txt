To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Drift in Multilingual Representations" by Lisa Beinborn and Rochelle Choenni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their methodology and the types of analyses they performed, which may include references to specific datasets. I will pay attention to any datasets that are introduced as part of their experimental design.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SWADESH Words**: This dataset consists of a list of 205 semantic concepts that are universal across languages, originally compiled by Morris Swadesh. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Swadesh, Morris. 1955. *Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistic dating*. International Journal of American Linguistics, 21(2):121–137.

2. **PEREIRA Words**: This dataset includes 180 words selected through spectral clustering on word representations, originally intended for brain imaging experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pereira, Francisco, Bin Lou, Brianna Pritchett, Samuel Ritter, Samuel J. Gershman, Nancy Kanwisher, Matthew Botvinick, and Evelina Fedorenko. 2018. *Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation*. Nature Communications, 9(1).

3. **EUROPARL Sentences**: This dataset is derived from the EUROPARL corpus, which contains sentence-aligned versions in 21 European languages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Koehn, Philipp. 2005. *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In MT summit, volume 5, pages 79–86.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations and any additional details that may be relevant for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
