To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Complexity and Typology of Inflectional Morphological Systems" by Ryan Cotterell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the study quantifies the linguistic complexity of different languages' morphological systems and mentions using collections of orthographic paradigms from 31 typologically diverse languages. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the **UniMorph dataset**, which is a significant dataset used for their analysis. They mention that it contains annotated full paradigms extracted from various sources, including Wiktionary.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UniMorph dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **UniMorph Dataset**: 
  > Sylak-Glassman, J., Kirov, C., Yarowsky, D., & Que, R. (2015). A language-independent feature schema for inflectional morphology. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (ACL), pages 674â€“680, Beijing, China, July. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss using verbal paradigms from 23 languages and nominal paradigms from 31 languages, but they do not specify additional datasets beyond UniMorph.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. The final output will be a structured summary of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
