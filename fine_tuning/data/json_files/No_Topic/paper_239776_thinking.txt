To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCNAS: Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation" by Xiong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on several public semantic image segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is highlighted as a large-scale dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. The authors report achieving 84.3% mIoU on this dataset.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: Another significant dataset mentioned, where the authors achieved an mIoU of 86.9%. This dataset is a well-known benchmark for object segmentation.

3. **ADE20K**: The authors also mention this dataset, indicating that their model retains leading performance when evaluated on it.

4. **PASCAL-Context**: This dataset is mentioned as well, with the authors stating that their model performs well on it.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cityscapes**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
