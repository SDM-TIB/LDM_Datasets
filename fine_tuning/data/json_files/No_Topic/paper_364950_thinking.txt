To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Data Generation and Active Learning for Low-Resource Question Answering" by Max Kimmich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on domain-specific datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they refer to:

1. **SQuAD**: This dataset is used as the source domain for training the models. The authors mention it in the context of needing a large amount of annotated data for training.

2. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is identified as one of the target domains for their experiments, which is crucial for evaluating their approach.

3. **TechQA**: Another target domain dataset mentioned, which is specifically tailored for technical question answering.

4. **BioASQ**: This dataset is also used as a target domain, focusing on biomedical question answering.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, which helps confirm their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 238–244.

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Kelcey, M., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K.N., Jones, L., Chang, M.W., Dai, A., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., Petrov, S. (2019). Natural Questions: a Benchmark for Question Answering Research. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 7, 453–466.

- For **TechQA**, the citation is:
  > Castelli, V., Chakravarti, R., Dana, S., Ferritto, A., Florian, R., Franz, M., Garg, D., Khandelwal, D., McCarley, S., McCawley, M., Nasr, M., Pan, L., Pendus, C., Pitrelli, J., Pujar, S., Roukos, S., Sakrajda, A., Sil, A., Uceda-Sosa, R., Ward, T., Zhang, R. (2019). The TechQA Dataset. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **BioASQ**, the citation is:
  > Tsatsaronis, G., Balikas, G., Malakasiotis, P., Partalas, I., Zschunke, M., Alvers, M.R., Weissenborn, D., Krithara, A., Petridis, S., Polychronopoulos, D., Almiranits, Y., Pavlopoulos, J., Baskiotis, N., Gallinari, P., Artiéres, T., Ngomo, A.C.N., Heino, N., Gaussier, E., Barrio-Alvers, L., Schroeder, M., Androutsopoulos, I., Paliouras, G. (2015). An overview of the BIOASQ large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition. BMC Bioinformatics, 16(1), 138.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
