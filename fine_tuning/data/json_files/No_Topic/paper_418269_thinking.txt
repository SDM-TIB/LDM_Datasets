To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IRIS: Inverse Rendering of Indoor Scenes from Low Dynamic Range Images" by Zhi-Hao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a dataset, which indicates that there may be specific datasets discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **FIPT dataset** for their evaluations. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and any specific scenes it contains.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation methodology and confirm that they used the **FIPT dataset**, which consists of both synthetic and real-world scenes. This section provides context on how the dataset was utilized in their experiments, which is crucial for understanding its relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **FIPT dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Liwen Wu, Rui Zhu, Mustafa B Yaldiz, Yinhao Zhu, Hong Cai, Janarbek Matai, Fatih Porikli, Tzu-Mao Li, Manmohan Chandraker, and Ravi Ramamoorthi. *Factorized inverse path tracing for efficient and accurate material-lighting estimation*. In ICCV, 2023.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **FIPT dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
