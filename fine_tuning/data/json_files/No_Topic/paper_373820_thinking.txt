To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAD: Towards Principled Adversarial Malware Detection Against Evasion Attacks" by Deqiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on **two Android malware datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they refer to:

1. **Drebin Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 5,560 malicious apps and features extracted from 42,333 benign apps. They mention that the dataset was collected before 2013 and that it has been used widely in the literature.

2. **Malscan Dataset**: This dataset includes 11,583 malicious apps and 11,613 benign apps, spanning from 2011 to 2018. The authors explain how the apps are labeled using VirusTotal, with specific criteria for determining whether an app is malicious or benign.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

- For the **Drebin Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., et al. "Drebin: Effective and explainable detection of android malware in your pocket." In NDSS, vol. 14. San Diego, California, USA: The Internet Society, 2014, pp. 23–26.

- For the **Malscan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Li, X., Zou, D., et al. "Malscan: Fast market-wide mobile malware scanning by social-network centrality analysis." In 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on ASE, San Diego, CA, USA, November 11-15, 2019, pp. 139–150.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Drebin Dataset**: Contains 5,560 malicious apps and 42,333 benign apps.
   - Citation: Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., et al. "Drebin: Effective and explainable detection of android malware in your pocket." In NDSS, vol. 14. San Diego, California, USA: The Internet Society, 2014, pp. 23–26.

2. **Malscan Dataset**: Contains 11,583 malicious apps and 11,613 benign apps.
   - Citation: Wu, Y., Li, X., Zou, D., et al. "Malscan: Fast market-wide mobile malware scanning by social-network centrality analysis." In 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on ASE, San Diego, CA, USA, November 11-15, 2019, pp. 139–150.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
