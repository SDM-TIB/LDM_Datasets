To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained VR Sketching: Dataset and Insights" by Ling Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present a dataset of **1,497 3D VR sketch and 3D shape pairs** specifically for the chair category. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions the dataset's purpose and its significance in the context of fine-grained data analysis and 3D shape retrieval. It emphasizes the dataset's role in enabling novel applications, which reinforces its importance.

I will then look into the **data collection** section, which provides detailed information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of **1,497 sketches for a subset of 1,005 3D chairs** from the ShapeNetCore dataset. This section also outlines the rationale behind choosing the chair category due to its large intra-class variability, which is crucial for fine-grained tasks.

In the **experiments** section, the authors confirm the use of this dataset for their evaluations, further validating its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset, which is the source of the 3D chair shapes used in their dataset. The citation for the ShapeNet dataset is:

> Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **VR Sketch Dataset**: This dataset contains **1,497 3D VR sketch and 3D shape pairs** specifically for the chair category, which is designed for fine-grained 3D shape retrieval tasks.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The dataset of 3D shapes used for the VR sketches is sourced from the ShapeNet dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
