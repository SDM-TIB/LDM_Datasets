To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoiser-based projections for 2D super-resolution multi-reference alignment" by Jonathan Shani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their numerical experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **CBSD-68 dataset** and a **cryo-EM image of the E. coli 70S ribosome**. I will note down these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **CBSD-68 dataset**, the citation is:
   > "CBSD-68 dataset." Available at: https://github.com/JonathanShani/Denoiser projection.

2. For the **E. coli 70S ribosome cryo-EM image**, the citation is:
   > "Electron Microscopy Data Bank." Available at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
