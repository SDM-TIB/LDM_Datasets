To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness without the sensitive attribute via Causal Variational Autoencoder" by Vincent Grari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on **two real datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work and may reference the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the **Adult UCI** dataset and the **Default dataset**, which are likely the datasets they utilized for their empirical evaluations.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any additional details about how these datasets were used, including any preprocessing steps or specific characteristics that might be relevant for understanding the datasets.

Then, I will check the **experimental results** section, where the authors present their findings based on the datasets. They explicitly mention the **Adult UCI** dataset and the **Default dataset** again, confirming their use in the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Adult UCI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

- For the **Default dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yoon, J., & Hwang, S. (2019). *Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset*. [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
