To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equity and Fairness of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing" by Sebastian Tschiatschek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the development of equitable tutoring systems and mentions experiments, which may indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be explicitly referenced. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setups and the models they used, which may include specific datasets.

As I read through section 6, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. The authors mention using interaction data from students, but I need to find specific dataset names or descriptions.

In the **related work section** (section 2), the authors reference previous studies that may have used datasets relevant to their work. I will check if any of these studies provide dataset names that I can include in my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

If the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will note that as well, indicating that while the authors discuss the use of datasets, they do not specify which datasets were used.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations according to academic standards, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, clearly listing each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
