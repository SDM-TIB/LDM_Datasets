To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision based Crop Row Navigation under Varying Field Conditions in Arable Fields" by Rajitha de Silva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a dataset for crop row detection, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any additional context or details about the dataset mentioned in the abstract. The introduction discusses the challenges in crop row detection and hints at the need for comprehensive datasets, reinforcing the importance of the dataset presented.

I will then focus on **section III (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the **CRDLDv2.1 (Crop Row Detection Lincoln Dataset)**, which was captured using an Intel Realsense D435i camera. The dataset includes images from Sugar Beet and Maize crops, categorized into 50 data classes based on 11 identified field variations.

I will note the key details about the dataset:
- The dataset includes images from two crops (Sugar Beet and Maize).
- It consists of 50 data classes representing various combinations of field variations.
- The dataset is an update from a previous version (CRDLDv2.0) and includes additional Maize crop data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset can be accessed via a GitHub link, which is important for providing access to the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> R. de Silva, G. Cielniak, G. Wang, and J. Gao, “Deep learning-based crop row following for infield navigation of agri-robots,” 2022. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04278

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as CRDLDv2.1, described its contents and variations, and located the citation for proper referencing. This will allow me to present the dataset information clearly and accurately.
