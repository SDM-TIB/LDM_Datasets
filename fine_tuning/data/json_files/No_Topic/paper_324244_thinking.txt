To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Adaptation of Neural Network Models by Modified Extended Kalman Filter for Customizable and Transferable Driving Behavior Prediction" by Letian Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of human behavior prediction and mentions the use of real human driving data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment section**, where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **INTERACTION dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their empirical studies, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiment section**, the authors state that they verified their method with real driving data from the INTERACTION dataset (Zhan et al. 2019). They describe how the model is trained on the MA intersection scenario and tested on the FT roundabout scenario. This confirms the dataset's relevance and application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the INTERACTION dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Zhan, W.; Sun, L.; Wang, D.; Shi, H.; Clausse, A.; Naumann, M.; Kümmerle, J.; Königshof, H.; Stiller, C.; de La Fortelle, A.; and Tomizuka, M. 2019. INTERACTION Dataset: An INTERnational, Adversarial and Cooperative moTION in Interactive Driving Scenarios with Semantic Maps. arXiv:1910.03088 [cs, eess].

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **INTERACTION Dataset**: This dataset includes real driving data collected from various interactive driving scenarios, specifically designed to evaluate driving behavior prediction models. It contains data points from different scenarios, including the MA intersection and FT roundabout.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
