To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Optimal Classification Trees Robust to Distribution Shifts" by Nathan Justin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the datasets used, while the introduction may elaborate on their significance in the context of the research.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a dedicated **Datasets** section or any part of the **Experiments** section where datasets are described. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **numerous publicly available datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

I will then compile a list of the datasets mentioned throughout the paper. For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This is usually mentioned directly in the text.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains or its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** as a source for datasets, I will look for specific datasets listed in the paper, such as "balance-scale" or "breast-cancer", and find their respective citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation in a structured format.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a comprehensive list that can be easily referenced or used for further analysis.
