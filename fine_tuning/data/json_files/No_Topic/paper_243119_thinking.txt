To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Data Normalization Method to Improve Dialogue Generation by Minimizing Long Tail Effect" by Zhiqiang Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setups sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments based on three datasets collected from social media, subtitles, and an industrial application. This suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Setups)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the Twitter Corpus used in previous research. It consists of conversational data from Twitter.

2. **Subtitle Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the OpenSubtitles dataset, which contains dialogues from movie subtitles.

3. **Lenovo Dataset**: This dataset comprises conversations collected between customers and online customer service representatives.

In this section, the authors also provide statistical information about each dataset, such as vocabulary size, total word count, number of unknown words, number of sentences, average sentence length, and word entropy.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from existing corpora, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets:

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alan Ritter, Colin Cherry, and William B. Dolan. *Data-driven response generation in social media*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2011, pages 583–593, 2011.

- For the **OpenSubtitles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iulian Vlad Serban et al. *Building end-to-end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models*. In Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 3776–3784, 2016.

- For the **Lenovo Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned that it consists of collected conversations from customer service interactions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
