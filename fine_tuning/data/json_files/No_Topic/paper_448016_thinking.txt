To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D2E: An Autonomous Decision-Making Dataset involving Driver States and Human Evaluation" by Zehong Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract introduces the D2E dataset, which is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. It highlights the dataset's focus on driver states, vehicle states, environmental situations, and human evaluations. This indicates that the D2E dataset is the main dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the dataset, particularly **section III (Method)**, where the authors describe the D2E dataset in more detail. Here, they explain the components of the dataset, including the types of data collected (e.g., physiological signals, eye-tracking data, first-person view videos, and evaluation scores from human reviewers). This section confirms that D2E is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.

In **section IV (Dataset Organization and Analysis)**, the authors provide further insights into how the dataset is structured and the types of data it contains. They mention that the D2E dataset includes data from both driving simulators and real-world driving, which adds to its comprehensiveness.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the D2E dataset. Since the dataset is introduced and described in this paper, I will use the paper itself as the citation for the D2E dataset.

The full citation for the D2E dataset is:
> Zehong Ke, Yanbo Jiang, Yuning Wang, Hao Cheng, Jinhao Li, and Jianqiang Wang. "D2E: An Autonomous Decision-Making Dataset involving Driver States and Human Evaluation." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the D2E dataset, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the full citation.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the main dataset.
2. Review the methodology section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Check the references for the full citation of the dataset.
4. Compile the dataset entry with all relevant details.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the dataset information from the research paper.
