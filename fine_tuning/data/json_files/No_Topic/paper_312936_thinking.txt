To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Datasets of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns" by Maria Korosteleva and Sung-Hee Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a "large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D garment models with their sewing patterns," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **Methods** and **Dataset Generation System** sections. Here, the authors describe their dataset generation pipeline and mention that they created a dataset containing "23500 garment design samples," which passed quality checks. This section is crucial as it provides insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **Dataset** section, the authors elaborate on the dataset's contents, stating that it includes both clean meshes and versions with scanning artifacts. They also mention the division of templates into training and test groups, which is important for understanding how the dataset can be utilized.

I will also check the **References section** for the citation of the dataset. The authors provide a specific reference for their dataset:

- For the dataset of 3D garments with sewing patterns, the citation is:
  > Maria Korosteleva and Sung-Hee Lee. *Dataset of 3D garments with sewing patterns*. Zenodo. doi:10.5281/zenodo.5267549, URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549, June 2021.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns**: This dataset contains 23,500 garment design samples, including both clean meshes and versions with scanning artifacts. It was generated using a flexible pipeline that allows for the creation of various garment designs based on sewing pattern templates.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's key attributes and ensures that the citation is included for reference. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the dataset in related research.
