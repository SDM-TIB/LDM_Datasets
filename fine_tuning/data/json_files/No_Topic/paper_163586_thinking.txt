To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cubic Range Error Model for Stereo Vision with Illuminators" by Marius Huber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the experimental validation of a range error model using an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental methodology. Here, they mention using the **Intel RealSense R200** depth sensor and detail two different experimental setups: one with the camera perpendicular to the surface and another with the camera tilted. They specify that they collected data from these experiments, which indicates that there are datasets generated from these experiments.

In **section V (Results)**, the authors present results from the experiments, including figures and statistical analyses. They mention capturing **300 images** at various distances for the perpendicular setup and **600 images** for the tilted setup. This information is crucial as it provides insight into the scale and nature of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or systems mentioned. The paper does not explicitly name datasets in the traditional sense (like benchmark datasets), but it does refer to the **Intel RealSense R200** as the sensor used for data collection. Therefore, I will provide a citation for this sensor as it is integral to the experiments.

The citation for the Intel RealSense R200 is:
> Intel Corporation. *Intel RealSense R200 Camera*. [Online]. Available: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html

Additionally, I will note that the experiments involve data collected from the camera under different conditions, but no specific datasets are named beyond the experimental data itself.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Intel RealSense R200 camera as it is the primary source of the experimental data.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
