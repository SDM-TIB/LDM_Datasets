To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Suspicion-Free Adversarial Attacks on Clustering Algorithms" by Anshuman Chhabra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical results on a number of datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **UCI Handwritten Digits Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8 × 8 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The authors apply Ward’s clustering on this dataset.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 28 × 28 grayscale images. The authors use subsets of this dataset for clustering experiments.

3. **UCI Wheat Seeds Dataset**: This dataset contains measurements of geometric properties of three different varieties of wheat kernels. The authors use K-Means clustering on this dataset.

4. **MoCap Hand Postures Dataset**: This dataset consists of hand postures recorded in a motion capture environment. The authors use K-Means clustering for this dataset as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **UCI Handwritten Digits Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alpaydin, E., and Kaynak, C. (1995). Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, 1995. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For the **UCI Wheat Seeds Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Charytanowicz, M., Niewczas, J., Kulczycki, P., Kowalski, P. A., Łukasik, S., and Zak, S. (2010). Complete gradient clustering algorithm for features analysis of x-ray images. In Information technologies in biomedicine. Springer, 15–24.

- For the **MoCap Hand Postures Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gardner, A., Kanno, J., Duncan, C. A., and Selmic, R. (2014). Measuring distance between unordered sets of different sizes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 137–143.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are accurately documented for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help in efficiently extracting and citing the datasets used in the research paper.
