To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on the Efficiency of the Indian Stock Market" by Devansh Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the relevant datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **daily closing values of Sensex and Nifty indices** for the period from April 2010 to March 2019, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (Section 3) more closely, which states that the study uses the daily closing values for the Sensex and Nifty indices over the specified time frame. This confirms that these two datasets are central to the research.

I will also look into the **results section** to ensure that these datasets are utilized in the analysis and to gather any additional context about their application. The results of the Runs Test, Autocorrelation Test, and Autoregression Test all rely on the data from these indices, further validating their importance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from stock market indices, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will provide a description of the sources:

1. **Sensex Index**: The dataset consists of daily closing values of the Sensex index from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) for the period from April 2010 to March 2019. The Sensex is a stock market index that represents 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE.

2. **Nifty Index**: The dataset includes daily closing values of the Nifty index from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) for the same period. The Nifty is a stock market index that represents 50 of the largest and most liquid stocks on the NSE.

Since these indices are widely recognized and published by their respective exchanges, I will reference them accordingly:

- For **Sensex**, the citation is:
  > Bombay Stock Exchange. *BSE Sensex Historical Data*. Available at: [BSE Website](https://www.bseindia.com)

- For **Nifty**, the citation is:
  > National Stock Exchange of India. *Nifty 50 Historical Data*. Available at: [NSE Website](https://www.nseindia.com)

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the information is clear and accessible for further use or analysis.
