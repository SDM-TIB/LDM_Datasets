To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Robots to Books: An Introduction to Smart Applications of AI in Education (AIEd)" by Shubham Ojha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and applications sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific mentions of datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or studies that might have utilized specific datasets. The introduction may provide context but is less likely to contain detailed dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, particularly the subsections that describe the research design and data collection methods. This section often contains explicit mentions of datasets used for analysis or experiments.

I will pay special attention to the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as they often summarize key findings and may list datasets used in various studies. For instance, in the tables that provide overviews of works covered under different applications of AI in education, I will look for any dataset names mentioned alongside the corresponding studies.

In the **applications section**, I will identify specific applications of AI in education and check if any datasets are referenced in the context of those applications. For example, the tables summarizing works under categories like "Instructor's Workload Decrement," "Adaptive Curriculum," "Intelligent Tutoring Systems," and "Smart Assessments" will be crucial.

Once I identify the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as proper attribution is essential for academic integrity.

From the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Self-Collected Datasets for Talk Moves Application**: This dataset consists of 175,757 sentences of various types used to provide feedback to teachers.
   - Citation: Suresh, Abhijit & Jacobs, Jennifer & Lai, Vivian & Tan, Chenhao & Ward, Wayne & Martin, James & Sumner, Tamara. Using Transformers to Provide Teachers with Personalized Feedback on their Classroom Discourse: The TalkMoves Application. (2021). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2105.07949

2. **GeoQA Dataset**: A dataset with 4,998 geometric questions used for solving geometric problems.
   - Citation: Jiaqi Chen, Jianheng Tang, Jinghui Qin, Xiaodan Liang, Lingbo Liu, Eric P. Xing, Liang Lin. GeoQA: A Geometric Question Answering Benchmark towards Multimodal Numerical Reasoning. (2022). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2105.14517

3. **IAM Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for handwriting recognition used in the Full Page Handwriting Recognition study.
   - Citation: Sumeet S. Singh, Sergey Karayev. Full Page Handwriting Recognition via Image to Sequence Extraction. (2022). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.06450

4. **University Course Dataset and NPTEL MOOC Dataset**: Used for the PREREQ study to identify prerequisite relations in online educational resources.
   - Citation: S. Roy, M. Madhyastha, S. Lawrence, and V. Rajan. Inferring Concept Prerequisite Relations from Online Educational Resources. AAAI, vol. 33, no. 01, pp. 9589-9594, (2019).

5. **IM2LATEX-100K Dataset**: A dataset with rendered mathematical expressions from published papers used in the OCR for latex-based documents.
   - Citation: Deng, Y., Kanervisto, A., & Rush, A.M. What You Get Is What You See: A Visual Markup Decompiler. (2016). ArXiv, abs/1609.04938.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations for further processing or review.
