To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ImageNet MPEG-7 Visual Descriptors" by Frédéric Rayar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper presents the extraction of MPEG-7 visual descriptors from the ImageNet database, indicating that ImageNet is a significant dataset involved in this research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in **section III (Files Description)**, where the author discusses the two MPEG-7 visual descriptors provided for the ImageNet dataset: the Colour Layout Descriptor (CLD) and the Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD). The section mentions that a total of 14,197,060 images from ImageNet have been processed, which confirms the dataset's scale and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei, “ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database,” in CVPR09, 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the descriptors derived from the ImageNet dataset, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset entry.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for ImageNet, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
