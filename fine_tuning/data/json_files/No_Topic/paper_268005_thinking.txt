To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On utility maximization without passing by the dual problem" by Miklós Rásonyi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss examples or applications** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and any **examples** or **applications** sections that may detail the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any **specific examples** or **theorems** that might reference datasets. For instance, if the paper discusses empirical results or simulations, it may mention datasets used for those analyses. I will also check if there are any **figures or tables** that might summarize data or results derived from specific datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will note their names and descriptions. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the context in which these datasets are used, including any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics that define the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I include all necessary details in the citations, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. However, if I do find datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
