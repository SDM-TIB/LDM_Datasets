To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Documents" by Mobashir Sadat and Cornelia Caragea, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce a new dataset called **SciHTC**, which is a clear indication that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The SciHTC Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's size, structure, and the hierarchical classification based on the ACM CCS tree. They mention that the SciHTC dataset contains **186,160 papers** and **1,233 categories**.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention several existing datasets, including:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A hierarchically classified dataset with about **50,000 papers**.
2. **Web of Science (WoS) Dataset**: Contains **46,985 papers** but lacks titles.
3. **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**: A dataset of **25,000 papers**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors compare their dataset with these existing datasets, which reinforces their significance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

- For **SciHTC**, the citation is:
  > Mobashir Sadat and Cornelia Caragea. *Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Documents*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Publisher].

- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Kachites McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Inf. Retr., 3(2):127–163, 2000.

- For **Web of Science (WoS) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kamran Kowsari, Donald E Brown, Mojtaba Heidarysafa, Kiana Jafari Meimandi, Matthew S Gerber, and Laura E Barnes. *Hierarchical deep learning for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 2017 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pages 201–206, 2017.

- For **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**, the citation is:
  > Arman Cohan, Sergey Feldman, Iz Beltagy, Doug Downey, and Daniel S. Weld. *Document-level representation learning using citation-informed transformers*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 3615–3620, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
