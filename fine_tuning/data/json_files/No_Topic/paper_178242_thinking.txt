To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Truncated Variational EM for Semi-Supervised Neural Simpletrons" by Dennis Forster and Jörg Lücke, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **MNIST dataset** and the **NIST SD19 dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section (Section IV)** where the authors describe their numerical experiments. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **NIST SD19 dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the number of samples and any specific characteristics mentioned.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper states that the MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits, which have been size-normalized to 28×28 pixel grayscale images. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **NIST SD19 Dataset**: The authors describe the NIST SD19 dataset as comprising 344,307 training and 58,646 test samples of handwritten digits (10 classes) and 387,361 training and 23,941 test samples of handwritten characters (52 classes). This dataset is also significant for evaluating semi-supervised learning methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **NIST SD19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. J. Grother. *NIST special database 19 handprinted forms and characters database*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 1995.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
