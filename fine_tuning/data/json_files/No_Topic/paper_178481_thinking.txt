To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breeding Electric Zebras" by Federico Cabitza, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research context and may mention any datasets used for analysis or experimentation. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Methods," "Data," or "Experiments."** In these sections, the author may describe the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and purpose. 

While reading, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For instance, if the author mentions a dataset related to medical imaging or machine learning, I will highlight that information for further investigation.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will look for any papers, articles, or reports that are cited in relation to the datasets mentioned in the text.

If the paper refers to datasets that are not directly cited, I will note the context in which they are mentioned and search for their original sources online or in academic databases to ensure I can provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative.

Finally, I will organize the extracted dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
