To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Bandits with Stage-wise Constraints" by Aldo Pacchiano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4 and Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing of their algorithms. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that indicate their size or structure.

In this paper, the authors discuss various algorithms and their performance on different datasets. I will note any datasets that are mentioned in the context of experiments, such as the "Penn Action Dataset" or "sub-JHMDB Dataset" in the previous example.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation, which might be formatted as follows:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing proper citations.
