To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Node Representation with Attribute Decoding" by Xiaohui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using several benchmark datasets for their experiments, specifically in the **Experiments** section. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of these datasets.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network consisting of 2,708 documents from seven categories, with 5,429 links and bag-of-words feature vectors of length 1,433.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network consisting of 3,312 scientific publications from six categories, with 4,732 links and bag-of-words feature vectors of length 3,703.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network consisting of 19,717 scientific publications from three categories, with 44,338 links and bag-of-words feature vectors of length 500.
4. **DBLP**: A citation network consisting of 17,716 papers from four categories, with 105,734 links and bag-of-words feature vectors of length 1,639.
5. **OGBL-collab**: A collaboration network consisting of 235,868 authors, with 1,285,465 links and a 128-dimensional feature vector.
6. **OGBN-arxiv**: A citation network consisting of 169,343 papers from forty categories, with 1,166,243 links and a 128-dimensional feature vector.
7. **Wiki-cs**: A Wikipedia-based network consisting of 11,701 subjects from ten categories, with 216,123 links and node feature vectors of length 300.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, the citation for the Cora dataset is:
> McCallum, A., & Koller, D. (2005). *Probabilistic models for information retrieval*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI).

I will repeat this process for each dataset, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
