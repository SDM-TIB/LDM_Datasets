To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Invariant Representations with a Nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson Head" by Alan Q. Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on "three challenging real-world domain generalization tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors summarize the datasets in **Table 1** and provide detailed descriptions in the **Experiments and Results** section.

From **Table 1**, I can identify the datasets used:

1. **Camelyon-17**: This dataset is used for a medical image classification task involving lymph-node scans from different hospitals. The environment is defined by the hospital where the images were collected.

2. **ISIC**: This dataset consists of dermoscopic images of skin lesions, where the label indicates whether the lesion is diagnosed as melanoma. The environment is also defined by the hospital from which the images were collected.

3. **FMoW (Functional Map of the World)**: This dataset includes RGB satellite images categorized into 62 classes based on building or land use, with the environment representing the year and geographical region of the images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Camelyon-17**, the citation is:
  > Péter Bándi et al. "From detection of individual metastases to classification of lymph node status at the patient level: The camelyon17 challenge." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 38(2):550–560, 2019. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2018.2867350.

- For **ISIC**, the citation is:
  > Noel Codella et al. "Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)." *Eprint arXiv:1902.03368*, 2019.

- For **FMoW**, the citation is:
  > Gordon Christie et al. "Functional map of the world." *2018*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
