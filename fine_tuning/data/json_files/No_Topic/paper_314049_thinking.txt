To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trends in Publishing Blockchain Surveys: A Bibliometric Perspective" by Hira Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it mentions the analysis of 801 survey papers, it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **Section 3 (Data Collection and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they scraped data from Google Scholar using specific keywords related to blockchain surveys. This indicates that the dataset consists of survey papers collected from Google Scholar, but I need to confirm the details.

In this section, the authors state that they collected **801 articles** published from January 2017 to September 2021. They also list the attributes extracted from these articles, such as paper title, publisher, type of venue, year, citation count, and more. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or a formal citation for this dataset.

Since the dataset is derived from Google Scholar and does not have a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is a collection of survey papers on blockchain published in various venues. The authors do not provide a specific reference for the dataset itself, as it is based on their own data collection process.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Blockchain Survey Papers Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of 801 survey papers published from January 2017 to September 2021, scraped from Google Scholar using specific keywords related to blockchain surveys.
   - **Citation**: No formal citation provided, as the dataset is based on the authors' own data collection from Google Scholar.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude my extraction process here. I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
