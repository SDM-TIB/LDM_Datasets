To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons and When Parametric Assumptions Donâ€™t Help" by Reinhard Heckel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. If the authors mention any datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

In this paper, the authors discuss pairwise comparisons and ranking algorithms, but they also reference datasets used for empirical validation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or their properties.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "PlaNYC" survey data or "OECD" proposals, I will look for the corresponding citations in the references. If the datasets are derived from other studies or papers, I will ensure to cite those original sources as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information systematically for clarity and accuracy.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
