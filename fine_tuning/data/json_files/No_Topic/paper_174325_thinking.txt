To extract datasets from the research paper titled "First-Person Action-Object Detection with EgoNet" by Gedas Bertasius et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the concept of action-objects and mentions the use of a new dataset for evaluating the proposed EgoNet model. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section III (First-Person Action-Object RGBD Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they collected. Here, they mention that the dataset captures people performing seven different activities and includes 4247 frames with RGB and DHG (depth, height, grayscale) inputs, along with annotated per-pixel action-object masks. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

The authors also compare their dataset to existing datasets, specifically mentioning the **GTEA Gaze+ dataset** and the **Social Children Interaction dataset**. I will note these datasets as they are relevant to the context of the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **First-Person Action-Object RGBD Dataset**: The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is newly introduced. However, I will note that it is created by the authors and includes detailed annotations.

2. **GTEA Gaze+ Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yin Li, Zhefan Ye, and James M. Rehg. *Delving into egocentric actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

3. **Social Children Interaction Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hyun Soo Park and Jianbo Shi. *Social saliency prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
