To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Deep Neural Networks for All-Cause Mortality Prediction from LDCT Images" by Pingkun Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LDCT images and coronary artery calcification risk scores for mortality prediction, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and its findings, indicating that this trial's data may be relevant. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials)**, where the authors describe the data used in their study. They mention that all study data were acquired from the NLST, which is a significant dataset for lung cancer screening. They specify that the study involved 180 subjects, divided into survivors and non-survivors, and detail the inclusion criteria and the imaging methods used.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further details about the NLST data used for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NLST dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**, the citation is:
  > National Lung Screening Trial Research Team, Denise R. Aberle, Amanda M. Adams, Christine D. Berg, William C. Black, Jonathan D. Clapp, Richard M. Fagerstrom, Ilana F. Gareen, Constantine Gatsonis, Pamela M. Marcus, and JoRean D. Sicks. "Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening." *The New England Journal of Medicine*, vol. 365, no. 5, pp. 395â€“409, Aug. 2011.

Since the NLST is a well-known dataset, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset entry.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the NLST into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
