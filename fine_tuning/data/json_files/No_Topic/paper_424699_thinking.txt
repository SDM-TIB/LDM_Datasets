To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential & Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents" by Dominik Jeurissen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of NetPlay, an LLM-powered agent for the game NetHack, but does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **background section** to look for any references to datasets used in the context of NetHack or related environments. The authors mention the **NetHack Learning Environment (NLE)** and **MiniHack**, which are frameworks for reinforcement learning in the context of NetHack. However, I need to confirm if these are considered datasets or just environments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation of NetPlay and mention using the **Valkyrie role** in NetHack for their experiments. They also refer to the **NeurIPS 2021 NetHack Challenge**, which may have associated datasets, but again, I need to verify if these are explicitly named datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets or environments. The references include works related to NetHack and LLMs, but I need to determine if any of these references provide datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not provide specific datasets with full citations. Instead, they reference environments and challenges related to NetHack, such as:

1. **NetHack Learning Environment (NLE)**: 
   - Citation: H. Küttler et al., “The NetHack Learning Environment,” CoRR, vol. abs/2006.13760, 2020. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13760

2. **MiniHack**: 
   - Citation: M. Samvelyan et al., “MiniHack the Planet: A Sandbox for Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning Research,” CoRR, vol. abs/2109.13202, 2021. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13202

3. **NeurIPS 2021 NetHack Challenge**: 
   - Citation: E. Hambro et al., “Insights from the NeurIPS 2021 NetHack Challenge,” 2022.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather environments and challenges, I will document these references as they are relevant to the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format that includes the names of the environments and their corresponding citations, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the references as they appear in the paper.
