To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TrivialAugment: Tuning-free Yet State-of-the-Art Data Augmentation" by Samuel G. Müller and Frank Hutter, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments to study the performance of their method, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention that they evaluated their method on five different datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A standard dataset for image classification containing 50,000 training images.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, also containing 50,000 training images.
3. **SVHN**: A dataset consisting of images of house numbers, with a core set of 73,000 training images and an additional 531,000 simpler images.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale image classification dataset with over 1.2 million images and 1,000 classes.

The authors provide details about the datasets, including their sizes and characteristics, which confirms their relevance for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS’12), pages 1097–1105, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
