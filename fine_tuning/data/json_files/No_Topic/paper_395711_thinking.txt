To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composable Function-Preserving Expansions for Transformer Architectures" by Andrea Gesmundo and Kaitlin Maile, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the need for efficient training of neural networks but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on transformer architectures and their applications but still lacks explicit dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** and the **experiments section** (if present) for any mentions of datasets used in prior studies or experiments conducted by the authors. However, the provided text does not include an explicit experiments section, which may indicate that the authors did not use specific datasets for their evaluations.

Since the paper focuses on theoretical transformations and does not provide empirical results or datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers and do not explicitly mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were identified in the abstract, introduction, methodology, or related work sections.**
2. **The references do not include specific datasets.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper to accurately extract relevant information.
