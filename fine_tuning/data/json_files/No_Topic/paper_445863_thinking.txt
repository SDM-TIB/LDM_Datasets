To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PaSE: Parallelization Strategies for Efficient DNN Training" by Venmugil Elango, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the computational requirements for training deep neural networks (DNNs) and mentions evaluating the proposed strategies on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the author describes the benchmarks used for evaluation. In this section, the author mentions four different benchmarks:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is used for evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like AlexNet and InceptionV3. It is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.

2. **Billion-Word**: This dataset is utilized for the RNNLM (Recurrent Neural Network Language Model) benchmark. It is a large-scale dataset for measuring progress in statistical language modeling.

3. **WMT EN→DE**: This dataset is used for the Transformer model, specifically for machine translation tasks. It is part of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

4. **AlexNet** and **InceptionV3** are mentioned as models evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, but they are not datasets themselves.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009, pp. 248–255.

- For **Billion-Word**, the citation is:
  > C. Chelba, T. Mikolov, M. Schuster, Q. Ge, T. Brants, and P. Koehn. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. CoRR, vol. abs/1312.3005, 2013.

- For **WMT EN→DE**, the citation is:
  > Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. *Workshop on statistical machine translation*. [Online]. Available: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
