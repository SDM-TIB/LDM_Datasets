To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring Similarity: Computationally Reproducing the Scholar’s Interests" by Ashley Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or corpora used in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, which describes the process of measuring similarity between documents. Here, the authors mention the use of **Corpus 1** (the entire Hansard corpus) and **Corpus 2** (a subset of Hansard texts related to eviction and agrarian crisis). I will note the details about these corpora, including their sizes and the specific texts they encompass.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their analysis using these corpora. They mention the final corpus, **Corpus 3**, which is derived from the previous datasets. I will ensure to capture the characteristics of this corpus as well.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or corpora mentioned. The paper references several key texts that may provide authoritative citations for the datasets used.

The identified datasets and their descriptions are as follows:

1. **Corpus 1 (Hansard Corpus)**: This is the complete collection of Hansard debates from 1800 to 1910, consisting of 111,685 speeches and a quarter billion words. It serves as the baseline corpus for comparison.

2. **Corpus 2**: A subset of the Hansard corpus, containing 27,921 debates and 158 million words, specifically focused on topics related to eviction and agrarian crisis. This corpus is derived from a computer-aided search based on seed texts.

3. **Corpus 3**: The final corpus resulting from further winnowing of Corpus 2, which includes 1,396 debates and 5.19 million words. This corpus is refined through expert validation and similarity measures.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. 

- For **Hansard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hansard. *The Official Report of Debates in Parliament*. Various years, UK Parliament.

- For the methodology and validation references, I will include:
  > Tim Hitchcock, “Confronting the Digital: Or How Academic History Writing Lost the Plot,” *Cultural and Social History* 10, no. 1 (2013): 9–23.
  
  > Mohri, Rostamizadeh, and Talwalkar, *Foundations of Machine Learning* (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2012).

  > Cameron Blevins, “Topic Modeling Historical Sources: Analyzing the Diary of Martha Ballard,” *Proceedings of Digital Humanities* (2011).

  > Brigitte Bigi, “Using Kullback-Leibler Distance for Text Categorization,” in *European Conference on Information Retrieval* (Springer, 2003), 305–319, http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36618-0_22.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
