To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Generalizable Adversarial Attacks with Latent Variable Perturbation Modeling" by Avishek Joey Bose et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I will focus on the sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the framework and its applications across different domains, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will move on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets and Target Models)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **IMDB**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification. It contains 50,000 movie reviews, split into 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing. The reviews are labeled as either positive or negative, making it a standard benchmark for text classification tasks.

3. **Cora and CiteSeer**: These are two standard datasets for node classification in graph-structured data. Cora consists of 2,708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes, while CiteSeer contains 3,312 papers classified into six categories. Both datasets are widely used for evaluating graph neural networks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Indrajit Bhattacharya and Lise Getoor. *Collective entity resolution in relational data*. ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 1(1):5, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
