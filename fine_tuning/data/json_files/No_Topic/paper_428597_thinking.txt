To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMs as Compilers for Arabic Programming Language" by Serry Sibaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context of programming languages and compilers, but I need to look for any datasets related to the Arabic Programming Language (APL) or the methodologies used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the architecture of the compiler and prompt engineering. This section may contain references to datasets used for training or evaluating the models, especially if the authors discuss empirical results or experiments.

In the **related work section**, the authors mention various programming languages and compilers, but I need to check if they cite any datasets that were used in previous studies or that are relevant to their work. This could provide context or benchmarks that they are comparing against.

I will also examine the **figures and examples** provided in the paper, as they may reference datasets indirectly through the examples of code or applications of the APL. If any datasets are used in the illustrations or examples, I will note them down.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If I identify any datasets, I will ensure to document them with their full citations, including authors, titles, publication venues, and any relevant details that describe the dataset's purpose and content.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets along with their citations for easy reference.
