To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Hashing via Householder Quantization" by Lucas R. Schwengber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors provide extensive experimental results on widely used image datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CIFAR 10**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 images divided into 10 mutually exclusive classes. The authors mention that they take 500 images per class for training, 100 images per class for testing and validation, and the remaining images are used as database images.

2. **NUS WIDE**: This dataset consists of 269,648 images from flickr.com, with annotations from a set of 81 possible concepts. The authors detail their process of reducing the dataset to 148,332 images and how they sample images for training and validation.

3. **MS COCO**: This dataset is for image segmentation and captioning, containing 123,287 images. The authors specify how they sample images for training, validation, and database purposes.

4. **ImageNet**: A large dataset with over 1,200,000 images in the training set and 50,000 in the validation set. The authors describe how they select a subset of categories and split the dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR 10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **NUS WIDE**, the citation is:
  > T.-S. Chua, J. Tang, R. Hong, H. Li, Z. Luo, and Y. Zheng. *NUS-WIDE: A Real-World Web Image Database from National University of Singapore*. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval, 2009.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014, 2014.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
