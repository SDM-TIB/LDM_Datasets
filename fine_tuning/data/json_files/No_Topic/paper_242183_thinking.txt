To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIT-VO: Visual Odometry at 300 FPS using Binary Features from the Focal Plane" by Riku Murai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a motion capture system for evaluation, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They state that they evaluated their system against ground-truth data from the **Vicon motion capture system**. This indicates that the Vicon system is a dataset used for comparison.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **background and methodology sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Vicon motion capture system, as it is explicitly referenced in the context of performance evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Vicon motion capture system. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Vicon system, I will note that it is a widely recognized system in the field of motion capture, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation as it is not included in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Vicon Motion Capture System**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the BIT-VO system against ground-truth data. It is a well-known system in the field of motion capture, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into the required format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the datasets used in the research and their significance in the evaluation of the proposed method.
