To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Reflection Removal Using Deep Encoder-Decoder Network" by Zhixiang Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the synthesis of a large number of photo-realistic reflection-tainted images from reflection-free images collected online, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Preparation of Training Data)**, where the authors describe how they collected and prepared the training images. They mention using images from two specific datasets:

1. **Indoor Scene Recognition Dataset**: The authors state that they collected 2303 images from this dataset to simulate scenarios where reflections interfere with image formation.

2. **Street Snap Images**: They also mention collecting 2622 street snap images from online sources, which are used as reflection images.

In **section 5.1 (Data Preparation)**, the authors provide further details about how these datasets were utilized to synthesize training images. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **Indoor Scene Recognition Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quattoni, A., & Torralba, A. (2009). Recognizing indoor scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 413â€“420.

- For the **Street Snap Images**, the authors reference a specific online collection:
  > Jokinen, L., & Sampo, K. (2017). Hel looks. Retrieved from https://www.hel-looks.com/. [Online; accessed 19-Oct-2017].

With these citations, I have now identified the datasets used in the paper and their respective references. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
