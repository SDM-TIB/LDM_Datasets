To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SylNet: An Adaptable End-to-End Syllable Count Estimator for Speech" by Shreyas Seshadri and Okko Räsänen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of syllable count estimation in various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the need for robust language-independent methods and mention previous studies that utilized specific datasets. However, I need to find the exact datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention two large speech corpora for initial training:

1. **Phonetic Corpus of Estonian Spontaneous Speech (EstPhon)**: This corpus includes spontaneous Estonian dialogues totaling up to 10,158 utterances and 5.2 hours of audio.

2. **Korean Corpus of Spontaneous Speech**: This corpus consists of conversational dialogues, and for their experiments, a subset of 12,000 utterances (5.0 hours) was used.

Additionally, they mention three other corpora used for testing and adaptation:

1. **FinDialogue Corpus of Spontaneous Finnish Speech**: This corpus includes dialogues from 4 talkers, totaling 64 minutes of speech.

2. **C-PROM Corpus of Spoken French**: This corpus consists of 24 multi-minute recordings from various regional varieties of French, totaling 1.2 hours of data.

3. **Switchboard Corpus of Spontaneous American English Telephone Conversations (SWB)**: This corpus uses a syllable-annotated subset with hundreds of talkers, totaling 159 minutes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Phonetic Corpus of Estonian Spontaneous Speech (EstPhon)**, the citation is:

- For the **C-PROM Corpus of Spoken French**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
