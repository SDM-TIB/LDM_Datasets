To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Adversarial Examples Through Deep Neural Networkâ€™s Response Surface and Uncertainty Regions" by Juan Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on deep neural networks (DNNs) and adversarial examples, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 2) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit classification, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. The authors state that MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with 28x28 gray-scale pixels.

Additionally, they refer to the **CIFAR10 dataset** in Section 2.3, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This dataset is also widely recognized in the field of computer vision.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their methodology for generating adversarial examples using various attack algorithms on these datasets. They provide specific results and misclassification rates for the models trained on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (last accessed on Dec. 07, 2020).

2. For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. University of Toronto, 05 2012.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale.
- **CIFAR10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
