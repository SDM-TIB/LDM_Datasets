To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing data-limited assessments: Optimal utilization of fishery-dependent data through random effects â€” A case study on Korea chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus)" by Kyuhan Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of fisheries management and the reliance on fishery-dependent data, specifically mentioning **catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data**. This indicates that datasets related to CPUE are likely included in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly **section 2.2 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CPUE Data**: Collected from 1976 to 2019, this dataset is crucial for understanding the fishing effort and stock assessment. However, it is noted that this data is not publicly available.

2. **Length Composition Data**: This dataset spans from 2000 to 2017 and is used to analyze the size distribution of the catch. Similar to the CPUE data, it is also not publicly available.

3. **Annual Catch Data**: This dataset includes catch data in weight from 1950 to 2021, sourced from Statistics Korea and the FishStatJ database. This dataset is publicly available and provides a historical perspective on the fishery.

In the **results section**, the authors may reference these datasets again to discuss their findings, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference previous studies and data sources, which may provide the necessary citations for the datasets.

For the **CPUE Data**, since it is not publicly available, I will note that it was obtained from earlier studies by Kim et al. (2018), Jung (2019), and Gim (2019). However, I will not be able to provide a full citation for this dataset.

For the **Length Composition Data**, similar to the CPUE data, it is referenced from Kim et al. (2018), Jung (2019), and Gim (2019), and I will note that it is not publicly available.

For the **Annual Catch Data**, I will provide the following citations:
- Statistics Korea. (1976 to 2021). Annual catch data.
- Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). FishStatJ database (1950 to 1975).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for clarity.

1. **CPUE Data**: Collected from 1976 to 2019, used for stock assessment. Not publicly available. Cited from earlier studies (Kim et al., 2018; Jung, 2019; Gim, 2019).

2. **Length Composition Data**: Spanning from 2000 to 2017, used to analyze size distribution. Not publicly available. Cited from earlier studies (Kim et al., 2018; Jung, 2019; Gim, 2019).

3. **Annual Catch Data**: Includes catch data in weight from 1950 to 2021. 
   - Statistics Korea. Annual catch data (1976 to 2021).
   - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). FishStatJ database (1950 to 1975).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset descriptions and citations are clear and accurate for future reference or analysis.
