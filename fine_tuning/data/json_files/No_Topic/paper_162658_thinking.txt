To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neuronal Planar Modeling for Handwriting Signature based on Automatic Segmentation" by I. Abroug Ben Abdelghani and N. Essoukri Ben Amara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method has been tested on two databases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimentations and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Database description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two databases:

1. **Database 1**: This is a proprietary dataset collected by the authors, containing 3600 genuine signatures from 60 individuals, along with 2400 forged signatures produced by 10 forgers. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **GPDS-300 Database**: This is a public dataset that includes 300 individuals, with 24 genuine signatures and 30 forgeries for each individual. This dataset is also significant for validating their proposed method.

Now, I will ensure to gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The GPDS-300 database citation is provided in the references as follows:

- For **GPDS-300 Database**, the citation is:
  > F. Vargas, M. A. Ferrer, C. M. Travieso, J. B. Alonso. "Off-line Handwritten Signature GPDS-960 Corpus". In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 764-768, 2007.

The proprietary dataset does not have a formal citation since it is collected by the authors themselves, but I will note its details for completeness.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation for the GPDS-300 database is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
