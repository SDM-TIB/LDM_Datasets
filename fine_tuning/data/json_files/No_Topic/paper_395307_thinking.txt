To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Analysis of the wav2vec 2.0 Feature Extractor" by Peter Vieting et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **LibriSpeech benchmark**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **LibriSpeech corpus**. This section provides details about the dataset, including its size (960 hours of read English speech) and the specific subsets used for evaluation (dev-clean, dev-other, test-clean, and test-other).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech corpus**. The citation provided in the references is:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, Apr. 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **LibriSpeech corpus** as the dataset used for experiments, I will not need to look for additional datasets in this case.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the **LibriSpeech corpus** with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any required structured output or further processing.
