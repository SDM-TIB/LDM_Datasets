To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoDS: Towards Human-Centered Automation of Data Science" by Dakuo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Design)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I need to gather more details about it.

In this section, the authors specify that the UCI Heart Disease dataset contains 303 patients' medical records and 13 features, which is essential information for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Blake, C. L., & Merz, C. J. (1998). UCI repository of machine learning databases. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will ensure that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in my final output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research, adhering to the importance of proper citation.
