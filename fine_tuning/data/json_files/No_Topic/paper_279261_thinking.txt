To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vulnerability Forecasting: In theory and practice" by Ã‰ireann Leverett, Matilda Rhode, and Adam Wedgbury, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses predicting the volume of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and mentions the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) as a key resource. This indicates that the NVD is likely a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **data used section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their research. Here, they mention two primary sources:

1. **National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)**: This dataset contains detailed information about CVEs, including publication dates, organizations reporting the CVEs, and descriptions. The NVD is crucial for their predictive modeling.

2. **MITRE CVE Data**: The authors also reference data from MITRE, which maintains the CVE list. This dataset provides additional granularity regarding the assigned dates of CVEs, which is essential for their forecasting models.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations related to these datasets. The NVD is a well-known public resource, so I will note its official website as the citation. For the MITRE data, I will also reference its official site.

The citations I will compile are:

- For the **National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)**:
  > National Institute of Standards and Technology. *National Vulnerability Database*. [https://nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov).

- For the **MITRE CVE Data**:
  > MITRE Corporation. *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)*. [https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
