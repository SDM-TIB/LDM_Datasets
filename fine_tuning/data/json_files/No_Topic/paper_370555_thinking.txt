To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Multidimensional Clusters With Support Lines" by Nuno Fachada and Diogo de Andrade, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the importance of synthetic data for assessing clustering techniques, which suggests that the paper may introduce or reference specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the Clugen algorithm. This section is likely to contain details about the datasets generated using Clugen, including any parameters or characteristics that define these datasets.

I will also look for a **results section** or any **experiments** conducted using the datasets. This part of the paper may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized and any specific datasets that were generated or referenced.

In the **discussion section**, the authors might reflect on the implications of the datasets generated, which could provide additional context or highlight specific datasets of interest.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the primary dataset is the synthetic data generated by the Clugen algorithm. I will note the following details:

1. **Clugen Synthetic Dataset**: The paper describes the Clugen algorithm, which generates multidimensional clusters supported by line segments. The dataset characteristics include the number of dimensions, clusters, points, and the statistical distributions used for generation.

Next, I will compile the full citation for the Clugen algorithm as it is the primary focus of the dataset generation:

- For the Clugen algorithm, the citation is:
  > Nuno Fachada and Diogo de Andrade. *Generating Multidimensional Clusters With Support Lines*. Lus√≥fona University, COPELABS, Lisbon, Portugal, 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
