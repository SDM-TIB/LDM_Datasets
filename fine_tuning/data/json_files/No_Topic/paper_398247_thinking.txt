To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CIEM: Contrastive Instruction Evaluation Method for Better Instruction Tuning" by Hongyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of an "annotated image-text dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is involved, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the limitations of existing methods and the need for a dataset that can evaluate hallucination in vision-language models. However, they do not specify a dataset in this section.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the Contrastive Instruction Evaluation Method (CIEM) and mention that it leverages "annotated image-text datasets." They also refer to using the COCO dataset for generating question-answer pairs, which is a significant dataset in the context of their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experiments using the COCO Caption dataset, which is used to evaluate the visual hallucination problem of vision-language models. They mention generating a large number of factual and contrastive question-answer pairs from this dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755, Springer, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
