To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Soft Labels to Model Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation" by João Lourenço Silva and Arlindo L. Oliveira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on datasets from the **MICCAI 2021 QUBIQ challenge**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Data Augmentation)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they list several datasets along with their modalities, tasks, number of annotators, and sizes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Brain Growth**: A 2D MRI dataset with 34 cases and 7 annotators.
2. **Brain Tumor 1**: A 2D MRI dataset with 28 cases and 3 annotators.
3. **Brain Tumor 2**: A 2D MRI dataset with 20 cases and 3 annotators.
4. **Brain Tumor 3**: A 2D MRI dataset with 48 cases and 2 annotators.
5. **Kidney**: A 2D CT dataset with 20 cases and 1 annotator.
6. **Prostate 1**: A 2D MRI dataset with 34 cases and 1 annotator.
7. **Prostate 2**: A 2D MRI dataset with 28 cases and 1 annotator.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used from the MICCAI 2021 QUBIQ challenge. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are part of a challenge and may need to be referenced accordingly.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the relevant details such as modality, tasks, annotators, and sizes, while also noting the challenge context for citation purposes.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset.
