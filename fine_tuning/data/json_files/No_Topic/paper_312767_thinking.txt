To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-induced network bursts and coherence in a calcium-mediated neural network" by Na Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on noise-induced bursting in neural networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the dynamics of bursting and coherence in neural networks but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods and results sections**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for simulations or analyses. The authors describe a mathematical model and the parameters used for simulations, but they do not reference any external datasets or benchmarks.

Since the paper appears to focus on a theoretical model rather than empirical data derived from existing datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature. However, the references primarily consist of studies related to neural dynamics and coherence resonance, without specific datasets mentioned.

After reviewing the entire paper, it seems that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their research. Instead, they constructed a mathematical model and performed simulations based on theoretical parameters. Therefore, there are no datasets to extract or cite in this case.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses important concepts in neural network dynamics, it does not provide any datasets for extraction or citation.
