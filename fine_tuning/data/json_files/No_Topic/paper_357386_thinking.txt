To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding NEEMo: Geometric Fitting using Neural Estimation of the Energy Mover’s Distance" by Ouail Kitouni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction often contains more detailed context about the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Energy Mover’s Distance (EMD) and its applications in high-energy particle physics, but they do not mention specific datasets at this point. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. The authors mention using synthetic data for their experiments, specifically noting that they generated jets with varying numbers of subjet centers and particles. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation for these synthetic datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses synthetic data generated for the experiments, I will note that while there are no publicly available datasets cited, the authors have created their own datasets for the purpose of their study. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any datasets referenced that might be relevant to the experiments. The references primarily cite previous works related to the theoretical foundations and methodologies used in the paper, but they do not mention any specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide formal datasets with citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, specifically for clustering algorithms in high-energy particle physics. However, these datasets do not have formal citations as they are not publicly available datasets.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations to extract, I will conclude my extraction process here. If there were specific datasets mentioned with citations, I would ensure to document each one with its full citation for clarity and reference.
