To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Human-grounded Evaluations of Explanation Methods for Text Classification" by Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn and Francesca Toni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations using datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Amazon Review Polarity**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of positive and negative classes. The authors mention that they randomly selected 100K, 50K, and 100K examples for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

2. **ArXiv Abstract**: This dataset is created by collecting abstracts from scientific articles available on ArXiv, specifically from the "Computer Science", "Mathematics", and "Physics" categories. The authors state that they randomly selected 6K, 1.5K, and 10K examples for training, validation, and testing, respectively.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Amazon Review Polarity dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Volume 1, NIPS’15, pages 649–657, Cambridge, MA, USA. MIT Press, 2015.

- For the **ArXiv Abstract dataset**, since it is created by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but can be referenced as:
  > Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn and Francesca Toni. *ArXiv Abstract Dataset*. Unpublished dataset created for the paper.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
