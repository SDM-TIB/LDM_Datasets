To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Geometric Multiscale Approximations for Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data" by Wenjing Liao and Mauro Maggioni, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections for any mentions of datasets. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. This could include sections explicitly titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically contain comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the identified sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, dimensions, and specific applications or tasks for which they were used. 

4. **Check the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
