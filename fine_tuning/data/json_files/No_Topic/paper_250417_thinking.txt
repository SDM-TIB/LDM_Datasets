To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Distinct Representation Learning for Action Recognition" by Junwu Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Something-Something V1**: This dataset is described as a crowd-sourced dataset focusing on temporal modeling, containing 108,499 videos across 174 action categories.

2. **Something-Something V2**: Similar to V1, this dataset includes 220,847 videos and also focuses on temporal modeling with the same number of action categories.

3. **Kinetics400**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 400 human action classes, with at least 400 video clips for each category, and an average duration of around 10 seconds per clip.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Something-Something V1**:
  > Goyal, R., Kahou, S.E., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fruend, I., Yianilos, P., Mueller-Freitag, M., et al. *The "Something Something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), vol. 1, p. 5, 2017.

- For **Something-Something V2**:
  > Goyal, R., Kahou, S.E., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fruend, I., Yianilos, P., Mueller-Freitag, M., et al. *The "Something Something V2" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **Kinetics400**:
  > Carreira, J., Zisserman, A. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the Kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6299â€“6308, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
