To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Matching by Weakly Supervised 2D Point Set Registration" by Zakaria Laskar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed approach is trained and tested on a standard benchmark dataset called **Proposal-Flow (PF-PASCAL)**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the PF-PASCAL dataset. They describe it as consisting of 1400 image pairs selected from the PASCAL-VOC dataset, annotated with corresponding key-point locations. The authors also mention the training, validation, and test splits of the dataset, which further confirms its significance in their experiments.

In addition to PF-PASCAL, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors discuss generating additional training samples using category-level information, but they do not introduce any new datasets apart from PF-PASCAL.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PF-PASCAL dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the PF-PASCAL dataset is:
> B. Ham, M. Cho, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Proposal Flow*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for PF-PASCAL, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:
1. **PF-PASCAL Dataset**: A benchmark dataset consisting of 1400 image pairs from PASCAL-VOC, annotated with key-point locations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and includes all necessary details for future reference or processing.
