To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Waves: Defining the lead time of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19" by Scott W. Olesen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and its applications in monitoring COVID-19, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to wastewater measurements.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In the **results section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or present data derived from them. For example, Table 1 in the paper lists studies that made quantitative estimates of lead times for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, which indicates that these studies may represent datasets relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the original sources.

For instance, if I find that the paper references the **National Wastewater Surveillance System**, I will look for its citation in the references section. Similarly, if the paper discusses specific studies that utilized wastewater data, I will extract their citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are comprehensive and accurately reflect the information provided in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
