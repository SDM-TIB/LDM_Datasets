To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pricing without no-arbitrage condition in discrete time" by Laurence Carassus and Emmanuel LÃ©pinette, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the research, including any datasets used. I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources that are critical to the research.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, results, or any empirical analysis. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize dataset information.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to extract specific details. This section may provide comprehensive information about each dataset, including its purpose, how it was collected, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title of the work, publication details, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
