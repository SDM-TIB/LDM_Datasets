To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary Ensemble Learning for Multivariate Time Series Prediction" by Hui Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on two real-world applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Electricity Data Set**: This dataset includes historical electricity data collected from smart meters in buildings at RMIT University, along with environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities Data Set**: This dataset contains PM2.5 concentration data along with other environmental variables from five different cities in China. The authors also provide a link to this dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Electricity Data Set**, the citation is:
  > Hui Song, A. K. Qin, and F. D. Salim. "Multivariate electricity consumption prediction with extreme learning machine." In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2016, pp. 2313–2320. Available at: https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-values/sustainability/sustainable-urban-precincts-program

- For the **PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities Data Set**, the citation is:
  > X. Liang, S. Li, S. Zhang, H. Huang, and S. X. Chen. "PM 2.5 data reliability, consistency, and air quality assessment in five Chinese cities." Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, vol. 121, no. 17, pp. 1–17, 2016. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PM2.5+Data+of+Five+Chinese+Cities

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
