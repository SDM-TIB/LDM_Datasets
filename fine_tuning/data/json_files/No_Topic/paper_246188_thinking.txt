To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Active Inference Agents Using Monte-Carlo Methods" by Zafeirios Fountas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors illustrate their approach in a new toy environment based on the **dSprites dataset**. This suggests that the dSprites dataset is one of the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find more details about the datasets. In Section 4.1, the authors mention using the **dSprites dataset** for a simple 2D environment and the **Animal-AI environment** for a more complex task. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **dSprites Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Loic Matthey, Irina Higgins, Demis Hassabis, and Alexander Lerchner. *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/, 2017.

2. **Animal-AI Environment**: The citation is:
   > Matthew Crosby, Benjamin Beyret, and Marta Halina. *The Animal-AI Olympics*. Nature Machine Intelligence, 1(5):257â€“257, 2019.

With these citations, I have now gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
