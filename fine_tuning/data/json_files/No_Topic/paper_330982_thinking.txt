To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Single Neuron for Non-monotonic Activation Functions" by Lei Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, types of data, etc.).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it is likely to provide comprehensive details about each dataset used in the study. I will note down the names, descriptions, and any other relevant information provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I will look for the original paper that introduced this dataset and note its citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check for a dedicated datasets section for comprehensive information.
4. Look up full citations in the references section for each dataset mentioned.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
