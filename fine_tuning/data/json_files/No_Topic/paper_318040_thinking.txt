To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Methods and Metrics for the Assessment of Explainability under the Proposed AI Act" by Francesco Sovrano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses the interplay between metrics and the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of existing literature on explainability metrics. This section cites several surveys and papers, but again, it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **methodology section** to determine if the authors describe any datasets used for their exploratory literature review. This section mentions collecting papers and performing keyword-based research, but it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **results and discussion sections**, I will check for any mention of datasets used in the analysis of explainability metrics. However, the focus here is primarily on qualitative analysis and theoretical frameworks rather than empirical datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. The references list several papers, but they primarily focus on methodologies and metrics rather than datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on theoretical discussions and existing literature rather than empirical data collection.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. My conclusion is that this paper does not include any datasets relevant to the study of explainability metrics in AI systems.
