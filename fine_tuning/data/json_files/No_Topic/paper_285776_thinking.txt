To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Retrospective Cost Adaptive Control for Flight Control Applications" by Syed Aseem Ul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, and any datasets used for experiments or evaluations are likely mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the datasets used. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were collected or generated.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Flight Dynamics Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or repository where it can be accessed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
