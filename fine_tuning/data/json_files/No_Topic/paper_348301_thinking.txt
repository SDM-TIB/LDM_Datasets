To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Optimal Transport Between two Empirical Distributions with Normalizing Flows" by Florentin Coeurdoux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of empirical distributions and optimal transport, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and may mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the nature of the data used.

In the **numerical experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors mention using synthetic data for toy examples and word embeddings for the unsupervised word translation task. I will note these as datasets, even if they are not traditional datasets, since they are crucial for the experiments conducted.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: Used in the toy examples for testing the proposed method. While not a formal dataset, it is essential for the experiments.
2. **Word Embeddings**: The authors mention using FastText embeddings trained on Wikipedia corpora for the unsupervised word translation task. This is another critical dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FastText embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., & Mikolov, T. (2017). Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the synthetic data does not have a formal citation, I will note it as a dataset used in the experiments without a specific reference.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
