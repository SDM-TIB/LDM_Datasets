To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smart Black Box 2.0: Efficient High-bandwidth Driving Data Collection based on Video Anomalies" by Ryan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that a video dataset was constructed to evaluate the Smart Black Box (SBB) on real-world data, which suggests that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for high-bandwidth data collection for autonomous vehicles. They mention existing datasets like BDD100K and DoTA, which are relevant to their work. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they combined the BDD100K dataset with the DoTA dataset to create a new dataset for their experiments. They specify that they used 10,000 validation videos from BDD100K and 500 anomalous video clips from DoTA, resulting in a combined dataset with approximately 4,000,000 frames.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BDD100K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yu, F., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Liao, M., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2018). BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation Tooling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687.

2. **DoTA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yao, Y., Wang, X., Xu, M., Pu, Z., Atkins, E., & Crandall, D. (2020). When, Where, and What? A New Dataset for Anomaly Detection in Driving Videos. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.03044.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
