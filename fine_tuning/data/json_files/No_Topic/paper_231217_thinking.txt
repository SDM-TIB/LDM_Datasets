To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prosody Transfer in Neural Text to Speech Using Global Pitch and Loudness Features" by Siddharth Gururani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the need for expressive text-to-speech systems but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe their proprietary dataset. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of approximately 10 hours of professionally recorded, female, single-speaker expressive speech in English, with around 10,000 (text, utterance) pairs. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note its details.

The authors also mention that they set aside 100 utterances for validation and 100 for testing, but they do not provide a specific name for their proprietary dataset. Therefore, I will refer to it as the "Proprietary Expressive Speech Dataset" for the purpose of this extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets used in the experiments. However, since the authors only describe their proprietary dataset without citing any external datasets, I will not find additional citations here.

The full citation for the proprietary dataset, based on the information provided in the paper, will be:
> Gururani, S., Gupta, K., Shah, D., Shakeri, Z., & Pinto, J. (2023). *Prosody Transfer in Neural Text to Speech Using Global Pitch and Loudness Features*. Georgia Institute of Technology and Electronic Arts.

Since there are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format for review or downstream processing.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Proprietary Expressive Speech Dataset**: Contains approximately 10 hours of expressive speech with 10,000 (text, utterance) pairs.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure.
