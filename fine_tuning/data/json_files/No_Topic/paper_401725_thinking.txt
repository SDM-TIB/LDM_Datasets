To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pushing Large Language Models to the 6G Edge: Vision, Challenges, and Opportunities" by Zheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, Google’s PALM, and Meta’s LLaMA, but they do not specify datasets here. I will need to check later sections for any datasets used in their discussions or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **sections discussing applications (Section II)** and **challenges (Section III)**. Here, the authors mention the use of medical datasets for training LLMs like Google’s Med-PaLM 2, which is fine-tuned on medical datasets. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

In **Section V (Efficient Large Model Training at the Edge)**, the authors discuss techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning and mention the use of datasets for training LLMs, but again, they do not specify which datasets are used.

I will also check the **References section** for any papers that might detail datasets used in the context of LLMs. The references include various papers that may have datasets associated with them, such as:

- For **Med-PaLM 2**, the citation is:

- For **GPT-3**, the citation is:

- For **PALM**, the citation is:

- For **LoRA**, the citation is:
  > Hu, E. J., Shen, Y., Wallis, P., Allen-Zhu, Z., Li, Y., Wang, S., Wang, L., & Chen, W. (2021). LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09685.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that while specific datasets are not named, the authors reference several models and techniques that are associated with datasets in the literature. I will compile the relevant citations for the models mentioned, as they are tied to the datasets used for training.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or model referenced in the paper.
