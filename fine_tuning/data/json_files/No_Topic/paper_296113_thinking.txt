To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Admission Control in 5G Wireless Networks" by Youri Raaijmakers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses simulation experiments but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about the admission control problem but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation setup section** (Section III), where the authors describe the simulation environment. Here, they mention that the simulation reproduces the downlink channel between active base stations and user equipment (UE) according to the 3D Urban Macro (3D-UMa) scenario defined by 3GPP. This indicates that the authors are using a specific simulation model rather than a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** (Section IV) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the simulation results. However, the authors primarily discuss the performance of various admission control policies without referencing any external datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of technical reports and papers related to 5G standards and admission control techniques, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for datasets used in the experiments, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper, and I will ensure to note that the authors relied on simulation models rather than external datasets for their experiments. This will be important for anyone looking to replicate or build upon the research.
