To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Follow the Compressed Leader: Faster Online Learning of Eigenvectors and Faster MMWU" by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset mentions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors usually describe the experiments conducted. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide key details.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss experiments or evaluations, as these are likely to reference specific datasets. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, features).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or analysis that may be required.
