To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cuckoo Search: State-of-the-Art and Opportunities" by Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or discussed. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may give insights into the applications of cuckoo search, which could lead to the identification of datasets used in those applications.

Next, I will examine the **applications section** (Section 3) closely, as it lists various applications of the cuckoo search algorithm across different domains. Each application may reference specific datasets used for experimentation or validation. I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or provide additional context about their usage in the experiments. If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the paper references the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
