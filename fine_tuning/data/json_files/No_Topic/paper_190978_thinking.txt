To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Estimation of the Multifractality Parameter for Image Texture Using a Whittle Approximation" by S. Combrexelle et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of estimating multifractal parameters for image textures, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction provides context about multifractal analysis but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments. If they mention specific datasets or provide details about the data they analyzed, I will take note of them.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used to validate their findings. If the authors discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets, I will document those.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain this information.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

Throughout this process, I will ensure that I accurately capture the names and details of any datasets mentioned, as well as their corresponding citations, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in the study.
