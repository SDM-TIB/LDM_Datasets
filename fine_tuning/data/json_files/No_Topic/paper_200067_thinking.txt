To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syllabification by Phone Categorization" by Jacob Krantz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel approach to syllabification and mentions training and testing on English words, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **method** section, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing. In this case, the authors mention using the **CELEX2 lexical dataset** for training the hidden Markov model (HMM). This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

I will then check the **results and discussion** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are any clarifications about the dataset used. The authors do not introduce any new datasets here, but they do provide insights into the performance of their model based on the dataset used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the CELEX2 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **CELEX2**: Baayen, R., Piepenbrock, R., & Gulikers, L. (1995). *CELEX2 LDC96L14*. Web Download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Investigate the method section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Check the results and discussion for any additional insights.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
