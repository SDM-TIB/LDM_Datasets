To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Attack on Deep Product Quantization Network for Image Retrieval" by Yan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Datasets and Metrics** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors specify that the training set consists of 50,000 images, while the test set is divided into 9,000 images for the database and 1,000 images for queries.

2. **NUS-WIDE**: This dataset is noted for its large scale, containing 269,648 images, each associated with one or more labels related to 81 concepts. The authors mention using a subset of 186,577 images corresponding to the 10 most popular concepts, with a standard training and test set separation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., and Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:
  > Chua, T., Tang, J., Hong, R., Li, H., Luo, Z., and Zheng, Y. (2009). NUS-WIDE: A real-world web image database from National University of Singapore. In CIVR.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
