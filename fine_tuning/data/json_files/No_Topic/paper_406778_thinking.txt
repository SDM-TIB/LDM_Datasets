To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed multi-UAV shield formation based on virtual surface constraints" by Mar√≠a Guinaldo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental data used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they validate their approach over an experimental platform of micro-aerial vehicles, and they refer to a previous work for the description of this platform. I will check the reference they provide to see if it includes any datasets or experimental setups that are relevant.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in their experiments, I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:

- If they mention a dataset related to UAVs, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset and provide the citation in the appropriate format.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
