To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Deep Learning and Reasoning for Address Detection in Unstructured Text Documents" by Matthias Engelbach et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for automatic detection of addresses in unstructured documents, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly for training and evaluation purposes.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors describe their test data. They mention building a test set consisting of **64 scanned documents** with a total of **104 pages**. This indicates that the authors have created a dataset specifically for evaluating their address extraction approach.

I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets used in their methodology. The authors mention the **RVL-CDIP dataset** as a foundational model for transfer learning, which is relevant to their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Test Dataset**: The authors created a custom test dataset consisting of scanned documents for their experiments. Since this dataset is not publicly available, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

2. **RVL-CDIP Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Harley, A. W., Ufkes, A., & Derpanis, K. G. (2015). Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Nets for Document Image Classification and Retrieval. In International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document them clearly, including the context in which they were used in the paper. The custom test dataset is crucial for understanding the evaluation of the proposed method, while the RVL-CDIP dataset provides context for the foundational models used in their approach.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
