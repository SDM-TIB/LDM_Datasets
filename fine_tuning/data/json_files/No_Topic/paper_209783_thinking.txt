To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUMNET: Fully Convolutional Model for Fast Segmentation of Anatomical Structures in Ultrasound Volumes" by Sumanth Nandamuri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on publicly available datasets consisting of **10 intravascular ultrasound pullbacks** and **16 freehand thyroid ultrasound volumes**. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context about the challenges of ultrasound imaging and the need for segmentation methods. While this section may not explicitly name datasets, it reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

In **section 4 (Experiments, Results, and Discussions)**, the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Dataset**: This dataset consists of **10 pullbacks** acquired at **20 MHz** from the 2011 MICCAI workshop. The authors compare their method against various approaches using this dataset.

2. **Thyroid Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset includes **16 freehand acquired thyroid ultrasound volumes** from healthy human subjects, imaged with a **11-16 MHz probe**. The authors reference a publicly available dataset for this.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IVUS dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Balocco, C. Gatta, F. Ciompi, A. Wahle, P. Radeva, S. Carlier, G. Unal, E. Sanidas, J. Mauri, X. Carillo, et al. "Standardized evaluation methodology and reference database for evaluating IVUS image segmentation." *Comput. Med. Imaging Graph.*, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 70â€“90, 2014.

- For the **Thyroid dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Wunderling, B. Golla, P. Poudel, C. Arens, M. Friebe, and C. Hansen. "Comparison of thyroid segmentation techniques for 3D ultrasound." In *Proc. Med. Imaging Image Process.*, 2017, vol. 10133, p. 1013317.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
