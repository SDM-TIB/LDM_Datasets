To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions" by Andrej Karpathy and Li Fei-Fei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model evaluates performance on several datasets, specifically **Flickr8K**, **Flickr30K**, and **MSCOCO**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. In Section 4, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some context about each:

1. **Flickr8K**: This dataset contains 8,000 images, each annotated with 5 sentences. It is used for training and validation purposes.
2. **Flickr30K**: This dataset consists of 31,000 images, also annotated with 5 sentences each. Similar to Flickr8K, it is used for training and validation.
3. **MSCOCO**: This dataset includes 123,000 images, with each image annotated with 5 sentences. The authors specify that they use 5,000 images for validation and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Flickr8K**:
  > Hodosh, M., Young, P., & Hockenmaier, J. (2013). Framing image description as a ranking task: data, models and evaluation metrics. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 2013.

- For **Flickr30K**:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2014.

- For **MSCOCO**:
  > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.-Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
