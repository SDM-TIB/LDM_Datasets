To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CulturalTeaming: AI-Assisted Interactive Red-Teaming for Challenging LLMs’ (Lack of) Multicultural Knowledge" by Yu Ying Chiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **CULTURALBENCH-V0.1**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2.4 (CULTURALBENCH-V0.1: A Compact Dataset for LLMs’ Multicultural Knowledge)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe it as containing **252 carefully-reviewed multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** spanning **34 distinct cultures**. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they evaluated various LLMs using the CULTURALBENCH-V0.1 dataset, confirming its significance in the research. This reinforces that CULTURALBENCH-V0.1 is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CULTURALBENCH-V0.1 dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is available on Hugging Face, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, and where it can be accessed.

The citation for the CULTURALBENCH-V0.1 dataset is:
> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Maria Antoniak, Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Mehar Bhatia, Sahithya Ravi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Vered Shwartz, Yejin Choi. *CULTURALBENCH-V0.1: A Compact Dataset for LLMs’ Multicultural Knowledge*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kellycyy/CulturalBench.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify key datasets.
2. Review the methodology and results sections for detailed descriptions of the datasets.
3. Check the references for full citations.
4. Document the dataset with the necessary citation for future use.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
