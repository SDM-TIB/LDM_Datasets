To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Relation Extraction via Reading Comprehension" by Omer Levy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a large dataset for training relation-extraction models, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention using the **WikiReading dataset** to gather labeled examples for relation-slot filling. This dataset is crucial for understanding their approach, so I will note its details.

In this section, the authors explain that the WikiReading dataset was created by aligning Wikidata relations with corresponding Wikipedia articles. This dataset is significant as it provides the foundation for their reading-comprehension examples.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss the process of schema querification and crowdsourcing to generate a large reading-comprehension dataset, but they primarily focus on the WikiReading dataset as the source of their labeled examples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiReading dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Daniel Hewlett, Alexandre Lacoste, Llion Jones, Illia Polosukhin, Andrew Fandrianto, Jay Han, Matthew Kelcey, and David Berthelot. *Wikireading: A novel large-scale language understanding task over Wikipedia*. In Proceedings of the Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WikiReading dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WikiReading dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future use or analysis.
