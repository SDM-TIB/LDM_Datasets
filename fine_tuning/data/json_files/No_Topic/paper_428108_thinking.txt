To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Large to Tiny: Distilling and Refining Mathematical Expertise for Math Word Problems with Weakly Supervision" by Qingwen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of two datasets, **Math23K** and **Weak12K**, which are crucial for evaluating the proposed method. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed further in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They describe **Math23K** as containing 23,161 math word problems annotated with solution expressions and answers, and **Weak12K** as a Chinese weakly supervised dataset with 12,117 math word problems, created without reference full-supervised equations. This section provides essential details about the datasets, confirming their relevance to the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **Math23K**, the citation is:
> Wang, Y., Liu, X., and Shi, S. "Deep neural solver for math word problems." In Proceedings of the 2017 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pp. 845–854, 2017.

For **Weak12K**, the citation is:
> Liang, Z., Zhang, J., Wang, L., Wang, Y., Shao, J., and Zhang, X. "Generalizing math word problem solvers via solution diversification." In Proceedings of the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI, pp. 7–14, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
