To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy Graph Searching for Vascular Tracking in Angiographic Image Sequences" by Huihui Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **Datasets and Evaluation Metrics**. Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Single Branch Dataset (SBD)**: This dataset consists of 12 angiographic image sequences with 77 angiograms of contrast agent-filled vessels. It is specifically collected to evaluate the performance of vascular branch tracking.

2. **Vessel Tree Dataset (VTD)**: This dataset contains 9 angiographic image sequences with 58 angiograms of contrast agent-filled vessels. It is used to evaluate the performance of complex vasculature tracking.

The paper also notes that both datasets were provided by Anzhen Hospital, Beijing, and that the image resolution is 512 Ã— 512 pixels with a frame rate of 15 frames/s. Additionally, it mentions that three experts manually delineated the centerlines in the clinical angiograms, which were used as ground truth.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are not associated with specific published papers but rather provided by a hospital, I will note that the citation for these datasets will reflect their source:

- For **Single Branch Dataset (SBD)**, the citation is:
  > Anzhen Hospital, Beijing. *Single Branch Dataset (SBD)*. Unpublished dataset.

- For **Vessel Tree Dataset (VTD)**, the citation is:
  > Anzhen Hospital, Beijing. *Vessel Tree Dataset (VTD)*. Unpublished dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.

This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
