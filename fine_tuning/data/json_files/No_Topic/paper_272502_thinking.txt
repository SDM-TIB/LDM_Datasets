To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic modelling reveals mechanisms of metabolic heterogeneity" by Mona K. Tonn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may include mentions of datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their research. This section often contextualizes the study and may reference previous datasets that are relevant to their work.

In the **methods section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments or simulations. This section typically details the data collection process, including any datasets that were analyzed or generated during the study.

The **results section** may also contain references to datasets, especially if the authors present findings based on specific data analyses. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize data from specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets used, including their significance and any limitations. This section may also reference additional datasets that were not mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to metabolic heterogeneity, enzyme expression, and any specific experimental data that the authors might have used to support their findings.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.
