To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alarm-Based Prescriptive Process Monitoring" by Irene Teinemaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical evaluation using real-life event logs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **Evaluation section** (Section 5). Specifically, they list:

1. **BPIC2017**: This dataset records execution traces from a loan application process in a Dutch financial institution. The authors mention that it is split into two sub-logs: bpic2017 refused and bpic2017 cancelled.

2. **Road Traffic Fines**: This dataset originates from the Italian local police, where the desired outcome is that a fine is fully paid, while the undesired cases involve sending the fine for credit collection.

3. **Unemployment**: This dataset corresponds to the Unemployment Benefits scenario discussed earlier in the paper. However, the authors note that privacy constraints prevent them from making this event log publicly available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on the context:

- For **BPIC2017**, the citation is:
  > "BPIC2017: Event log of a loan application process in a Dutch financial institution." Available at: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:5f3067df-f10b-45da-b98b-86ae4c7a310b

- For **Road Traffic Fines**, the citation is:
  > "Road Traffic Fines Dataset." Available at: https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:270fd440-1057-4fb9-89a9-b699b47990f5

- For **Unemployment**, since the dataset is not publicly available, I will note that it is based on a real-world scenario but does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
