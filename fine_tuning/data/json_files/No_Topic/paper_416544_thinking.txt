To extract datasets from the research paper titled "World Wine Exports: What Determined the Success of the ‘New World’ Wine Producers?" by Osiris Jorge Parcero and Emiliano Villanueva, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the world wine industry from 1961 to 2005, which suggests that there may be historical data involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and econometric model)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the analysis. Here, the authors mention using a panel of 47 geographical units (38 countries and 9 regions) and refer to the **Global Wine Statistical Compendium (GWSC)** as the source for their data on wine exports and imports.

In this section, I will note the specific countries and regions included in the dataset, which are:

- Argentina
- Australia
- Austria
- Azerbaijan
- Belgium-Luxembourg
- Brazil
- Bulgaria
- Canada
- Chile
- China
- Croatia
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Georgia
- Germany
- Greece
- Hungary
- Ireland
- Italy
- Japan
- Mexico
- North Africa
- Other Africa
- Other Asia-Pacific
- Other Central and Eastern Europe
- Other Latin American and Caribbean
- Other North and East Asia
- Other West Europe
- Portugal
- Romania
- Russia
- South-East Asia
- South Africa
- Spain
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- Turkey
- Ukraine
- United Kingdom
- United States
- Uruguay
- Uzbekistan

The GWSC reports data for these countries and regions, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of wine exports and imports.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the GWSC dataset. The citation is as follows:

> Adelaide University, Monash University and the Australian Government. (2007). *The global statistical compendium, 1961-2005*. Adelaide: Adelaide University.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Global Wine Statistical Compendium (GWSC)
   - **Description**: A comprehensive dataset that reports data on wine exports and imports for 47 geographical units (38 countries and 9 regions) from 1961 to 2005.
   - **Full Citation**: Adelaide University, Monash University and the Australian Government. (2007). *The global statistical compendium, 1961-2005*. Adelaide: Adelaide University.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
