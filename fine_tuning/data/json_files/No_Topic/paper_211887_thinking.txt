To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing the Perceived Severity of Cybersecurity Threats Reported on Social Media" by Shi Zong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a **corpus of 6,000 tweets** annotated with opinions on the severity of cybersecurity threats, which suggests that this is a primary dataset.

Next, I will examine the **data collection section** (Section 2.1) where the authors describe how they collected tweets using specific keywords. They mention tracking the keywords “ddos” and “vulnerability” from December 2017 to July 2018, which confirms the existence of a dataset based on these tweets.

In **Section 2.2 (Mechanical Turk Annotation)**, the authors detail the annotation process for the dataset of tweets. They mention that the dataset consists of **6,000 tweets**, with a breakdown of how many were labeled as containing threats and how many were annotated for severity. This reinforces the significance of this dataset.

Additionally, in **Section 3 (Forecasting Severe Cybersecurity Threats)**, the authors mention another dataset collected from January 2016 to November 2017, which includes **976,180 tweets** that contain the keyword “vulnerability.” This dataset is used for a large-scale evaluation, indicating its importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset, which is the annotated corpus of tweets, does not have a specific citation since it is created by the authors. However, I will note the details as follows:

1. **Annotated Corpus of Tweets**: A dataset of 6,000 tweets annotated with opinions toward threat severity.
   - Citation: Zong, S., Ritter, A., Mueller, G., & Wright, E. (2023). *Analyzing the Perceived Severity of Cybersecurity Threats Reported on Social Media*. The Ohio State University.

2. **Large-scale Tweet Dataset**: A dataset of 976,180 tweets collected from January 2016 to November 2017 that contain the keyword “vulnerability.”
   - Citation: Zong, S., Ritter, A., Mueller, G., & Wright, E. (2023). *Analyzing the Perceived Severity of Cybersecurity Threats Reported on Social Media*. The Ohio State University.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.
