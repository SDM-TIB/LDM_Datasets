To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning Beyond Linear Prediction Functions" by Ziping Xu and Ambuj Tewari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets, as well as any accompanying text that describes their characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the methodology and datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named, along with their descriptions, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ImageNet," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not cited directly, I will search for authoritative sources or papers that describe the dataset to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
