To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Large-Scale Ordinal Regression Model" by Yong Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "fifty text ordinal regression datasets are provided or collected for testing and comparing." This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors list several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **TripAdvisor Dataset**: A dataset about hotel reviews scored on a scale from one to five stars.
2. **Yelp Reviews**: Obtained from the Yelp Dataset Challenge, used to predict the full number of stars given by users.
3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**: A classification task consisting of sentences from movie reviews with human annotations of sentiment.
4. **Movie Review Dataset**: A collection of movie reviews with ratings converted from a four-star system.
5. **Large Movie Dataset**: A movie review dataset for eight-class sentiment classification containing 25,000 reviews for training and testing.
6. **Doctor Quality Dataset**: A Chinese E-health dataset collected from a doctor consulting app, where patients assess doctors after consultations.
7. **Eight Amazon Product Datasets**: Collected from various sources, each consisting of product reviews with overall rating scores.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citation for the **Yelp Reviews** dataset is:
> Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that each dataset is described clearly, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of instances or classes.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and well-organized.
