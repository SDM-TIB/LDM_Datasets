To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crosswashing in Sustainable Investing: Unveiling Strategic Practices Impacting ESG Scores" by Bertrand Kian Hassani and Yacoub Bahini, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on crosswashing and its impact on ESG scores, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any specific datasets used for their quantitative analysis. In this section, they mention using data from **TotalEnergies (2022)**, which is crucial for my extraction process.

I will then look for any **tables or figures** that present data. The paper includes several tables, particularly in **section 4 (Use case)**, where they describe the MCDM approach and present data related to TotalEnergies' activities. I will focus on the tables that summarize the turnover ratios and capital expenditure (CapEx) ratios, as these are likely to contain relevant dataset information.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **TotalEnergies ESG Databook 2022**: This dataset includes financial metrics related to environmentally sustainable activities, specifically turnover and capital expenditure figures. The authors reference this dataset in their analysis, indicating its importance for evaluating crosswashing practices.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For **TotalEnergies ESG Databook 2022**, the citation is:
  > TotalEnergies. *ESG Databook 2022*. Available at: https://totalenergies.com/investors/esg. Accessed on: September 13, 2024.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset and its relevance to the study's findings. I will summarize the dataset's key attributes, such as its focus on ESG metrics and its role in the analysis of crosswashing practices.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the extracted dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
