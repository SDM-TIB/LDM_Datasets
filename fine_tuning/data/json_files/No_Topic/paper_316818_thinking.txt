To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Review of Kernel Learning for Intra-Hour Solar Forecasting with Infrared Sky Images and Cloud Dynamic Feature Extraction" by Guillermo Terrén-Serrano and Manel Martínez-Ramón, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a **Girasol Dataset**, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the dataset used for training and testing. They mention that the dataset consists of **IR images and GSI measurements** collected over 52 days, with a breakdown of how the data was split into training and testing sets.

I will also check the **data availability section** to find any references to where the dataset can be accessed. The authors provide a link to a DRYAD repository, which indicates that the dataset is publicly available.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Girasol Dataset**: This dataset includes IR images and global solar irradiance (GSI) measurements collected over 52 days. It is used for training and testing the proposed solar forecasting algorithms.

The full citation for the Girasol Dataset is:
> Guillermo Terrén-Serrano, Adnan Bashir, Trilce Estrada, and Manel Martínez-Ramón. *Girasol, a sky imaging and global solar irradiance dataset*. Data in Brief, page 106914, 2021. DOI: 10.5061/dryad.zcrjdfn9m.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of the dataset and its citation for further processing or review.
