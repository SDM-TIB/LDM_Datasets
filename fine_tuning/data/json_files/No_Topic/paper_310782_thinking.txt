To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Burst Imaging for Light-Constrained Structure-From-Motion" by Ahalya Ravendran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are releasing a dataset containing raw Bayer images captured under low light conditions, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **results and experiments sections** to find detailed descriptions of the dataset. In the introduction, the authors mention capturing burst imagery of real scenes in an illumination-controlled environment, which suggests that they have collected specific data for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail: they captured images over 20 scenes with various objects, resulting in a total of 6160 images collected in 880 bursts. They specify that the dataset includes raw Bayer images captured at different exposure times (1ms and 0.1ms). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **conclusion and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional context or insights about the dataset's potential applications or significance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset and code are available at a specific URL: https://roboticimaging.org/Projects/BurstSfM/. However, I need to ensure that I provide a proper citation format for the dataset itself, which may not be explicitly listed in the references.

Since the dataset is part of the authors' contributions in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
> Ahalya Ravendran, Mitch Bryson, and Donald G. Dansereau. *Burst Imaging for Light-Constrained Structure-From-Motion*. Dataset available at: https://roboticimaging.org/Projects/BurstSfM/.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the dataset from the paper.
