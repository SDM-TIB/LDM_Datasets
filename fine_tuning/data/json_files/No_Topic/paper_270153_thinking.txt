To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-field Remote Fingerprint Authentication using Human Body Communication and On-Hub Analytics" by Debayan Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the need for biometric authentication in tactical environments but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of biometric authentication but do not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the **system components** and **experimental results** sections, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used for testing or validation.

Upon reviewing the **experimental results**, I find that the authors mention using the **FVC2002 database** for fingerprint image enhancement and minutiae extraction comparisons. This is a specific dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FVC2002 database. The relevant citation is:

- For the **FVC2002 database**, the citation is:
  > Davide Maltoni, Dario Maio, Anil K. Jain, and Sabina Prabhakar. *FVC2002: Second Fingerprint Verification Competition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Biometric Authentication (ICBA), pages 1-7, 2002.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **FVC2002 Database**: This dataset is used for evaluating fingerprint image enhancement and minutiae extraction algorithms. It contains a collection of fingerprint images that are commonly used in biometric research.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
