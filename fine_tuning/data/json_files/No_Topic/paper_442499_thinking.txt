To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BSRBF-KAN: A Combination of B-Splines and Radial Basis Functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" by Hoang-Thang Ta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to confirm the details about these datasets. In Section 4, the author explicitly states that the experiments were conducted on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets, providing additional context about their use in training and evaluating the BSRBF-KAN model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research [Best of the Web]*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141â€“142, 2012.

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the datasets used in the research.
