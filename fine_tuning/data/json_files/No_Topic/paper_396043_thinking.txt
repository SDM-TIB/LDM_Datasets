To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpecTracle: Wearable Facial Motion Tracking from Unobtrusive Peripheral Cameras" by Yinan Xuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methods section for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.4 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. Here, they mention that they collected data from 9 participants, which resulted in a dataset of 172,000 samples. This indicates that there is a dataset created specifically for this study.

In **section 2.5 (Dataset)**, the authors detail the data preparation and cleaning process. They mention that the dataset consists of facial motion data collected from participants performing various facial expressions. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will refer to it as the "SpecTracle Facial Motion Dataset" for clarity.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers or datasets that might have been used as a basis for their data collection or methodology. However, the authors do not cite any external datasets for their own dataset, as they primarily describe their own data collection process.

The relevant citations for the dataset I identified are as follows:

1. **SpecTracle Facial Motion Dataset**: 
   - This dataset was created as part of the study and includes 172,000 samples of facial motion data collected from 9 participants. The dataset is not published externally, but it is referenced in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the name of the dataset and a brief description of its contents, along with the citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Xuan, Y.; Viswanath, V.; Chu, S.; Bartolf, O.; Echterhoff, J.; Wang, E. *SpecTracle: Wearable Facial Motion Tracking from Unobtrusive Peripheral Cameras*. Sensors 2023, 1, 0. https://doi.org/

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SpecTracle Facial Motion Dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise for future reference or processing.
