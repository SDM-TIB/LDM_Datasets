To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAIM â€“ A ConvNet Method for Unsupervised 3D Medical Image Registration" by Dongyang Kuang and Tanya Schmah, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Mindboggle101 dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more context about the dataset. The introduction discusses the challenges of medical image registration and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The methods section will likely provide more details about how the dataset is utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Mindboggle101 dataset**. They explain that it consists of 101 T1-weighted MRIs from healthy subjects and that they used specific subsets of this dataset (NKI-RS-22, NKI-TRT-20, and OASIS-TRT-20) for their experiments. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specifics about its composition and preprocessing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Mindboggle101 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Mindboggle101 dataset**:
  > Klein, A., & Tourville, J. (2012). 101 labeled brain images and a consistent human cortical labeling protocol. *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 6, 171.

Since the authors used specific subsets of the Mindboggle101 dataset, I will note that while the subsets are mentioned, the original dataset citation is what is required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Mindboggle101 dataset** in my output. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly referenced.
