To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A game theoretical approach to homothetic robust forward investment performance processes in stochastic factor models" by Juan Li, Wenqiang Li, and Gechun Liang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. For instance, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will search the references for the corresponding citation, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset Paper*. Journal/Conference, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant information for each dataset extracted from the paper.
