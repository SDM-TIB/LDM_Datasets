To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graded Relevance Assessments and Graded Relevance Measures of NTCIR" by Tetsuya Sakai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, which may include references to specific datasets used in the NTCIR tasks.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** of the paper, as these sections often detail the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also pay close attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or their properties, as these can provide concise information about the datasets used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions the "NTCIR-1 test collections" or "NTCIR-6 CLIR task," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, to ensure that they are accurately represented and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is described with its citation, making it easy for readers to understand the context and significance of each dataset in relation to the research presented in the paper.
