To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering Time Series with Nonlinear Dynamics" by Alexander Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in identifying them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will focus on sections that discuss the application of their clustering framework to specific datasets, particularly in the context of neural spiking data.

In the **results section**, the authors mention the application of their framework to **neural spiking time series acquired from the prefrontal cortex of mice**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to neural activity that is central to their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. The authors may cite original papers or datasets that provide more context or details about the data they used. 

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Neural Spiking Time Series Dataset**: This dataset consists of time series data from 33 neurons in the prefrontal cortex of mice, collected during a fear-conditioning experiment. The authors describe how this dataset is used to analyze neuronal responses to stimuli.

2. **Simulated Neural Rasters Dataset**: The authors also mention a simulated dataset comprising 25 neuronal rasters generated for testing their clustering framework. This dataset is used to validate the performance of their model.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **neural spiking time series dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allsop, S. A., Wichmann, R., Mills, F., Burgos-Robles, A., Chang, C.-J., Felix-Ortiz, A. C., Vienne, A., Beyeler, A., Izadmehr, E. M., Glober, G., et al. (2018). Corticoamygdala transfer of socially derived information gates observational learning. *Cell*, 173(6):1329â€“1342.

- For the **simulated neural rasters dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as:
  > Lin, A., Zhang, Y., Heng, J., Allsop, S. A., Tye, K. M., Jacob, P. E., & Ba, D. (2019). Clustering Time Series with Nonlinear Dynamics. *Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)*, Naha, Okinawa, Japan.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
