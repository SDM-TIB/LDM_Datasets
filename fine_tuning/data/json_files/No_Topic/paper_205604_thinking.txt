To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-armed Bandits with Compensation" by Siwei Wang and Longbo Huang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it can indicate whether datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any specific conditions under which they were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I may need to conduct a brief search for the datasets online to find their original sources and ensure accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that is clear and easy to understand.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Conduct additional searches if necessary to ensure accurate citations.
5. Compile the information into a clear format for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
