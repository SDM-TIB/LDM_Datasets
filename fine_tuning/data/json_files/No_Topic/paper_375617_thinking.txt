To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Expressiveness and Generalization of Hypergraph Neural Networks" by Zhezheng Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experiments." This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their use in experiments. These visual aids often contain crucial information that may not be fully detailed in the text.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses a dataset called "Graph Substructure Detection," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the dataset online or in related literature to find the appropriate citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
