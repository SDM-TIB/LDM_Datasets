To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal â„“1 Column Subset Selection and a Fast PTAS for Low Rank Approximation" by Arvind V. Mahankali and David P. Woodruff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments in these sections. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the citation that includes:
- Authors
- Title of the dataset or paper
- Publication details (journal, conference, etc.)
- Year of publication

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, in a clear and organized manner.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
