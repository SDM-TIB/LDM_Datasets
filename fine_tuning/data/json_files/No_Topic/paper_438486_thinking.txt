To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PTM-VQA: Efficient Video Quality Assessment Leveraging Diverse PreTrained Models from the Wild" by Kun Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several NR-VQA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **KoNViD-1k**: This dataset contains 1,200 videos filtered from a larger dataset (YFCC100M) and is used for assessing video quality. Each video has an average of 114 annotations for reliable Mean Opinion Scores (MOS).

2. **LIVE-VQC**: This dataset consists of 585 videos with complex authentic distortions, captured by 80 different users across various devices, with 240 annotations per video.

3. **YouTube-UGC**: This dataset includes 1,380 user-generated content videos sampled from YouTube, with a duration of 20 seconds and various resolutions, each having 123 annotations.

4. **LSVQ**: The largest VQA dataset, proposed in 2021, containing 39,076 videos.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **KoNViD-1k**, the citation is:
  > Vlad Hosu, Franz Hahn, Mohsen Jenadeleh, Hanhe Lin, Hui Men, Tamás Szirányi, Shujun Li, and Dietmar Saupe. *The Konstanz Natural Video Database (KoNViD-1k)*. In QoMEX, pages 1–6, IEEE, 2017.

- For **LIVE-VQC**, the citation is:
  > Zeina Sinno and Alan Conrad Bovik. *Large-scale study of perceptual video quality*. IEEE Trans. Image Process., 28(2):612–627, 2019.

- For **YouTube-UGC**, the citation is:
  > Zhengzhong Tu, Yilin Wang, Neil Birkbeck, Balu Adsumilli, and Alan C. Bovik. *UGC-VQA: Benchmarking Blind Video Quality Assessment for User Generated Content*. IEEE Trans. Image Process., 30:4449–4464, 2021.

- For **LSVQ**, the citation is:
  > Zhenqiang Ying, Maniratnam Mandal, Deepti Ghadiyaram, and Alan C. Bovik. *Patch-VQ: ‘Patching Up’ the Video Quality Problem*. In CVPR, pages 14019–14029, Computer Vision Foundation / IEEE, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
