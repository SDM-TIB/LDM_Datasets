To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Neural Machine Translation Ready for Deployment? A Case Study on 30 Translation Directions" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the **United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0** in detail. They mention that it contains approximately 11 million sentences aligned across six languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish), which confirms its significance in their experiments.

In the **training data section**, specifically **section 2.1**, the authors provide further details about the UN corpus, including statistics such as the number of documents and lines, which reinforces the importance of this dataset for their study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0**. The citation provided is:
> M. Ziemski, M. Junczys-Dowmunt, and B. Pouliquen. "The United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0," in LREC 2016. ELRA, 2016.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or verification by others interested in the dataset.
