To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TenDSuR: Tensor-Based 4D Sub-Nyquist Radar" by Siqi Na et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and numerical experiments, where datasets are more likely to be explicitly mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various radar systems and techniques but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **numerical experiments section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and results. This section is crucial as it often contains details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Upon reviewing the **numerical experiments**, I find that the authors mention using a radar system with specific parameters but do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they reference previous works and prototypes, which may imply the use of established datasets in the field.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets. The references may include papers that describe datasets used in radar research. I will look for any papers that are known to provide datasets relevant to sub-Nyquist radar systems.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers, but none of them explicitly mention a dataset that they used in their experiments. This indicates that the authors may have used proprietary or unpublished datasets, or they may have relied on simulations rather than publicly available datasets.

Since I did not find any specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **No explicit datasets were identified** in the abstract, introduction, or numerical experiments sections.
2. **References** do not provide any direct citations for datasets used in the experiments.

Given this analysis, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any datasets that can be extracted with full citations. If I were to summarize the findings, I would note the lack of explicit dataset references in the paper.

In summary, I will prepare a report indicating that no datasets were found in the paper "TenDSuR: Tensor-Based 4D Sub-Nyquist Radar" by Siqi Na et al., and thus no citations can be provided.
