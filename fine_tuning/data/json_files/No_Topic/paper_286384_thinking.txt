To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear unit-tests for invariance discovery" by Benjamin Aubin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the purpose of the paper and mentions "six linear low-dimensional problems" but does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of machine learning systems in different training conditions but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention causal learning algorithms and their reliance on diverse training datasets, which indicates that datasets will be discussed later.

I will then focus on the **Problems section** (Section 2), where the authors describe six linear problems. Each problem is likely associated with a dataset. As I read through each example (Example 1, Example 2, etc.), I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or how the datasets are constructed.

In **Example 1**, the authors describe a linear regression problem and provide a detailed methodology for constructing datasets, but they do not name a specific dataset. Instead, they describe how to sample data for their experiments.

In **Example 2**, the authors present a binary classification problem involving cows and camels. Again, they describe how to construct the datasets but do not reference any existing datasets.

In **Example 3**, the authors describe another problem but continue to focus on the construction of synthetic datasets rather than referencing established datasets.

After reviewing all examples, I will note that the authors do not refer to any pre-existing datasets but instead create synthetic datasets for their experiments. This is a common practice in research focused on theoretical contributions, where the datasets are generated based on specific criteria outlined in the paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. However, since the paper primarily discusses synthetic datasets created for the purpose of their experiments, there are no full citations for datasets as they are not derived from existing sources.

In conclusion, while I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they are synthetic and constructed by the authors, I will document the methodology for dataset creation as described in the paper. This will include the parameters and processes used to generate the datasets for each of the six problems discussed.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the synthetic datasets into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
