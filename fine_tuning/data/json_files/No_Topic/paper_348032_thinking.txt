To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Novices: The Role of Human-AI Collaboration and Knowledge Transfer" by Philipp Spitzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a preliminary experiment design that involves a house pricing dataset, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Preliminary Experiment Design)**, where the authors describe the experiment setup. They specifically mention using a **house pricing dataset** for their regression task. The dataset consists of tabular data and images of houses, and it is sourced from Kaggle, which is a crucial detail for citation.

I will note the details provided about the dataset:
- The dataset includes **15,474 samples**.
- The authors plan to use only the tabular data for their experiment.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the house pricing dataset is:

- **House Prices and Images - SoCal**: 
  > Dogan, T. House prices and images - socal. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal, Accessed: 2022-05-20. 2019.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete with the full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
