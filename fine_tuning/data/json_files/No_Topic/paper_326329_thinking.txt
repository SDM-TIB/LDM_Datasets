To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Decipher: A transparent dual-attention graph neural network to understand the message-passing mechanism for the node classification" by Yan Pang and Chao Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **seven datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they list the datasets in **Table 2**, which summarizes the statistics of the seven datasets. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,485 nodes, 5,069 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 2,110 nodes, 3,668 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,324 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **Coauthor CS**: A co-authorship dataset with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, and 15 classes.
5. **Amazon Computers**: A product co-purchase dataset with 13,381 nodes, 245,778 edges, and 10 classes.
6. **Amazon Photo**: Another product co-purchase dataset with 7,487 nodes, 119,043 edges, and 8 classes.
7. **Coauthor Physics**: A co-authorship dataset with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, and 5 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original sources for the Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed datasets, which are commonly used in the graph neural network community. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **Cora** and **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, B., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In *10th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs*.

- For **Coauthor CS** and **Coauthor Physics**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & GÂ¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **Amazon Computers** and **Amazon Photo**, the citation is:
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources for further processing or review.
