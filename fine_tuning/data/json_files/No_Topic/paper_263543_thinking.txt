To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MTCRNN: A Multi-Scale RNN for Directed Audio Texture Synthesis" by Muhammad Huzaifah and Lonce Wyse, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the model's performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific dataset names or descriptions. The introduction provides context about audio textures but does not explicitly name datasets.

I will then focus on the **model** and **results** sections, particularly looking for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used. In the **model section**, the authors mention using the **Parameterized Audio Textures Data Sets (PATSets)** and **heartbeat sounds from the PASCAL CHSC2011 dataset**. This is a crucial finding as it directly identifies the datasets involved in their experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the datasets, including their properties and the control parameters used for each. The datasets listed include:

1. **Container Filling**: This dataset is used to model the sound of water filling a container, with control parameters related to fill height.
2. **Heartbeat**: This dataset consists of heartbeat sounds, with control parameters related to class and rate.
3. **Engine**: This dataset includes engine sounds, with control parameters related to rev.
4. **Fire**: This dataset models the sound of fire, with control parameters related to onset strength.
5. **Geiger Counter**: This dataset simulates the sound of a Geiger counter, with control parameters related to rate.
6. **Pop**: This dataset includes sounds of popping, with control parameters related to onset strength.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For the **Parameterized Audio Textures Data Sets (PATSets)**, the citation is:
  > Lonce Wyse and Muhammad Huzaifah. *Deep learning models for generating audio textures*. In 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity, Stockholm, Sweden, 2020.

- For the **PASCAL CHSC2011 dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Bentley, G. Nordehn, M. Coimbra, and S. Manor. *The PASCAL classifying heart sounds challenge results*. http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/index.html, 2011. Accessed: 2020-04-28.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
