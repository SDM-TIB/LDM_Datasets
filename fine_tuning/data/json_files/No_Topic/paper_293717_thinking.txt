To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIP-NET: Bidirectional Perspective Strategy Based Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection Network" by Chuang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that their experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BiP-Net on **MSRA-TD500, CTW1500, and ICDAR2015 datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of scene text detection but does not provide further dataset information.

Moving on to the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They describe:

1. **MSRA-TD500**: This dataset consists of long multi-lingual text instances, containing 700 training images and 200 testing images.
2. **CTW1500**: This dataset mainly consists of curved text instances, containing 1000 images for training and 500 images for testing.
3. **ICDAR2015**: This dataset contains 1000 training images and 500 testing images, featuring multi-oriented text instances in complex backgrounds.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors compare their method against state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, further confirming their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MSRA-TD500**, the citation is:
  > C. Yao, X. Bai, W. Liu, Y. Ma, and Z. Tu. "Detecting texts of arbitrary orientations in natural images." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1083–1090, 2012.

- For **CTW1500**, the citation is:
  > Y. Liu, L. Jin, S. Zhang, and S. Zhang. "Detecting curve text in the wild: New dataset and new solution." arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.02170, 2017.

- For **ICDAR2015**, the citation is:
  > D. Karatzas, L. Gomez, A. Nicolaou, S. Ghosh, A. Bagdanov, M. Iwamura, J. Matas, L. Neumann, V. Chandrasekhar, and S. Lu. "ICDAR 2015 competition on robust reading." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1156–1160, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further use or analysis.
