To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Sample Complexity of Vanilla Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Dependent Samples" by Mustafa O. Karabag and Ufuk Topcu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. If a specific section is not present, I will check for any references to datasets within the text of the methodology or results.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training purposes. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets collected from specific environments or simulations, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
