To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AANG: Automating Auxiliary Learning" by Lucio M. Dery et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on **five NLP tasks**, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section 6)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they use a pre-trained RoBERTa model and that the experiments are conducted on low-resource classification tasks. They also refer to a **Table 4** that lists the datasets used.

I will locate **Table 4** in the paper, which provides detailed specifications of the datasets. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **BIOMED**: Used for relation classification, with a training size of 4,169 examples.
2. **CS**: Another relation classification dataset, with a training size of 3,219 examples.
3. **STANCE**: A stance detection dataset, with a training size of 2,497 examples.
4. **NEWS**: A citation intent dataset, with a training size of 1,688 examples.
5. **CHEMPROT**: A relation classification dataset, with a training size of 515 examples.
6. **SCIERC**: A citation intent dataset, with a training size of 3,469 examples.
7. **SE-2016-6**: A partisanship dataset, with a training size of 3469 examples.
8. **ACL-ARC**: A dataset for citation intent, with a training size of 1,688 examples.
9. **H.PARTISAN**: A partisanship dataset, with a training size of 515 examples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
