To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MindSet: Vision. A toolbox for testing DNNs on key psychological experiments" by Valerio Biscione et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a toolbox consisting of a collection of image datasets designed to test DNNs on psychological findings. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets included in the toolbox. The section is organized into three broad categories: Low and Mid-Level Vision, Visual Illusions, and Shape and Object Recognition. Each category contains specific datasets that are described in detail.

I will identify and summarize each dataset mentioned in this section:

1. **Weber Law Dataset**: This dataset assesses the relationship between physical changes in stimulus dimensions and human perception. It includes images of lines with varying lengths and brightness.

2. **Crowding/Uncrowding Dataset**: This dataset investigates the effects of nearby objects on object identification, featuring various configurations of vernier stimuli surrounded by flankers.

3. **Emergent Features Dataset**: This dataset explores how simple image features interact to create emergent properties, using dot patterns as stimuli.

4. **Amodal Completion Dataset**: This dataset examines the human visual system's ability to identify occluded objects, featuring images with occluded and notched shapes.

5. **Decomposition Dataset**: This dataset tests how DNNs group object parts, using familiar and unfamiliar objects that undergo natural or unnatural breaks.

6. **Visual Illusions Datasets**: This category includes several datasets for classic visual illusions, such as the MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion, Ponzo illusion, and Ebbinghaus illusion, each designed to test DNNs' susceptibility to these effects.

7. **Shape and Object Recognition Datasets**: This category includes datasets for line drawings, silhouettes, and familiar/unfamiliar texturized objects, assessing DNNs' ability to recognize shapes under various conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper provides citations for the original studies or datasets that inspired the creation of the datasets in MindSet: Vision. I will ensure to include these citations for each dataset.

For example, the citation for the Weber Law dataset might reference the original work that established the law, while the visual illusions datasets will reference the foundational studies that describe those illusions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
