To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Learning to Detect Retinal Vessels in Fundus Images" by Debapriya Maji et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using the **DRIVE database**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experimental results section (Section V)**, where the authors explicitly mention that they trained their ensemble of ConvNets using the **DRIVE training set (image id. 21-40)** and tested it on the **DRIVE test set (image id. 1-20)**. This confirms the use of the DRIVE dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DRIVE dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself, but it does mention that the dataset can be accessed at a specific URL. Therefore, I will note the URL as part of the dataset information.

The citation for the DRIVE dataset is as follows:
> DRIVE dataset: http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset in a typical reference format, I will include the URL as the primary reference for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset usage in the experimental results section.
3. Locate the citation or reference for the dataset in the references section.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the DRIVE dataset.
