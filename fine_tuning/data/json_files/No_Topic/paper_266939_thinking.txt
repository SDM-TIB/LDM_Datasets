To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Resource Extraction in Regime Switching Lévy Markets" by Moustapha Pemy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include references to datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or data sources**. In many research papers, authors will have a specific section where they describe the datasets they used for their analysis. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

If the paper includes **numerical examples or experiments**, I will examine these sections closely, as they often mention the datasets used for validation or testing purposes. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their size, type, and the specific variables they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. It is crucial to provide complete citations for each dataset, as this allows others to locate the original sources. I will look for any papers or reports that are cited in relation to the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation in the references, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
