To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applications of Deep Learning to Nuclear Fusion Research" by Diogo R. Ferreira and JET Contributors, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training their models, including any specific details about the data collection process, the size of the datasets, and how they were split for training and validation. 

In this paper, the author mentions that they gathered tomographic reconstructions computed at JET for all experimental campaigns between 2011 and 2016, yielding a total of **25,584 reconstructions**. This indicates a significant dataset that is crucial for their analysis.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of disruption prediction. The author states that they gathered plasma current and bolometer data for all pulses in the experimental campaigns from 2011 to 2016, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various studies and sources that may provide additional context or details about the datasets used.

For the tomographic reconstructions, the citation is:
> Ferreira, D. R., Carvalho, P. J., Fernandes, H., & JET Contributors. (2018). Full-pulse tomographic reconstruction with deep neural networks. *Fusion Science and Technology*, 74(1-2), 47-56.

For the disruption prediction data, the citation is:
> Moreno, R., Vega, J., Dormido-Canto, S., Pereira, A., Murari, A., & JET Contributors. (2016). Disruption prediction on JET during the ILW experimental campaigns. *Fusion Science and Technology*, 69(2), 485-494.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
