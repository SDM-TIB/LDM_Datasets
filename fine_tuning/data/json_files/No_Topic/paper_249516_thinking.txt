To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monitoring Browsing Behavior of Customers in Retail Stores via RFID Imaging" by Kamran Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections** of the paper, as these sections typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for testing and validation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they collected data from **10 different human subjects**. They specify that they gathered a total of **14,617 samples** from 5 of those users, which indicates a dataset used for training the model. Additionally, they mention that data from the remaining 5 users was used for testing, which is another dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from 5 users, totaling **14,617 samples**. The authors do not provide a specific name for this dataset, but it is used for training the deep learning model.

2. **Testing Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from the remaining 5 users, totaling **2,413 samples**. Similar to the training dataset, it is not explicitly named but is used for testing the model's performance.

Next, I will ensure to document the full citations for any relevant papers or datasets mentioned in the references section that could provide additional context or sources for the datasets used.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its purpose and any relevant details, including citations if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
