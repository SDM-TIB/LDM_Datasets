To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CGA-PoseNet: Camera Pose Regression via a 1D-Up Approach to Conformal Geometric Algebra" by Alberto Pepe and Joan Lasenby, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Cambridge Landmarks** and **7 Scenes** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **Cambridge Landmarks**: This dataset includes 6 outdoor scene datasets (Street, Great Court, King’s College, St. Mary’s Church, Old Hospital, and Shop Facade) with varying areas and corresponding RGB frames. The labels are generated via structure from motion.

2. **7 Scenes**: This dataset consists of 7 indoor scene datasets (Office, Pumpkin, Red Kitchen, Heads, Fire, Stairs, and Chess), each captured through a Kinect RGB-D sensor and intended for RGB-D relocalization.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **Cambridge Landmarks**, the citation is:
  > Alex Kendall, Matthew Grimes, and Roberto Cipolla. *PoseNet: A Convolutional Network for Real-Time 6-DOF Camera Relocalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2938–2946, 2015.

- For **7 Scenes**, the citation is:
  > Jamie Shotton, Ben Glocker, Christopher Zach, Shahram Izadi, Antonio Criminisi, and Andrew Fitzgibbon. *Scene Coordinate Regression Forests for Camera Relocalization in RGB-D Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2930–2937, 2013.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to compile a structured output for further processing or review.
