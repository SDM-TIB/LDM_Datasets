To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Decision-Dependent Games by Learning from Feedback" by Killian Wood et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions "numerical simulations are provided for a novel electric vehicle charging market formulation using real-world data." This suggests that there may be datasets related to electric vehicle charging.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their numerical experiments in **Section IV**. Here, they mention using "standardized demand data for six medium demand EVCSâ€™s with either consisting of either 2 or 6 ports and port power values of 50, 150, and 350 kWh." This indicates that there is a dataset related to electric vehicle charging demand.

I will also check the **figures** and **tables** for any additional datasets or data descriptions. For instance, **Figure 1** shows standardized demand data, which may imply that the data is part of a larger dataset used for analysis.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Dataset**: This dataset includes demand data for six electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) with varying power profiles. The data is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance across each station.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific reference for the dataset used in the numerical experiments. Since it mentions "real-world data," I will note that the dataset may be derived from publicly available sources or proprietary data, but without a specific citation, I cannot provide a formal reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset Name**: Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Dataset
- **Description**: Standardized demand data for six medium demand electric vehicle charging stations with varying power profiles.
- **Citation**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

I will ensure to document this information clearly, noting the absence of a formal citation for the dataset. This will help in understanding the context of the data used in the research.
