To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Towards Mitigating Spurious Correlations in the Wild: A Benchmark & a more Realistic Dataset" by Siddharth Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions two new vision datasets: **SPUCOMNIST** and **SPUCOANIMALS**, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **main body of the paper**. In the introduction, the authors highlight the limitations of existing datasets and introduce their new datasets aimed at addressing these issues. I will pay special attention to sections that describe the datasets, likely found in sections dedicated to methodology or experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I find the following details:

1. **SPUCOMNIST**: This is a synthetic dataset designed for digit recognition, where colored backgrounds are added as spurious features. The dataset allows for controlled variations in spurious feature magnitude and variance, as well as label noise. 

2. **SPUCOANIMALS**: This dataset is curated from ImageNet and includes four classes: landbirds, waterbirds, small dog breeds, and big dog breeds. It captures realistic spurious correlations and is designed to be more challenging than existing datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide separate citations for the datasets since they are newly introduced, but I can reference the paper itself as the source for both datasets.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **SPUCOMNIST**:
  > Siddharth Joshi, Yu Yang, Yihao Xue, Wenhan Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman. *Towards Mitigating Spurious Correlations in the Wild: A Benchmark & a more Realistic Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04949, 2023.

- For **SPUCOANIMALS**:
  > Siddharth Joshi, Yu Yang, Yihao Xue, Wenhan Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman. *Towards Mitigating Spurious Correlations in the Wild: A Benchmark & a more Realistic Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04949, 2023.

Since both datasets are introduced in the same paper, I will use the same citation for both.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented for further use or analysis.
