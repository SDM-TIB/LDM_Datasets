To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Online Hashing with Multi-Label Projection" by Wenzhe Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the experimental results on two common benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using two datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **FLICKR-25K**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the CIFAR-10 dataset as containing 60,000 images across 10 categories, with a specific setup for the query and training sets. They also detail the FLICKR-25K dataset, which consists of 25,000 images annotated with 24 labels, specifying how they selected images for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. For **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

2. For **FLICKR-25K**:
   > Huiskes, M. J., & Lew, M. S. (2008). The mir flickr retrieval evaluation. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval, 39â€“43.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured presentation of the datasets used in the research, ready for any further processing or review.
