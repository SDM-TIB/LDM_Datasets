To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differential Privacy of Hierarchical Census Data: An Optimization Approach" by Ferdinando Fioretto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of "very large, real datasets" for experimental results, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 11) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Census Dataset**: This dataset contains 117,630,445 groups, 7,592 leaves, and 305,276,358 individuals. It is derived from the US Census Bureau and includes socio-demographic features aggregated for privacy.

2. **NY Taxi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,282 groups and 24,489,743 individuals, representing taxi trips in New York City. The dataset is structured hierarchically with geographical locations.

3. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the NY Taxi dataset by limiting the number of group sizes to test the runtime scalability of the proposed mechanisms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper references the Census dataset and the NY Taxi dataset, but the synthetic dataset is likely not cited as it is generated for the study.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Census Dataset**: 
  > U.S. Census Bureau. 2010 census summary file 1: census of population and housing, technical documentation. https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf, 2012.

- **NY Taxi Dataset**: 
  > New York City Taxi Data. http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml. Accessed: 2019-20-04.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information from the research paper.
