To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boolean Variation and Boolean Logic BackPropagation" by Van Minh Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the computational challenges of deep learning and the motivation for the proposed methods, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **related works** section, as it often references datasets used in previous studies. However, this section primarily discusses existing literature and does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain details about the datasets used for validation or testing. In this paper, the methodology focuses on the introduction of Boolean variation and does not mention any datasets directly.

Finally, I will review the **conclusion** and **references** sections. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not mention datasets. The references section is crucial for identifying any datasets that may have been cited throughout the paper.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that it does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or validation. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were identified in this paper.

Since no datasets were found, there will be no citations to compile. I will summarize my findings accordingly, ensuring clarity in my documentation about the absence of datasets in this research paper.
