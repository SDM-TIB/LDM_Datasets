To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Best Arm Identification with Fairness Constraints on Subpopulations" by Yuhang Wu, Zeyu Zheng, and Tingyu Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments, which is crucial for understanding the practical application of their proposed algorithm.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely to see if the authors discuss specific datasets they used for testing their algorithm. This section often contains valuable information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they relate to the research problem.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important because proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "UCI Machine Learning Repository," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If they provide a specific dataset name, I will ensure to note it down along with its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and consistency.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
