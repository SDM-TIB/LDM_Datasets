To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer Folding of RNA Tetraloops: Identification of Key Force Field Deficiencies" by Petra Kührová et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their simulations. In this paper, they mention using various enhanced sampling techniques and specific RNA sequences, particularly the **5’-GAGA-3’ tetraloop**. I will note down the details of these sequences and any associated datasets.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to specific datasets used in their analysis or simulations. The authors may discuss the performance of different force fields and how they relate to the datasets they utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations of any datasets or studies they refer to. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in their research.

For this paper, I expect to find the following datasets:

1. **5’-GAGA-3’ RNA Tetraloop**: This is the primary dataset used in their simulations. I will ensure to note the specific details about its structure and any modifications made during the study.

2. **AMBER Force Field Parameters**: The paper discusses various force fields, including modifications to the AMBER force field. I will look for any specific datasets or references related to these parameters.

3. **Simulation Data**: The authors mention performing multiple simulations with different conditions (e.g., ionic strength, force field variations). I will summarize the key simulation datasets, including their configurations and results.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are formatted correctly and include all relevant details such as authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.
