To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose-Aware Person Recognition" by Vijay Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of new benchmarks for evaluating person recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In **subsection 4.1.1 (Photo Album Dataset)**, the authors describe the **PIPA dataset**:
- **PIPA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 37,107 photos containing 63,188 instances of 2,356 identities collected from user-uploaded photos on Flickr. It includes four splits for training, validation, and testing.

In **subsection 4.1.2 (Hannah Movie Dataset)**, the authors discuss the **Hannah dataset**:
- **Hannah Dataset**: This dataset comprises 153,833 movie frames from "Hannah and Her Sisters," containing 245 shots and 202,178 face bounding boxes. It includes 41 named subjects and various unnamed characters.

In **subsection 4.1.3 (Soccer Dataset)**, the authors detail the **Soccer dataset**:
- **Soccer Dataset**: This dataset is created from broadcast videos of the World Cup 2014 final match, consisting of 37 video clips with 28 subjects, including players from both teams and a referee.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **PIPA Dataset**: 
  > N. Zhang, M. Paluri, Y. Taigman, R. Fergus, and L. Bourdev. *Beyond frontal faces: Improving person recognition using multiple cues*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- **Hannah Dataset**: 
  > A. Ozerov, J.-R. Vigouroux, L. Chevallier, and P. PÃ©rez. *On evaluating face tracks in movies*. In ICIP, 2013.

- **Soccer Dataset**: 
  > M. Bertini, A. Del Bimbo, and W. Nunziati. *Player identification in soccer videos*. In SIGMM workshop on Multimedia information retrieval, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
