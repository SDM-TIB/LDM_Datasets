To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Bug-Localization in Student Programs" by Rahul Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions a "dataset containing student written C programs for 29 different programming tasks," which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for training and evaluation. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of student-written C programs for 29 different programming tasks, along with the instructor-provided test suite for each task. They mention that the dataset contains a total of 231 tests across these tasks, which is crucial information.

In this section, I will note the following details:
- The dataset includes programs that pass and fail tests, with specific statistics provided (e.g., average programs per task, average tests per task, etc.).
- The authors state that they discard programs that do not pass any tests, focusing on those that can benefit from bug-localization.

I will also check the **evaluation dataset** mentioned in section 4.3, where the authors describe how they identify buggy lines in the programs by comparing them to corrected versions. This evaluation dataset is derived from the same student submissions and is used to assess the performance of their bug-localization technique.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is primarily based on student submissions from their own course, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics and provide a description based on the information gathered.

The key datasets identified are:
1. **Student-written C programs dataset**: This dataset consists of C programs written by students for 29 different programming tasks, with a total of 231 instructor-written tests. The dataset includes both correct and buggy programs, with specific statistics on the number of programs and tests.

2. **Evaluation dataset**: This dataset is derived from the student-written programs and includes pairs of buggy programs and their corresponding failing test IDs, used for evaluating the bug-localization technique.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations where applicable. If there are no formal citations for the datasets, I will provide a clear description of their origin and characteristics instead.
