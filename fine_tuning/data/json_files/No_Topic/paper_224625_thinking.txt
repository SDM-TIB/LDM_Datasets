To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NETR-Tree: An Efficient Framework for Social-Based Time-Aware Spatial Keyword Query" by Zhixian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real data collected from two different real-life location-based social networks (LBSNs). This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the Yelp Dataset Challenge and contains geographic locations, keywords, check-in time, and relationship information.

2. **Weeplaces Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the popular LBSN Weeplaces and also includes geographic locations, keywords, check-in time, and relationship information.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- For the **Weeplaces Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Wei, W., Sun, A., Miao, C. *Exploiting geographical neighborhood characteristics for location recommendation*. In: ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). pp. 739â€“748, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
