To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NutritionVerse-Synth: An Open Access Synthetically Generated 2D Food Scene Dataset for Dietary Intake Estimation" by Saeejith Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **NutritionVerse-Synth (NV-Synth)** dataset, which is a synthetic food image dataset containing 84,984 images. This indicates that a primary dataset is present.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, specifically the parts that discuss the creation of the NV-Synth dataset. The authors describe how the dataset was generated using a framework that leverages 3D food models from the **NutritionVerse-3D** dataset. This suggests that there is another dataset involved, which is the source of the 3D food models.

In the **results and discussion** section, the authors provide further details about the NV-Synth dataset, including its composition and the types of annotations included. They also mention that NV-Synth is the largest public synthetic food dataset, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. **NutritionVerse-Synth (NV-Synth)**: Since this is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Saeejith Nair, Chi-en Amy Tai, Yuhao Chen, Alexander Wong. *NutritionVerse-Synth: An Open Access Synthetically Generated 2D Food Scene Dataset for Dietary Intake Estimation*. In Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).

2. **NutritionVerse-3D**: This dataset is referenced as the source of 3D food models used to create NV-Synth. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chi-en Amy Tai, Matthew Keller, Mattie Kerrigan, Yuhao Chen, Saeejith Nair, Pengcheng Xi, Alexander Wong. *Nutritionverse-3d: A 3d food model dataset for nutritional intake estimation*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Women in Computer Vision (WiCV), Vancouver, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
