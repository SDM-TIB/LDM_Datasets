To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Weighted Attention Network with Camera Spectral Sensitivity Prior for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images" by Jiaojiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on datasets from the NTIRE 2020 Spectral Reconstruction Challenge, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **NTIRE2018 Dataset**: This dataset contains 256 natural hyperspectral images for training, along with 5 validation images and 10 testing images. All images have a spatial resolution of 1392 × 1300 and consist of 31 spectral bands ranging from 400 to 700 nm at roughly 10 nm increments.

2. **NTIRE2020 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 450 images for training, 10 images for validation, and 20 images for testing, with a spatial resolution of 512 × 482 and also includes 31 spectral bands.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **References section** to obtain the full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For the **NTIRE2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boaz Arad, Ohad Ben-Shahar, and Radu Timofte. *NTIRE 2018 Challenge on Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 929–938, 2018.

- For the **NTIRE2020 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boaz Arad, Radu Timofte, Ohad Ben-Shahar, Yi-Tun Lin, Graham Finlayson, et al. *NTIRE 2020 Challenge on Spectral Reconstruction from an RGB Image*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, June 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
