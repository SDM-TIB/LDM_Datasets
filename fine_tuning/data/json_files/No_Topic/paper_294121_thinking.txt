To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IQDet: Instance-wise Quality Distribution Sampling for Object Detection" by Yuchen Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that extensive experiments were conducted on the **MS COCO** dataset, which indicates that this dataset is likely a key component of their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **MS COCO** dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for object detection tasks.

I will also check the **related work** and **methods** sections to see if there are any additional datasets referenced or if the authors discuss any other datasets that might have been used in prior research. However, the primary focus appears to be on the **MS COCO** dataset.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MS COCO** dataset. The citation for the MS COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasconcelos, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **MS COCO** dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
