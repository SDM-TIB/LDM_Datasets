To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spoken Language Translation for Polish" by Krzysztof Marasek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of spoken language translation (SLT) and references experiences from specific projects, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Polish data preparation)**, which discusses acoustic data. Here, the authors mention using the **Speecon corpus** for initial acoustic models. I will note down the details of this dataset.

In the same section, the authors describe various domains of data collected, including parliamentary data, subtitling data from Euronews, and lecture recordings. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their sizes and characteristics.

Moving on to **section 3 (Parallel data preparation)**, I will look for mentions of parallel corpora used for training the translation models. The authors reference the **PL-EN Europarl v7 corpus** and the **OPUS OpenSubtitles'12 corpus**. I will gather the necessary details about these datasets as well.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **Speecon corpus**:
   > Dorota J Iskra, Beate Grosskopf, Krzysztof Marasek, Henk van den Heuvel, Frank Diehl, and Andreas Kiessling. *Speecon-speech databases for consumer devices: Database specification and validation*. In LREC, 2002.

2. **Europarl corpus**:
   > Philipp Koehn, Hieu Hoang, Alexandra Birch, Chris Callison-Burch, Marcello Federico, Nicola Bertoldi, Brooke Cowan, Wade Shen, Christine Moran, Richard Zens, et al. *Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the ACL on Interactive Poster and Demonstration Sessions. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2007, pp. 177-180.

3. **OpenSubtitles corpus**:
   > The OPUS project. *OpenSubtitles'12 corpus*. Available at: http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2012.php.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
