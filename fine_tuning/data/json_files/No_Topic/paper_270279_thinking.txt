To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Which portfolio is better? A new criterion for portfolio comparison" by Henryk Gzyl and Alfredo J. RÃ­os, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and experiments** to find any references to datasets. The abstract primarily discusses a new criterion for portfolio comparison but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **introduction**.

In the introduction, the authors discuss various portfolio comparison methods and cite several papers, but again, there are no explicit mentions of datasets. I will continue to the **main sections of the paper**, particularly focusing on any sections that might detail empirical analysis or experiments.

As I read through the sections, I will look for any references to data sources, datasets used for analysis, or any empirical results that rely on specific datasets. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to extract the full citation for those datasets as well.

If I find any datasets, I will document them carefully, ensuring to include:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future use or analysis.
