To extract datasets from the research paper titled "First do not fall: learning to exploit a wall with a damaged humanoid robot" by Timoth√©e Anne et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method, D-Refl ex, is based on a dataset created by simulating various situations and potential contact positions. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the **data collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they generated a dataset of 2000 tuples consisting of robot postures, wall configurations, and corresponding contact maps. They mention that the dataset was created through extensive simulations, which is crucial information.

The authors also provide details about the dataset's structure, including the random sampling of wall configurations and robot postures, as well as the creation of contact maps. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's content and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be generated by the authors themselves and may not have an external citation. The authors do mention that the source code and the dataset are available online, which is important for future reference.

Since the dataset is created through simulation, I will note that it is not a traditional dataset with a formal citation but rather a dataset generated for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: D-Refl ex Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of 2000 tuples containing robot postures, wall configurations, and corresponding contact maps, generated through simulations to train a neural network for fall avoidance in humanoid robots.
   - **Citation**: Anne, T., Dalin, E., Bergonzani, I., Ivaldi, S., & Mouret, J.-B. (2022). First do not fall: learning to exploit a wall with a damaged humanoid robot. In Robotics and Automation Letters.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for review or further processing.
