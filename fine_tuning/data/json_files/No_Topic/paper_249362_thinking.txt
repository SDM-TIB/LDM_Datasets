To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the application of transfer learning in prognostics and health management" by Ramin Moradi and Katrina M. Groth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses advancements in data availability and machine learning applications in fault diagnostics and prognostics, which may hint at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Transfer Learning in PHM)**, as it reviews existing studies that have utilized transfer learning in the context of prognostics and health management. This section is likely to contain references to specific datasets used in the studies being reviewed.

In **subsection 3.1 (Inductive TL)**, the authors mention the use of the **ImageNet dataset** for training deep convolutional networks. I will note this dataset and its relevance to the study.

In **subsection 3.3 (Unsupervised TL)**, the authors reference a study that uses healthy operational data from gas turbines, but they do not specify a particular dataset name. I will keep this in mind as it may be relevant for understanding the context of the research.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **References section**. For example, the **C-MAPSS datasets** are referenced in the context of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. I will ensure to extract the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

2. **C-MAPSS Datasets**: 
   > Ansi Zhang, Honglei Wang, Shaobo Li, Yuxin Cui, Zhonghao Liu, Guanci Yang, and Jianjun Hu. *Transfer learning with deep recurrent neural networks for remaining useful life estimation*. Applied Sciences, 8(12):2416, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
