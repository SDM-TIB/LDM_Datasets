To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bottom-Up 2D Pose Estimation via Dual Anatomical Centers for Small-Scale Persons" by Yu Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **COCO** dataset and the **OCHuman** dataset, indicating that these are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of multi-person pose estimation and mentions the COCO dataset as a benchmark, reinforcing its significance in the experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **COCO**, **OCHuman**, and **CrowdPose** datasets. I will take note of these datasets and their specific roles in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the evaluation metrics and how they assess performance on these datasets. They specifically mention using average precision (AP) metrics for COCO and OCHuman, which confirms their relevance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **COCO Dataset**:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

2. **OCHuman Dataset**:
   > S.-H. Zhang, R. Li, X. Dong, P. Rosin, Z. Cai, X. Han, D. Yang, H. Huang, S.-M. Hu. *Pose2seg: Detection Free Human Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 889–898.

3. **CrowdPose Dataset**:
   > J. Li, C. Wang, H. Zhu, Y. Mao, H.-S. Fang, C. Lu. *CrowdPose: Efficient Crowded Scenes Pose Estimation and a New Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 10863–10872.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
