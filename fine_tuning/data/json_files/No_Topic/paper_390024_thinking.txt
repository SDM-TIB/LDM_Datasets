To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond AUROC & co. for evaluating out-of-distribution detection performance" by Galadrielle Humblot-Renaux et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss OOD detection methods and their evaluation, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the importance of evaluating OOD detection methods. They reference various datasets indirectly, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They refer to several OOD datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 images.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.
4. **tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, Ontario, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, Ontario, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan S. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. Technical report, Stanford University, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
