To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the Gap Between SGP4 and High-Precision Propagation via Differentiable Programming" by Giacomo Acciarini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using **SpaceX Starlink Two-Line Elements (TLEs)** and **ephemeris data**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, structure, and the time period they cover.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the dataset comprising TLEs and ephemeris data for 1,519 Starlink satellites, collected from the 18th to the 21st of February 2023, with a time resolution of 60 seconds. This dataset is significant as it contains approximately 6.5 million rows and 6 columns, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the source of the TLE data as **Space-Track**, which is a public catalog for satellite data.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Space-Track. *Space-Track.org*. Accessed April 2023. [https://www.space-track.org/](https://www.space-track.org/).

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, including its description and citation.

1. **Dataset Name**: SpaceX Starlink TLEs
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising Two-Line Elements for 1,519 Starlink satellites, covering the period from February 18, 2023, to February 21, 2023, with a time resolution of 60 seconds. The dataset contains approximately 6.5 million rows and 6 columns (three for position and three for velocity).
   - **Citation**: Space-Track. *Space-Track.org*. Accessed April 2023. [https://www.space-track.org/](https://www.space-track.org/).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
