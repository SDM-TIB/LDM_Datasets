To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MDCN: Multi-Scale, Deep Inception Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Object Detection" by Wenchi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework is evaluated on the **KITTI dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically describe the **KITTI object detection dataset**. The authors explain that this dataset is designed for autonomous driving and contains challenging objects such as small and occluded cars, pedestrians, and cyclists. They mention that it consists of 7,481 images for training and validation, and 7,518 images for testing, with around 40,000 object labels classified based on occlusion and truncation levels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the KITTI dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the KITTI dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
