To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Î³ and C for (cid:15)-Support Vector Regression with RBF Kernels" by Longfei Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the study's objectives but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the use of (cid:15)-Support Vector Regression (SVR) but does not provide details about datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author describes the data used for testing the proposed methods. Here, it is stated that the experiments were performed using practice data from an energy company covering the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. This section indicates that the dataset consists of 15 different features related to energy consumption, but it does not provide a specific name for the dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name for the dataset used, I will refer to it as the **Energy Consumption Dataset** for the purpose of documentation. I will also note the time frame and the nature of the data (energy consumption features).

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily discuss methodologies and do not provide specific datasets or their citations.

Given that the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset used, I will create a placeholder citation for the **Energy Consumption Dataset** based on the information available:

- **Energy Consumption Dataset**: Data from an energy company covering the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, containing 15 different features related to energy consumption.

Since there are no formal citations provided in the paper for this dataset, I will note that the dataset is derived from practical data used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the details I have gathered about the dataset.
