To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for Intellectual Property Rights Protection on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Zhi Qin Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the **Experiments section** is crucial as it typically details the datasets used for validation of the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize experimental results, as they often reference the datasets directly.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets in the **Experiments section**:

1. **TREC-6 Dataset**: This dataset is used for text classification tasks. The authors reference it in the context of evaluating their model's performance on classification tasks.

2. **WMT14 EN-FR Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors mention it while discussing the performance of their model in translation experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **TREC-6 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., & Roth, D. (2002). Learning question classifiers. In *COLING*, pages 1–7, USA.

- For the **WMT14 EN-FR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., Buck, C., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Koehn, P., Leveling, J., Monz, C., Pecina, P., Post, M., Saint-Amand, H., Soricut, R., Specia, L., & Tamchyna, A. (2014). Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation. In *Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*, pages 12–58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
