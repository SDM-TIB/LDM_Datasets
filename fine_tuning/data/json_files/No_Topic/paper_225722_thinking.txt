To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Annotation Artifacts in Natural Language Inference Datasets to Improve Cross-dataset Generalization Ability" by Guanhua Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the focus on natural language inference (NLI) datasets and mentions the presence of annotation artifacts, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference two widely-used NLI datasets: **SNLI** and **MultiNLI**. They provide citations for these datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process. Additionally, they mention **SICK** and **JOCI** as datasets used for cross-dataset testing, indicating that I need to gather information about these as well.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Evaluation Scheme)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They confirm the use of:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference, created by crowd-sourcing.
   - Citation: 
     > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015.

2. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: Another large-scale NLI dataset that includes a diverse set of genres.
   - Citation: 
     > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), volume 1, pages 1112–1122, 2018.

3. **SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge)**: A dataset for evaluating compositional distributional semantic models.
   - Citation: 
     > Marco Marelli, Luisa Bentivogli, Marco Baroni, Raffaella Bernardi, Stefano Menini, and Roberto Zamparelli. *Semeval-2014 task 1: Evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models on full sentences through semantic relatedness and textual entailment*. In Proceedings of the 8th international workshop on semantic evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 1–8, 2014.

4. **JOCI (Judged Overlap of Contextual Inferences)**: A dataset created by pairing hypotheses and premises automatically, with human-generated labels.
   - Citation: 
     > Sheng Zhang, Rachel Rudinger, Kevin Duh, and Benjamin Van Durme. *Ordinal common-sense inference*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5:379–395, 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, including the context in which each dataset is used within the paper. This will help in providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
