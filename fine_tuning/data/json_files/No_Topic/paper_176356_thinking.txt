To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Material Recognition from Local Appearance in Global Context" by Gabriel Schwartz and Ko Nishino, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "recently introduced comprehensive and diverse material database," which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of material recognition and the need for a dataset that separates materials from context. They reference a dataset introduced by Schwartz and Nishino, which is likely the one they used for their experiments.

In the **related work section**, the authors mention several datasets, including the **Materials in Context (MINC) dataset** and the **Flickr Materials Database (FMD)**. I will take note of these datasets as they are relevant to the context of material recognition.

Moving to the **local material recognition section**, the authors describe their own dataset aimed at local material recognition, which includes images sourced from various databases, including PASCAL VOC, Microsoft COCO, FMD, and ImageNet. This indicates that they have created a new dataset based on these sources.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to confirm the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention that they extracted over 200,000 image patches from their dataset, which reinforces its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **Materials in Context (MINC) dataset**:
   > S. Bell, P. Upchurch, N. Snavely, and K. Bala. *Material Recognition in the Wild with the Materials in Context Database*. In CVPR, 2015.

2. **Flickr Materials Database (FMD)**:
   > L. Sharan, R. Rosenholtz, and E. Adelson. *Material Perception: What Can You See in a Brief Glance?* Journal of Vision, 9(8):784, 2009.

3. **PASCAL VOC dataset**:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, June 2010.

4. **Microsoft COCO dataset**:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Marie, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

5. **ImageNet dataset**:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
