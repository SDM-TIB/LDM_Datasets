To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Embeddable Implicit IUVD Representation for Part-based 3D Human Surface Reconstruction" by Baoxing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **THuman2.0 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they used the **THuman2.0 dataset** for training and evaluation. This dataset is described as a public dataset containing 526 high-quality textured scans of clothed humans and fitted SMPL models. This description provides essential details about the dataset's purpose and content.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the THuman2.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> T. Yu, Z. Zheng, K. Guo, P. Liu, Q. Dai, and Y. Liu. "Function4D: Real-time human volumetric capture from very sparse consumer RGBD sensors." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2021, pp. 5742â€“5752.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the THuman2.0 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the THuman2.0 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, containing the necessary dataset information and citations.
