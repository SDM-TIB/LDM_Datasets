To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Optical Experiments Modeled by Long Short-Term Memory" by Thomas Adler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the use of machine learning to model quantum experiments, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the training process.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly subsection 3.1 titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the dataset produced by MELVIN, which consists of 7,853,853 different setups, with 1,638,233 samples labeled as positive. This is a clear indication of a significant dataset used in their experiments.

In this section, I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of setups and the labeling of samples. The authors describe the dataset as containing sequences of optical elements and target values for entanglement classification and Schmidt rank vector (SRV) regression.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MELVIN dataset. Since the dataset is generated by the algorithm MELVIN, I will look for the original paper that describes MELVIN. The relevant citation is:

- For the MELVIN dataset, the citation is:
  > Krenn, M., Malik, M., Fickler, R., Lapkiewicz, R., & Zeilinger, A. (2016). Automated Search for new Quantum Experiments. *Phys. Rev. Lett.*, 116(090405).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
