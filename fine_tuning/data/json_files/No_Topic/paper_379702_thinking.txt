To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiscoVars: A New Data Analysis Perspective - Application in Variable Selection for Clustering" by Ayhan Demiriz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction elaborates on the importance of variable selection and may mention specific datasets or domains where the proposed methodology is applied.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the author discusses the application of DiscoVars on two real datasets: anthropometric data and cryptocurrency market data. I will note the specific datasets used within these domains.

In the **methodology** section, the author mentions using anthropometric surveys on US military personnel and cryptocurrency market data collected from a specific source. I will need to extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **conclusions** and **bibliography** sections for any references to datasets or studies that may provide additional context or citations. The bibliography may contain references to the original sources of the datasets mentioned.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Ansur Dataset**: This dataset consists of anthropometric measurements from US military personnel. The paper references two different datasets: "Ansur Men" and "Ansur Women," which are used for variable selection.

2. **Cryptocurrency Market Data**: The paper discusses two sets of cryptocurrency data, referred to as "Coin I" and "Coin II," which include daily return rates of various cryptocurrencies.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper and any additional sources referenced:

- For the **Ansur Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Army Anthropometric Survey. *Ansur Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openlab.psu.edu/ansur/

- For the **Cryptocurrency Market Data**, the citation is:
  > CoinMarketCap. *Cryptocurrency Market Data*. Available at: https://coinmarketcap.com/

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations, to prepare for the structured output. This will involve summarizing the key points and ensuring that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in the final dataset entries.
