To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme Point Pursuitâ€”Part I: A Framework for Constant Modulus Optimization" by Junbin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely for detailed descriptions. This section may provide information about the size, type, and source of each dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of its contents and purpose.
3. The full citation as it appears in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively.
