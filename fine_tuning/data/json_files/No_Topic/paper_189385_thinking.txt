To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Totalizer Encoding for Pseudo-Boolean Constraints" by Saurabh Joshi, Ruben Martins, and Vasco Manquinho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Implementation and Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention that they evaluated their encoding on two sets of benchmarks: the **PB’12 benchmarks** and the **pedigree benchmarks**. I will look for any specific details about these benchmarks, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant citations.

In the **tables presented in section 4**, I will find descriptions of the benchmarks. For instance, the paper mentions that the PB’12 benchmarks consist of 355 instances from the DEC-SMALLINT-LIN category, and the pedigree benchmarks are derived from computational biology problems. I will note the specific characteristics and any relevant statistics provided in the tables.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The PB’12 benchmarks are referenced as being available at a specific URL, and the pedigree benchmarks are also linked to a resource. I will ensure to capture these citations accurately.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **PB’12 benchmarks**:
  > Available at: http://sat.inesc-id.pt/~ruben/benchmarks/pb12-subset.zip

- For the **pedigree benchmarks**:
  > Available at: http://sat.inesc-id.pt/~ruben/benchmarks/pedigrees.zip

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
