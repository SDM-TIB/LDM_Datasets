To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deriving Language Models from Masked Language Models" by Lucas Torroba Hennigen and Yoon Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the evaluation of methods derived from masked language models (MLMs). The introduction also does not specify datasets but refers to the need for evaluation metrics, which may imply the use of datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **evaluation** section (section 3) where the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments: **SNLI** and **XSUM**. The authors state that they compute metrics on 1000 examples from these datasets, which indicates their significance in the research.

In the **results** section (section 4), the authors present a comparison of various methods using these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces the idea that both SNLI and XSUM are critical datasets for the findings presented in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, Lisbon, Portugal, 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For the **XSUM dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **SNLI**: A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference, consisting of sentence pairs labeled with entailment relationships.
- **XSUM**: A dataset for extreme summarization, containing news articles paired with single-sentence summaries.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
