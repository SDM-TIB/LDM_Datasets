To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Incidência Final dos Tributos Indiretos no Brasil: Estimativa Usando a Matriz de Insumo-Produto 2015" by Rozane Bezerra de Siqueira et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and references sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on estimating the final incidence of indirect taxes in Brazil using the 2015 input-output matrix, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of the **Matriz de Insumo-Produto do Brasil 2015 (IBGE, 2018)** as the primary dataset for their analysis. This is a crucial dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look into the **method section**, where the authors describe how they utilize the input-output matrix to estimate tax incidence. They reference the matrix produced by the Instituto Brasileiro de Estatística (IBGE), which confirms its importance in their methodology.

In the **results section**, the authors present various tables that summarize the findings based on the input-output matrix, but they do not introduce new datasets. Instead, they analyze the data from the matrix to derive insights about tax incidence.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- **Matriz de Insumo-Produto do Brasil 2015**:
  > IBGE (2018). *Matriz de Insumo-Produto: Brasil 2015*. Rio de Janeiro: IBGE.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
