To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Lifelong Topic Model and Manifold Ranking for Document Summarization" by Jianying Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on four datasets in section 5.1. I will carefully read this section to identify the names and descriptions of each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DUC 2005**: This dataset is used for query-focused multi-document summarization and consists of documents from the news domain. It contains 50 topics, with each topic having a varying number of documents.

2. **DUC 2006**: Similar to DUC 2005, this dataset is also for multi-document summarization and includes 32 topics.

3. **DUC 2007**: This dataset continues the trend of multi-document summarization with 50 topics.

4. **NLPCC 2015**: This dataset is used for single-document summarization and consists of documents from Chinese news articles posted on Sina Weibo.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DUC 2005**:
  > Dang, H. T. (2005). Overview of DUC 2005. In Proceedings of the Document Understanding Conference, 2005, pp. 1-12.

- For **DUC 2006**:
  > Dang, H. T. (2006). Overview of DUC 2006. In Proceedings of the Document Understanding Conference, 2006, pp. 1-12.

- For **DUC 2007**:
  > Dang, H. T. (2007). Overview of DUC 2007. In Proceedings of the Document Understanding Conference, 2007, pp. 1-12.

- For **NLPCC 2015**:
  > Liu, M., Wang, L., and Nie, L. (2015). Weibo-oriented Chinese news summarization via multi-feature combination. In Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing, pp. 581-589. Springer, Cham.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
