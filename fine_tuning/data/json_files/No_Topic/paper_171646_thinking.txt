To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Paraphrase for Question Answering" by Li Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on three datasets, which suggests that I should find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used for training their model. They mention three specific datasets:

1. **WEBQUESTIONS**: This dataset contains 3,778 training instances and 2,032 test instances. It was created by querying the Google Suggest API and crowd-sourcing answers using Freebase.

2. **GRAPHQUESTIONS**: This dataset consists of 5,166 question-answer pairs, evenly split into training and test sets. It was generated by asking crowd workers to paraphrase 500 Freebase graph queries into natural language.

3. **WIKIQA**: This dataset includes 3,047 questions sampled from Bing query logs, associated with 29,258 candidate answer sentences, of which 1,473 contain the correct answers.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WEBQUESTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Berant, Andrew Chou, Roy Frostig, and Percy Liang. *Semantic parsing on Freebase from question-answer pairs*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533–1544, Seattle, Washington, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **GRAPHQUESTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Yu Su, Huan Sun, Brian Sadler, Mudhakar Srivatsa, Izzeddin Gur, Zenghui Yan, and Xifeng Yan. *On generating characteristic-rich question sets for QA evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 562–572, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **WIKIQA**, the citation is:
  > Yi Yang, Wen-tau Yih, and Christopher Meek. *WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2013–2018, Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
