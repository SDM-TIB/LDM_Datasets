To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Leaf Segmentation under Complex Lighting Conditions" by Xufeng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on datasets of different plant species, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Cannabis Dataset**: This dataset consists of images captured under different lighting conditions (Natural, Yellow, and Purple) and includes 300 images for training and 40 images for testing under each condition.

2. **CVPPP Leaf Segmentation Challenge (LSC) Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing multiple subsets (A1, A2, A3, A4) with images of different plant species, which were used to evaluate the performance of their segmentation method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about how these datasets were utilized, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cannabis Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Lin, X., Li, C.-T., Adams, S., Kouzani, A., Jiang, R., He, L., Hu, Y., Vernon, M., Doeven, E., Webb, L., McClellan, T., Guskich, A. *Self-Supervised Leaf Segmentation under Complex Lighting Conditions*. Preprint submitted to Journal of LATEX Templates, March 31, 2022.

- For the **CVPPP Leaf Segmentation Challenge (LSC) Dataset**, I will cite it based on the original paper that introduced it:
  > Minervini, M., Fischbach, A., Scharr, H., Tsaftaris, S. A. *Finely-grained annotated datasets for image-based plant phenotyping*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 81, 80â€“89, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
