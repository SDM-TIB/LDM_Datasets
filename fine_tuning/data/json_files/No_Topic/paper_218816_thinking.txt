To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proximal Reliability Optimization for Reinforcement Learning" by Narendra Patwardhan and Zequn Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the tasks and environments used for their experiments. Here, they mention two classical control problems: **Cart-Pole balancing** and **Inverted Pendulum**. I will look for any datasets or environments associated with these tasks.

In the **task descriptions** subsection, the authors provide details about the Cart-Pole balancing and Inverted Pendulum tasks, including the parameters and conditions under which the experiments were conducted. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets; instead, they describe the simulation environments created for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes the environments used for testing their proposed method, I will note that the datasets are essentially the simulation environments created for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the environments or methods used in the experiments. The references primarily cite previous works related to reinforcement learning and control methods, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets but rather describes the experimental environments, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Cart-Pole Balancing Environment**: A simulation environment where the goal is to keep a pendulum balanced on a cart. The parameters include the mass of the cart and pole, the length of the pole, and the control forces applied.

2. **Inverted Pendulum Environment**: A simulation environment where the objective is to keep a freely swinging pendulum vertical. The parameters include the mass, length, and control efforts.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations, I will note that the environments are based on standard reinforcement learning tasks commonly used in the literature.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the environments used in the experiments, but I will not be able to provide formal citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned in the paper.
