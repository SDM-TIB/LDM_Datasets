To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STaR: Self-supervised Tracking and Reconstruction of Rigid Objects in Motion with Neural Rendering" by Wentao Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they created for evaluation:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors created two synthetic videos using Blender:
   - **Lamp and Desk**: A 15-frame video showing a chair being pulled away from a desk in a study room.
   - **Kitchen Table**: A 20-frame video showing a vase sliding across a reflective breakfast bar in a kitchen.

2. **Real World Data**: The authors captured a multi-view video titled **Moving Banana** in a natural indoor environment. This dataset consists of 17 time-synchronized videos with a total of 792 temporal frames, featuring a moving banana toy on a robot vacuum.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. Since the synthetic datasets were created by the authors themselves, I will note that they are original datasets without external citations. For the real-world dataset, I will check if there are any references to prior works or methods used in capturing the data, but it appears to be an original capture as well.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Lamp and Desk**: Original dataset created by the authors using Blender.
- **Kitchen Table**: Original dataset created by the authors using Blender.
- **Moving Banana**: Original dataset captured by the authors in a real-world setting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is documented clearly and accurately for future reference or processing.
