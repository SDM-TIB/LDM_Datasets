To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Design by Reinforcement Learning: Enhancing the Diversity of Topology Optimization Designs" by Seowoo Jang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context and background of their research. This section may contain references to existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experiments or data collection processes. This is where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for training and validation, including any specific characteristics or sizes of the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using a total of **639 reference images** obtained through web crawling on a wheel selling website, specifically **Tire Rack**. They divide these images into two sets: **500 for training** and **139 for validation**. This indicates that the dataset is comprised of images related to automotive wheel designs.

Next, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were processed or any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of their models on these datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are mentioned. In this case, the authors reference the Tire Rack website as the source of their dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset is as follows:
- **Dataset**: Wheel Design Dataset
  > Tire Rack. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.tirerack.com/content/tirerack/desktop/en/wheels.html

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
