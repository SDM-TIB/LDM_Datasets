To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MAESTRO: Matched Speech Text Representations through Modality Matching" by Zhehuai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors establish a new state-of-the-art on several tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

In **subsection 4.1 (Pre-training Data)**, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **LibriLight corpus**: This dataset is used for monolingual ASR pre-training and consists of unlabeled English-only speech.

2. **TEDLIUM**: This dataset is referenced as the unspoken text corpus, which includes text data for training.

3. **Librispeech**: Another text corpus mentioned for unspoken text.

4. **SpeechStew**: This is identified as the labeled, paired speech and text corpus used for training.

5. **VoxPopuli**: This dataset is used for multilingual ASR models and consists of 429k hours of public unlabeled speech.

6. **CommonVoice**: Another dataset mentioned for multilingual ASR, contributing to the training data.

7. **MLS**: This dataset is also part of the multilingual ASR training data.

8. **BABEL**: Included in the multilingual ASR training data.

9. **CoVoST**: Specifically, the CoVoST 21 languages to English ST corpus is used for speech translation tasks.

In **subsection 4.2 (Architecture Details)**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets are utilized in their model architecture.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
