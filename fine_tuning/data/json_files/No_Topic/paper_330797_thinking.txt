To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformal Prediction Sets with Limited False Positives" by Adam Fisch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method across various classification tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three specific tasks: in-silico screening for drug discovery, object detection, and entity extraction. Each of these tasks likely corresponds to a dataset.

1. **ChEMBL Dataset**: This dataset is used for the in-silico screening task. The authors describe it as a molecular property screening task where they identify molecules that satisfy specific constraints. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mayr, A., Klambauer, G., Unterthiner, T., Steijaert, M., Wegner, J., Ceulemans, H., Clevert, D.-A., & Hochreiter, S. (2018). Large-scale comparison of machine learning methods for drug target prediction on ChEMBL. *Chemical Science*, 9(24), 6101-6111.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the object detection task. The authors mention that it contains images of everyday scenes with various object categories. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (pp. 740-755).

3. **CoNLL NER Dataset**: This dataset is used for the entity extraction task. The authors describe it as a dataset for identifying named entities in sentences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In *Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003* (pp. 142-147).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ready for further processing or review.
