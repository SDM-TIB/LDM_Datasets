To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Optimal Tree Models under Beam Search" by Jingwei Zhuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) to find detailed information about the datasets used. The authors mention conducting experiments on two large-scale real datasets for recommendation tasks: **Amazon Books** and **User-Behavior**. I will note down these names as they are explicitly mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of the datasets:
1. **Amazon Books**: This dataset is used for recommendation tasks and is referenced to previous works (McAuley et al., 2015; He & McAuley, 2016).
2. **User-Behavior**: Another dataset used for recommendation tasks, also referenced to Zhu et al. (2018).

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. 

For **Amazon Books**, the citation is:
> McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., and Van Den Hengel, A. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 43–52, 2015.

For **User-Behavior**, the citation is:
> Zhu, H., Li, X., Zhang, P., Li, G., He, J., Li, H., and Gai, K. *Learning tree-based deep model for recommender systems*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pp. 1079–1088. ACM, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
