To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Informal Introduction to Multiplet Neural Networks" by Nathan E. Frick, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

Next, I will look for any sections that specifically discuss datasets or experiments. In this paper, there is a mention of the **MNIST dataset** in section 5.1, where the author describes a nearest neighbor search test using this dataset. This indicates that the MNIST dataset is used for evaluation purposes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C.J. "The MNIST database of handwritten digits." 2012. [Online].

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the MNIST dataset as the key dataset used in the paper, and I have retrieved its full citation for proper documentation.
