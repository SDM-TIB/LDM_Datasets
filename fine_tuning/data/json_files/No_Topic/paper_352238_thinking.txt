To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning Exploration of Transition Metal Complexes to Discover Method-Insensitive and Synthetically Accessible Chromophores" by Chenru Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or databases that are foundational to their work. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets that are critical for the study.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including how they were obtained, any preprocessing steps, and the specific characteristics of the datasets. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant citations.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets, especially if the authors present findings based on specific data analyses or comparisons. I will note any datasets referenced here, particularly if they are linked to the results being discussed.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. This is essential for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)**: This database is mentioned as a source for synthetically accessible fragments and ligand symmetries. The citation for the CSD is:
   > Allen, F. H. *The Cambridge Structural Database: A Quarter of a Million Crystal Structures and Rising*. Acta Crystallographica Section B: Structural Science, 2002, 58(3), 380-388.

2. **Data from Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations**: The paper discusses using DFT calculations with various density functional approximations (DFAs) but does not specify a single dataset. Instead, it refers to the results generated from these calculations. The citation for the foundational work on DFT is:
   > Kohn, W., & Sham, L. J. *Self-Consistent Equations Including Exchange and Correlation Effects*. Physical Review, 1965, 140(4A), A1133-A1138.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: The authors mention using machine learning models trained on data derived from DFT calculations. While specific datasets are not named, the methodology is based on previously established datasets. A relevant citation for machine learning in this context is:
   > Duan, C., et al. *Machine Learning to Tame Divergent Density Functional Approximations: A New Path to Consensus Materials Design Principles*. Chem. Sci., 2021, 12(39), 13021-13036.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review.
