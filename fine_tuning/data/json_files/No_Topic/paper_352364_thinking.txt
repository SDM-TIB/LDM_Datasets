To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessments in Education" by Hans Henrik Sievertsen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's focus on assessments in education, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the body of the text.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. I will pay close attention to any studies or analyses that cite specific datasets, as these will be crucial for my extraction.

In the paper, I find that the author references several studies that utilize datasets. For example, in the section discussing the effects of assessments, the author mentions the **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**, which is a significant dataset used to evaluate educational systems worldwide. 

Additionally, the author cites **Borghans et al. (2016)**, which discusses four datasets representing individuals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, including results from IQ measures, standardized tests, school grades, and personality tests. This is another important dataset to document.

I will also check the **references section** to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are as follows:

1. **PISA Dataset**:
   > Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). *PISA 2018 Results (Volume I): What Students Know and Can Do*. OECD Publishing, Paris, 2019.

2. **Borghans et al. (2016)**:
   > Borghans, Lex, Bart HH Golsteyn, James J Heckman, and John Eric Humphries. “What grades and achievement tests measure.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(47): 13354–13359, 2016.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and correctly formatted for future reference or analysis.
