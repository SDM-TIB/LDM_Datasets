To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FeTrIL++: Feature Translation for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning with Hill-Climbing" by Eduard Hogea et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted on **CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and an ImageNet-Subset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. The introduction mentions that the authors conducted experiments across multiple challenging datasets, confirming that these datasets are indeed used for evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the methods applied to each dataset, which further confirms their relevance. They specifically mention that CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet each contain 500 images, while the ImageNet-Subset contains 1500 images. This information is useful for understanding the scale of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset, but I can reference the commonly accepted sources for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

3. **ImageNet-Subset**: This is typically derived from the larger ImageNet dataset, so I will cite the original ImageNet paper:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in research.
