To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFRC with Improved Communication-Sensing Trade-off via Private Subcarrier Permutations and Pairing with Antennas" by Zhaoyi Xu and Athina P. Petropulu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on dual function radar communication systems, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the context and significance of DFRC systems but does not seem to mention specific datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for validation or testing. In this paper, there are no explicit datasets mentioned in these sections. Instead, the authors focus on the proposed algorithms and their performance metrics.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets directly, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may contain datasets relevant to the study. The references include various papers that may have datasets related to radar communication systems, but I need to ensure that they are indeed datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite their previous work, which may contain relevant datasets. Specifically, I will look at the reference:

- Xu, Z., & Petropulu, A. (2021). "A wideband dual function radar communication system with sparse array and OFDM waveforms." This paper may provide insights into datasets used in their previous experiments.

However, since the current paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that while the authors discuss their methods and results, they do not provide specific datasets or their citations in this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize that this paper does not contain explicit datasets, and I will reference the relevant citation from their previous work for potential dataset information.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
