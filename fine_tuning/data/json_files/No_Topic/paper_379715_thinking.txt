To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motion Capture Benchmark of Real Industrial Tasks and Traditional Crafts for Human Movement Analysis" by Brenda Elizabeth Olivas-Padilla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper presents **seven datasets recorded using inertial-based motion capture**, which indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific mentions of the datasets. The introduction discusses the need for systematic evaluations of human movement data and mentions various motion capture initiatives, but I need to find the specific datasets used in this study.

I will then focus on the **data acquisition** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section outlines the motion capture technology used and the subjects involved, as well as the specific gestures recorded for each dataset. I will look for a table or list that summarizes the datasets, including their names, activities recorded, and any relevant details.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **TVA (Television Assembly)**: Recorded gestures related to assembling televisions in a factory setting.
2. **TVP (Television Packaging)**: Captured gestures related to packaging televisions.
3. **APA (Airplane Floater Assembly)**: Involves gestures related to assembling airplane components.
4. **ERGD (Ergonomic Risk Level Postures)**: Contains various postures recorded to assess ergonomic risks.
5. **SLW (Silk Weaving)**: Captured gestures of a skilled silk weaver in a workshop.
6. **GLB (Glass Blowing)**: Involves gestures related to the creation of glass decanters.
7. **MSC (Mastic Cultivation)**: Captured gestures related to the cultivation of mastic.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. The paper may not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it will likely reference the original sources or related works that describe the datasets or methodologies used.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **TVA**, I will cite the relevant source that describes the television assembly process.
- For **TVP**, I will find the citation related to the packaging process.
- For **APA**, I will look for the citation that discusses the airplane assembly tasks.
- For **ERGD**, I will reference the source that outlines the ergonomic risk assessment methods.
- For **SLW**, I will find the citation related to silk weaving.
- For **GLB**, I will look for the citation that discusses glassblowing techniques.
- For **MSC**, I will find the citation related to mastic cultivation.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly articulated, including the activity recorded, the number of subjects, and the context in which the data was collected, along with the full citation for each dataset. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets for future reference or analysis.
