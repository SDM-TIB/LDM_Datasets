To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Imitation Learning in Minecraft" by Artemij Amiranashvili et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors report experiments using a large-scale expert demonstration dataset provided by Guss et al. (2019b). This indicates that there is a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly the part discussing the **Minecraft environment** and the **demonstration dataset**. Here, the authors specifically mention the **MineRL-v0 dataset**, which contains over 500 hours of human trajectories for various tasks in Minecraft, including the ObtainIronPickaxe task. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **Results** section, the authors discuss their performance in the MineRL competition and reference the use of the MineRL-v0 dataset again, confirming its importance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MineRL-v0 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MineRL-v0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guss, W. H., Houghton, B., Topin, N., Wang, P., Codel, C., Veloso, M., and Salakhutdinov, R. (2019b). MineRL: a large-scale dataset of Minecraft demonstrations. In International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).

Since the authors also mention the **ObtainIronPickaxe** and **Treechop** tasks, I will note that these tasks are part of the larger dataset but do not require separate citations as they are not standalone datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MineRL-v0 dataset, which is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methods and results sections for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Locate the full citation in the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
