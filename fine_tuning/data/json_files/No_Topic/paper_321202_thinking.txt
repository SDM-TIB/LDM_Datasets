To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Lightweight Controllable Audio Synthesis with Conditional Implicit Neural Representations" by Jan Zuiderveld et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the use of Conditional Implicit Neural Representations (CINRs) for audio synthesis and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 5 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **NSYNTH Keyboard**: This dataset consists of 1 second, 1024 item keyboard waveforms in MIDI notes [60, 64]. It is balanced for note counts and recorded at a sampling rate of 16kHz.

2. **NSYNTH Diverse**: This dataset includes 1 second, 1024 item waveforms from keyboard, mallet, and guitar instruments in MIDI notes [24, 84]. It is balanced for note- and instrument counts and recorded at a sampling rate of 16kHz.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the NSYNTH dataset. The NSYNTH dataset is referenced in the paper as follows:

- For the NSYNTH dataset, the citation is:
  > Jesse Engel, Cinjon Resnick, Adam Roberts, Sander Dieleman, Douglas Eck, Karen Simonyan, and Mohammad Norouzi. *Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders*. arXiv: 1704.01279 [cs]. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01279.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets:

1. **NSYNTH Keyboard**: 
   - Description: 1 second, 1024 item keyboard waveforms in MIDI notes [60, 64], balanced for note counts, recorded at a sampling rate of 16kHz.
   - Citation: Engel et al. (2017). *Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders*. arXiv: 1704.01279 [cs]. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01279.

2. **NSYNTH Diverse**: 
   - Description: 1 second, 1024 item waveforms from keyboard, mallet, and guitar instruments in MIDI notes [24, 84], balanced for note- and instrument counts, recorded at a sampling rate of 16kHz.
   - Citation: Engel et al. (2017). *Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet Autoencoders*. arXiv: 1704.01279 [cs]. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01279.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
