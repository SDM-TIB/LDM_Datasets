To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-To-End Anomaly Detection for Identifying Malicious Cyber Behavior through NLP-Based Log Embeddings" by Andrew Golczynski and John A. Emanuello, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **DARPA OpTC dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in identifying malicious cyber behavior and mention the need for quality benchmark datasets. This reinforces the importance of the dataset they are using.

In the **data section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **DARPA Operationally Transparent Computing (OpTC) dataset**. They explain that this dataset consists of network and host logging collected from a network of Windows hosts over a one-week period, including both benign user activity and red team activities. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DARPA OpTC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **DARPA OpTC Dataset**:
  > DARPA. Operationally Transparent Cyber (OpTC) Data Release, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
