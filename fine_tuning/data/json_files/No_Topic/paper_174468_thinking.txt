To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Epistemic Logic with Functional Dependency Operator" by Yifeng Ding, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and experiments** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various concepts related to epistemic logic but does not mention any datasets. I will continue to the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Preliminaries)** and **section 3 (Full Domain of Functions)**, as these sections may contain examples or references to datasets used in the context of the proposed logic. However, these sections primarily focus on theoretical constructs and do not provide any specific datasets.

I will also check **section 4 (Minimal Function Domain)** and **section 5 (Intermediate Function Domain)**, which discuss different function domains and their implications for the logic. Again, these sections do not mention any datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and do not indicate any specific datasets used in the research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Since I have not identified any datasets, there will be no citations to compile. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their full citations as per the requirements.

In summary, I will note that this paper does not include any datasets for extraction.
