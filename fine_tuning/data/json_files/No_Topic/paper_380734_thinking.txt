To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical Differentially Private and Byzantine-resilient Federated Learning" by Zihang Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations. If the authors discuss their methodology or results, they may reference specific datasets that are critical to their findings.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which usually details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for sections that describe the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE* 86.11 (1998): 2278-2324.

2. **Colorectal Dataset**: A dataset containing histological images for colorectal cancer classification, with 5,000 images.
   - Citation: Jakob Nikolas Kather et al. "Multi-class texture analysis in colorectal cancer histology." *Scientific Reports* 6.1 (2016): 1-11.

3. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: A dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, similar to MNIST but with clothing items.
   - Citation: Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

4. **USPS Dataset**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 7,291 training samples and 2,007 testing samples.
   - Citation: Jonathan J. Hull. "A database for handwritten text recognition research." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* 16.5 (1994): 550-554.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
