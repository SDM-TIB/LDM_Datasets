To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drift Estimation with Graphical Models" by Luigi Riso and Marco Guerzoni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper evaluates the method with real-world data on the Australian Electric market, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ELEC2 dataset** for their empirical experiment. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it is used.

In the **empirical experiment section**, the authors describe the ELEC2 dataset in detail, stating that it contains 27,552 records from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, with each record referring to a 30-minute period and including a binary class label and four covariates. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ELEC2 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **ELEC2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael Harries. *Splice-2 Comparative Evaluation: Electricity Pricing*. PANDORA electronic collection. University of New South Wales, School of Computer Science and Engineering, 1999. URL: https://books.google.it/books?id=1Zr1vQAACAAJ.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
