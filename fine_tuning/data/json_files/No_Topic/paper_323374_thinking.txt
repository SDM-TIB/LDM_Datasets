To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keeping it Simple: Language Models can learn Complex Molecular Distributions" by Daniel Flam-Shepherd et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce several generative modeling tasks by compiling complex distributions of molecules, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors describe three specific tasks: the Penalized LogP Task, the Multi-distribution Task, and the Large Scale Task. Each task is likely associated with a distinct dataset.

1. **Penalized LogP Task**: The authors state that they built a training dataset by screening the **ZINC15 database** for molecules with penalized LogP scores exceeding 4.0. They mention that this dataset contains approximately 160,000 molecules.

2. **Multi-distribution Task**: For this task, the authors created a dataset by combining subsets from four sources:
   - **GDB13**: Molecules with molecular weight (MW) ≤ 185.
   - **ZINC**: Molecules with 185 ≤ MW ≤ 425.
   - **Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP)**: Molecules with 460 ≤ MW ≤ 600.
   - **POLYMERS**: Molecules with MW ≥ 600.
   The total training dataset for this task consists of around 200,000 molecules.

3. **Large Scale Task**: The authors utilized the **PubChem database** to screen for the largest molecules with more than 100 heavy atoms, resulting in a dataset of 300,000 molecules.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ZINC15 database**, the citation is:
  > J. J. Irwin and B. K. Shoichet. "Zinc - a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening." *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* 45, 177 (2005).

- For **GDB13**, the citation is:
  > L. C. Blum and J.-L. Reymond. "970 million druglike small molecules for virtual screening in the chemical universe database GDB-13." *Journal of the American Chemical Society* 131, 8732 (2009).

- For the **Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP)**, the citation is:
  > J. Hachmann et al. "The Harvard Clean Energy Project: large-scale computational screening and design of organic photovoltaics on the world community grid." *The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters* 2, 2241 (2011).

- For **PubChem**, the citation is:
  > S. Kim et al. "PubChem substance and compound databases." *Nucleic Acids Research* 44, D1202 (2016).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
