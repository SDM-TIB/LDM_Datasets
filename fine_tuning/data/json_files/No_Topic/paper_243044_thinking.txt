To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCN-RL Circuit Designer: Transferable Transistor Sizing with Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning" by Hanrui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning and graph convolutional networks for transistor sizing, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the circuits they tested. They mention applying their method to four real-world circuits: 

1. **Two-stage transimpedance amplifier (Two-TIA)**
2. **Two-stage voltage amplifier (Two-Volt)**
3. **Three-stage transimpedance amplifier (Three-TIA)**
4. **Low-dropout regulator (LDO)**

While these are not datasets in the traditional sense, they represent the experimental setups used to validate the authors' approach. I will need to check if the paper provides any references to datasets or simulation environments used for these experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the circuits and the parameters they optimized, but they do not provide specific datasets. Instead, they refer to the use of commercial tools like Cadence Spectre and Synopsys Hspice for circuit simulation, which indicates that the data generated during these simulations is part of their experimental results.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets or if they reference any publicly available datasets. However, the references primarily cite previous works related to circuit design and optimization methods rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will summarize the experimental setups as follows:

1. **Two-stage transimpedance amplifier (Two-TIA)**: Designed in commercial 180nm TSMC technology, simulated with Cadence Spectre.
2. **Two-stage voltage amplifier (Two-Volt)**: Also designed in 180nm technology, simulated with Cadence Spectre.
3. **Three-stage transimpedance amplifier (Three-TIA)**: Designed in 180nm technology, simulated with Synopsys Hspice.
4. **Low-dropout regulator (LDO)**: Designed in 180nm technology, simulated with Cadence Spectre.

For each of these setups, I will note that they are based on proprietary simulation tools rather than publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the experimental setups and their respective citations:

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it describes experimental setups that are critical for understanding the application of the proposed method. I will ensure to document these setups and their citations accurately.
