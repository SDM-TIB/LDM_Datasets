To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Water Stress on U.S. Power Production at Decadal Time Horizons" by Auroop R. Ganguly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a summary of the study's focus on water stress and power production, which suggests that relevant datasets may be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **Chapter 2 (Data and Methodology)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their analysis. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to climate data, hydrologic data, population data, and power plant data. 

In this chapter, the authors mention several key datasets:

1. **Climate Model Data**: They utilize data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for precipitation and evapotranspiration. The specific models mentioned are:
   - CCSM4 (Community Climate System Model, version four)
   - GISS-E2H (Goddard Institute Space Studies Model E)
   - MIROC5 (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5)

   The citation for the CMIP5 data is:
   > Taylor, K.E., Stouffer, R.J., Meehl, G.A. (2012). An overview of CMIP5 and the experiment design. *Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc.*, 93, 485â€“498.

2. **Hydrologic Data**: The authors mention using historical stream temperature data from the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) for 18 major hydrologic units. The citation for this data source is:
   > U.S. Geological Survey. (n.d.). National Water Information System. Available at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis.

3. **Population Data**: They reference projected population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to estimate future water demand. The citation is:
   > U.S. Census Bureau. (n.d.). Population Projections. Available at: https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html.

4. **Power Plant Data**: The authors compiled spatial locations and capacities of thermoelectric power plants from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The citations for these sources are:
   > Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). (2011). Water use for electricity generation and other sectors: recent changes (1985 - 2005) and future projections (2005-2030).
   > Energy Information Administration (EIA). (2013). Form EIA-860 detailed data. Available at: http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper documentation and referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for review or further processing.
