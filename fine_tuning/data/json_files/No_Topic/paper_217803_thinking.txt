To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auditory Separation of a Conversation from Background via Attentional Gating" by Shariq Mobin and Bruno Olshausen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its evaluation, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction may give context about the datasets used, especially if they are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **LibriSpeech dataset** for their experiments. They detail the specific portions of the dataset utilized:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: 
   - **Train-clean-360**: Contains 360 hours of clean speech data spread over 916 speakers, referred to as well-known speakers.
   - **Test-clean**: Contains data from 40 speakers, referred to as new speakers.

The authors also describe how they split the data into training and evaluation sets for both well-known and new speakers, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **LibriSpeech Dataset**:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: 
   - Description: A large corpus of read English speech, used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks.
   - Specific Portions Used: 
     - Train-clean-360 (360 hours of clean speech data from 916 speakers)
     - Test-clean (data from 40 speakers)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
