To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Cross-level Requirement Traceability: A Novel Approach Integrating Bag-of-Words and Word Embedding for Enhanced Similarity Functionality" by Baher Mohammad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three well-known datasets: COEST, WARC(NFR), and WARC(FRS)**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed method.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **MODIS**: A dataset from NASA that includes high-level and low-level requirements. The authors provide some statistics about the dataset, including the number of links between requirements.

2. **WARC(NFR)**: This dataset is used for non-functional requirements, with specific counts of high-level and low-level requirements and the number of links.

3. **WARC(FRS)**: Similar to WARC(NFR), this dataset is focused on functional requirements and also includes statistics on the number of requirements and links.

The authors provide a table (Table 2) summarizing the descriptions and statistics of these datasets, which will be useful for extracting detailed information.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are publicly available, and it provides URLs for accessing them:

- For **MODIS**, the citation is:
  > Promise. *MODIS Dataset*. Available at: http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html.

- For **WARC(NFR)** and **WARC(FRS)**, the citation is:
  > COEST. *WARC(NFR) and WARC(FRS) Datasets*. Available at: http://sarec.nd.edu/coest/datasets.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
