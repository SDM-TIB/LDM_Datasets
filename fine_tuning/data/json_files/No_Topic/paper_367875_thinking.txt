To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TruFor: Leveraging all-round clues for trustworthy image forgery detection and localization" by Fabrizio Guillaro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. In the results section, the authors mention benchmarking their model on seven publicly available datasets and one dataset created by them. This is a strong indication that the datasets will be explicitly listed.

I will look for a section that discusses the datasets used for training and testing. In the supplementary document, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets in **Table 8**. Here, they mention:

1. **CASIA v2**: A dataset containing 7,491 real images and 51,000 fake images, used for various manipulation tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Jing Dong, Wei Wang, and Tieniu Tan. *CASIA image tampering detection evaluation database*. In IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing, pages 422–426, 2013.

2. **FantasticReality**: A dataset with 16,592 fake images, used for training.
   - Citation:

3. **IMD2020**: A dataset containing 414 images, tailored for detecting manipulated images.
   - Citation: 
     > Adam Novozamsky, Babak Mahdian, and Stanislav Saic. *IMD2020: A large-scale annotated dataset tailored for detecting manipulated images*. In IEEE/CVF WACV Workshops, 2020.

4. **OpenForensics**: A dataset of face manipulations generated using GAN models, containing 2,000 images.
   - Citation: 
     > Trung-Nghia Le, Huy H. Nguyen, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. *OpenForensics: Large-Scale Challenging Dataset for Multi-Face Forgery Detection and Segmentation In-the-Wild*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10117–10127, October 2021.

5. **CocoGlide**: A dataset created by the authors, containing 512 manipulated images generated using the GLIDE diffusion model.
   - Citation: 
     > Alexander Quinn Nichol et al. *GLIDE: Towards photorealistic image generation and editing with text-guided diffusion models*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 162, pages 16784–16804, Jul 2022.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
