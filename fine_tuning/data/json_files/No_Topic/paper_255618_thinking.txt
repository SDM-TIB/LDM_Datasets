To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DPVNet: Patch-level 3D Hough Voting Network for 6D Pose Estimation" by Yuanpeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of pose estimation in point clouds and mention that their method is evaluated on several datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UWA Dataset**: A 3D scanned dataset containing four complete object models and 50 3D scenes, with each object annotated with a ground truth pose.

2. **LineMOD Dataset**: This dataset contains 15 complete object models, captured from approximately 1200 different viewpoints using a RGB-D sensor, and is commonly used for pose estimation tasks.

3. **Bin-Picking Dataset**: This dataset includes two complete object models and 177 RGB-D scenes, where multiple instances of objects are placed in a bin, presenting challenges due to occlusions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UWA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. S. Mian, M. Bennamoun, and R. Owens. *Three-dimensional model-based object recognition and segmentation in cluttered scenes*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 28(10):1584–1601, 2006.

- For the **LineMOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Hinterstoisser, C. Cagniart, S. Ilic, P. Sturm, N. Navab, P. Fua, and V. Lepetit. *Gradient response maps for real-time detection of textureless objects*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 34(5):876–888, 2011.

- For the **Bin-Picking Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Doumanoglou, R. Kouskouridas, S. Malassiotis, and T.-K. Kim. *Recovering 6D object pose and predicting next-best-view in the crowd*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3583–3592, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
