To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Low-Power Music Recognition" by Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a music recognition system that operates on a mobile device, but it does not specify any datasets at this point. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of music recognition but also does not name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology sections**, particularly sections that describe the training of the neural network and the music detector. In **section 3 (Neural Network Fingerprinter)**, the authors mention that the NNFP model is trained on a dataset of noisy music segments aligned with reference songs. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

In **section 5 (Music Detector)**, the authors state that the music detector is trained on a dataset containing a subset of **AudioSet** and additional noise-added audio clips labeled with music present or not present. This is a significant finding, as it identifies a specific dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the **AudioSet** dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **AudioSet**: 
  > Gemmeke, J. F., Ellis, D. P. W., Freedman, D., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, R. C., Plakal, M., & Ritter, M. (2017). Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events. In Proc. IEEE ICASSP 2017, New Orleans, LA.

Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset of noisy music segments, I will note that it is a custom dataset used for training but lacks a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for **AudioSet** and noting the custom dataset without a citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
