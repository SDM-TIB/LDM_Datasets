To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Ensembling based Few-Shot Defect Detection Technique" by Abeer Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a "power-line defect detection dataset" and several standard datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss the methodology and experiments. In the **introduction**, the authors mention using standard datasets such as **Aircraft**, **Traffic**, **Omniglot**, **FC100**, **VGG Flower**, **Texture**, and the **Powerline Components dataset**. This is a good indication that these datasets will be detailed further in the paper.

In **section 1 (Introduction)**, the authors describe the **Powerline Components dataset** in more detail, noting that it consists of five classes (spacer, bolts, nests, insulators, and the defect class, missing bolts) and that it contains thousands of images with significant class imbalance. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used and their specific roles in the evaluation. The authors mention that they evaluated their model on the **Powerline Components dataset** and the standard datasets listed earlier. This confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the standard datasets are as follows:

- **Powerline Components Dataset**:
  > This dataset is described in the paper but does not have a formal citation since it appears to be a custom dataset created by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
