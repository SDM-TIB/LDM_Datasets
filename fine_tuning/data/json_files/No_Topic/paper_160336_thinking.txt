To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank RNN Adaptation for Context-Aware Language Modeling" by Aaron Jaech and Mari Ostendorf, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the context-aware language model and hints at the use of multiple datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sizes, types, and context variables. The authors mention six datasets, which I will summarize:

1. **AGNews**: A dataset consisting of newspaper headlines, with context variables related to newspaper sections.
2. **DBPedia**: A dataset of encyclopedia entries categorized into 14 entity categories.
3. **TripAdvisor**: A dataset of hotel reviews with context variables including hotel identifiers and sentiment scores.
4. **Yelp**: A dataset of restaurant and business reviews, with context variables related to star ratings.
5. **EuroTwitter**: A dataset of tweets labeled with languages, created from multiple sources for language identification.
6. **GeoTwitter**: A dataset of tweets with geographical coordinates, used for location-based classification.

I will also check **Table 1** in the paper, which summarizes the statistics of these datasets, including training, development, and test sizes, vocabulary sizes, and context variables. This table will provide additional details that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- AGNews, which may reference the original work by Zhang et al. (2015).
- DBPedia, which may also have a citation in the same vein.
- TripAdvisor, which might reference Tang et al. (2016).
- Yelp, which could similarly reference prior work.
- EuroTwitter and GeoTwitter, which may have citations from Jaech et al. (2016) and others.

Once I have collected all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
