To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSB: Simple but Strong Baseline for Boosting Performance of Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning" by Yue Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet-30** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of classes and any specific configurations mentioned.

1. **CIFAR-10**: The paper states that CIFAR-10 consists of 10 classes, with 6 classes used as inliers and 4 as outliers during training. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking in machine learning.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 contains 100 classes, with configurations mentioned for both 55 inlier classes and 45 outlier classes. The authors also mention using different numbers of labeled data for their experiments.

3. **ImageNet-30**: This dataset is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, containing 30 classes, with the first 20 used as inliers and the remaining 10 as outliers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. Technical report.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily accessed later.
