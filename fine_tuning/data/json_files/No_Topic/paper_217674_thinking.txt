To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expression of Fractals Through Neural Network Functions" by Nadav Dym et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets or sources of data that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used data from," or "our experiments involved."

After that, I will examine any **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors conducted experiments using specific datasets, this information is likely to be found here.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of how the results relate to the data used.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

In this specific paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and their applications, as the authors discuss fractals and their representation through neural networks. If any datasets related to IFS or fractal generation are mentioned, I will document them accordingly.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the source material. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets referenced in the paper.
