To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Fire Allocation in a NCW-type Model" by Nam H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may reference previous works or datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. This section typically outlines the datasets used for numerical experiments or simulations. In this paper, I will pay close attention to any numerical experiments described, as they often involve specific datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely to identify any datasets that were utilized in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their characteristics, such as size, type, or source.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the authors refer to datasets that are well-known or widely used in the field, I will ensure to include their standard citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Examine the results or experiments section for details on datasets used.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format, ensuring to include all necessary citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
