To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep MOS Predictor for Synthetic Speech Using Cluster-Based Modeling" by Yeunju Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments using evaluation results from the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2018**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two main datasets:

1. **Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018**: This dataset is used for both mean opinion score (MOS) and similarity evaluations. It consists of recordings from professional US English speakers and includes a total of 20,580 utterances rated by 267 people.

2. **Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2016**: This dataset is referenced for testing the generalization ability of the models trained on the VCC 2018 dataset. It contains 26,028 utterances from 20 systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2018**, the citation is:
  > J. Lorenzo-Trueba, J. Yamagishi, T. Toda, D. Saito, F. Villavicencio, T. Kinnunen, and Z. Ling. *The voice conversion challenge 2018: Promoting development of parallel and nonparallel methods*. In Proceedings of Odyssey The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop, 2018, pp. 195–202.

- For the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2016**, the citation is:
  > T. Toda, L. Chen, D. Saito, F. Villavicencio, M. Wester, Z. Wu, and J. Yamagishi. *The Voice Conversion Challenge 2016*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2016, pp. 1632–1636.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
