To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Effective Training in Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation" by Sai Koneru, Danni Liu, and Jan Niehues, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of low-resource neural machine translation and hints at the use of various data sources, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Wikipedia Mono (En)**: This dataset consists of English monolingual data sourced from Wikipedia dumps, with a total of 46 million examples for training and 5,000 for validation and testing.

2. **AI4Bharat Mono (Kn)**: This dataset contains Kannada monolingual data from the AI4Bharat-IndicNLP corpus, totaling 15 million examples for training and 5,000 for validation and testing.

3. **PM-India Dataset**: This is a parallel dataset between English and Kannada, with 29,000 training examples, 1,100 validation examples, and 2,400 testing examples.

4. **Kaikki Dictionary**: This dataset is a bilingual dictionary between English and Kannada, containing 1,146 entries, which are single word-to-word translations.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia Mono (En)**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), Accessed on [Date].

- For **AI4Bharat Mono (Kn)**, the citation is:
  > Anoop Kunchukuttan, Divyanshu Kakwani, Satish Golla, Avik Bhattacharyya, Mitesh M Khapra, Pratyush Kumar, et al. *AI4Bharat-IndicNLP Corpus: Monolingual Corpora and Word Embeddings for Indic Languages*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00085, 2020.

- For **PM-India Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barry Haddow and Faheem Kirefu. *PMIndia â€“ A Collection of Parallel Corpora of Languages of India*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.09907, 2020.

- For **Kaikki Dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Kaikki. *Kaikki Dictionary*. [Kaikki](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/), Accessed on [Date].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, type, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
