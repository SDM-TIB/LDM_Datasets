To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TxAllo: Dynamic Transaction Allocation in Sharded Blockchain Systems" by Yuanzhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on an **Ethereum dataset containing over 91 million transactions**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this case, the paper discusses the Ethereum dataset in detail in the **experiments section**. Here, it states that the dataset includes **91,857,819 transactions and 12,614,390 accounts**, which provides specific details about the dataset's size and scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the source of the Ethereum dataset as follows:

- For the Ethereum dataset, the citation is:
  > Ethereum ETL. *Ethereum ETL: Extract, Transform, Load Ethereum Blockchain Data*. Available: https://ethereum-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/google-bigquery/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes the dataset used in the research.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Locating the specific dataset details in the experiments section.
3. Finding the full citation for the dataset in the references section.

With this information, I can now create a comprehensive entry for the dataset used in the paper.
