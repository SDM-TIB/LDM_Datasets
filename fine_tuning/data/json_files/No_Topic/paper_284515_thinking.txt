To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech Emotion Recognition with Multiscale Area Attention and Data Augmentation" by Mingke Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP)** dataset, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the dataset. The introduction reiterates the use of the IEMOCAP dataset and mentions its significance in the field of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).

I will then look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the IEMOCAP dataset. They explain that it contains 12 hours of emotional speech performed by 10 actors, with utterances labeled with various emotions. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP dataset, I will ensure to gather the full citation for it from the **References section**. The citation for the IEMOCAP dataset is:

> Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335-359, 2008.

After confirming that the IEMOCAP dataset is the only dataset discussed in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the IEMOCAP dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
