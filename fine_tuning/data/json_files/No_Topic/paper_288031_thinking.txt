To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Repurposing GANs for One-shot Semantic Part Segmentation" by Nontawat Tritrong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of GANs for semantic part segmentation and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the problem being addressed and may provide insights into the datasets utilized.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using the **CelebAMask-HQ** dataset for face images and annotated segmentation masks, as well as the **PASCAL-Part** dataset for horse and car images.

I will also check the **implementation section** (Section 4) to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned that were used for training the GAN or for generating images. The authors describe using images generated by pretrained StyleGAN2s for horse and car segmentation, which indicates that these datasets were also part of their methodology.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will need to extract are:

1. **CelebAMask-HQ**:
   - Citation: Cheng-Han Lee, Ziwei Liu, Lingyun Wu, and Ping Luo. *Maskgan: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

2. **PASCAL-Part**:
   - Citation: Xianjie Chen, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Xiaobai Liu, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun, and Alan Yuille. *Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1971â€“1978, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
