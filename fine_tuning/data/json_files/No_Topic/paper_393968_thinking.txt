To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesis of Procedural Models for Deterministic Transition Systems" by Javier Segovia-Aguasa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or examples that might reference datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). If the paper discusses multiple experiments, I will ensure to note down all datasets mentioned across these experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Pancake Sorting Domain," I will search for its original source and provide a complete citation. Similarly, if there are datasets related to STRIPS or cellular automata, I will ensure to document their citations accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future use.
