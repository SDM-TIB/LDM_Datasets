To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Subsampling for Oversampled Data - Application to Quantitative MRI" by Stefano B. Blumberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a methodology called PROSUB and reference the MUlti-DIffusion (MUDI) MRI challenge, which suggests that there is a dataset associated with this challenge.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**. In this section, the authors describe the MUDI dataset in detail, stating that it consists of images from 5 subjects, with 3D brain images and 1344 channels. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's characteristics and its application in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUDI dataset. The paper mentions that the data is publicly available and provides a link, which is essential for proper citation.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **MUDI Dataset**: This dataset is used in the MUDI challenge and consists of images from 5 subjects, featuring a variety of diﬀusion and relaxometry contrasts. The total acquisition time for these oversampled datasets was approximately 1 hour, resulting in 5, 3D brain images with 1344 channels.

The full citation for the MUDI dataset is:
> MUlti-dimensional DIﬀusion (MUDI) MRI challenge 2019. Available at: https://www.developingbrain.co.uk/data/

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured manner for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that the information is ready for further processing or review.
