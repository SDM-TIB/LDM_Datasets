To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantics in Multi-objective Genetic Programming" by Edgar Galv√°n et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will specifically look for a **section dedicated to datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methods or experiments sections. In this paper, there is a table (Table 1) that summarizes the binary unbalanced classification datasets used in the experiments. This table includes key details such as the number of examples, class ratios, and brief descriptions.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Ion Dataset**: This dataset consists of radar signals from the Ionosphere, with a total of 351 examples, where 126 are positive (35.8%) and 225 are negative (64.2%).

2. **Spect Dataset**: This dataset contains tomography scan data, with a total of 267 examples, where 55 are positive (20.6%) and 212 are negative (79.4%).

3. **Yeast1 Dataset**: This dataset includes protein sequences, with a total of 1482 examples, where 163 are positive (10.9%) and 1319 are negative (89.1%).

4. **Yeast2 Dataset**: Another protein sequence dataset, with a total of 1482 examples, where 244 are positive (16.5%) and 1238 are negative (83.5%).

5. **Abal1 Dataset**: This dataset relates to the biology of abalone, with a total of 4177 examples, where 32 are positive (0.77%) and 4145 are negative (99.2%).

6. **Abal2 Dataset**: Another abalone dataset, with a total of 731 examples, where 42 are positive (5.7%) and 689 are negative (94.2%).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, in this paper, the datasets are not attributed to specific citations, as they are commonly known datasets in the field of machine learning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. The full citations for the datasets may not be available in this paper, but I will note that they are standard datasets used in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
