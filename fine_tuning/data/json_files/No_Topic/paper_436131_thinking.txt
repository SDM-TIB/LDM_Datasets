To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ParaNames 1.0: Creating an Entity Name Corpus for 400+ Languages using Wikidata" by Jonne S채lev채 and Constantine Lignos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that ParaNames is a multilingual parallel name resource consisting of 140 million names across over 400 languages, which suggests that the dataset is significant.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset construction section** (Section 3) where the authors describe how they created ParaNames. Here, they mention that they extracted entity records from Wikidata, which serves as the primary source for the dataset. They also provide details about the number of names and entities included in the dataset.

In Section 3.4, the authors provide a breakdown of the types of entities included in ParaNames, which are categorized as person (PER), location (LOC), and organization (ORG). They specify the counts for each type:
- **PER**: 10,002,138
- **LOC**: 3,880,088
- **ORG**: 2,631,350
- **Mixed**: 320,961
- **Total**: 16,834,537

This section confirms that ParaNames is a comprehensive dataset with a diverse range of entity types.

I will also check the **conclusion section** to see if the authors mention any specific applications or evaluations of the dataset, which could provide additional context for its use.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that ParaNames is released at a specific URL, which is important for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> S채lev채, J., & Lignos, C. (2024). ParaNames 1.0: Creating an Entity Name Corpus for 400+ Languages using Wikidata. In Proceedings of the LREC-COLING 2024. Available at: https://github.com/bltlab/paranames.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for ParaNames as it is crucial for proper attribution.
