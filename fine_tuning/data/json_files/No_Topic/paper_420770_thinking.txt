To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CataractBot: An LLM-Powered Expert-in-the-Loop Chatbot for Cataract Patients" by Pragnya Ramjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the study design or data collection methods. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in the deployment study, such as participant demographics or any data collected from interactions with the chatbot.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected during the study. This may include participant demographics, usage statistics, or any other relevant data that could be classified as a dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Sankara Eye Hospital Patient Data," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset and provide the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
