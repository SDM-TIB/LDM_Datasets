To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Knowledge Graphs to Generate Scene Graphs" by Alireza Zareian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimentation, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section 5) to find explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors refer to the **Visual Genome** dataset, which is a large-scale dataset consisting of images with annotated objects and relationships. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the Visual Genome dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the Visual Genome dataset is as follows:

- **Visual Genome**:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A., et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 32â€“73, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for hints about datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Check the references for full citations of the identified datasets.

This methodical approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
