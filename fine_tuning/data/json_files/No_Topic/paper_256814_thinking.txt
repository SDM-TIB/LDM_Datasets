To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense-View GEIs Set: View Space Covering for Gait Recognition based on Dense-View GAN" by Rijun Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on the **CASIA-B** and **OU-ISIR** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **CASIA-B Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the popular public gait databases created by the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It contains 124 subjects, with each subject having six sequences captured at 11 views, ranging from 0° to 180° with an 18° interval. The authors focus on the normal walking condition for their experiments.

2. **OU-ISIR Large Population Dataset**: This dataset is noted for containing 4007 subjects and includes two sequences under normal walking conditions. It has only 4 views (55°, 65°, 75°, and 85°), which allows for a statistically reliable evaluation of gait recognition performance.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CASIA-B Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu, S., Tan, D., & Tan, T. (2006). A framework for evaluating the effect of view angle, clothing and carrying condition on gait recognition. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (pp. 441–444).

- For the **OU-ISIR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iwama, H., Okumura, M., Makihara, Y., & Yagi, Y. (2012). The OU-ISIR gait database comprising the large population dataset and performance evaluation of gait recognition. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 7(5), 1511–1521.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
