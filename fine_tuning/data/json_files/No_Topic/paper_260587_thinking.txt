To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks" by Shiying Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to identify any specific datasets used in the study. I will look for sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as these typically contain the most relevant information.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for descriptions of how the datasets were generated or sourced. For instance, the authors may mention using synthetic datasets generated through numerical solvers or real-world datasets from previous studies. I will take note of any dataset names, sizes, and characteristics that are provided.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Pendulum Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from a previous study, I will ensure to cite the original source accurately.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's information.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and are complete, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the paper effectively.
