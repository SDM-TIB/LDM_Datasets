To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Neural Machine Reading Comprehension" by Boyu Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the importance of large-scale datasets in the field of Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors categorize various MRC datasets. This section is likely to contain the specific datasets I need to extract. I will read through the subsections (2.1 to 2.4) to identify the datasets mentioned, their characteristics, and any relevant citations.

In **subsection 2.1 (Cloze-Style)**, the authors mention the following datasets:
1. **CNN/Daily Mail**: This dataset consists of 93,000 articles from CNN and 220,000 articles from Daily Mail, where entities in critical sentences are replaced with placeholders.
   - Citation: Hermann et al., 2015. Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In NIPS, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

2. **Children’s Book Test (CBT)**: This dataset includes sequences of 21 consecutive sentences from children's books, where the task is to infer the missing word in the 21st sentence.
   - Citation: Hill et al., 2016. The goldilocks principle: Reading children’s books with explicit memory representations. In ICLR, 2016.

In **subsection 2.2 (Multi-Choice)**, I find:
3. **MCTest**: A dataset with 660 fictional stories, each accompanied by 4 questions and 4 candidate answers.
   - Citation: Richardson et al., 2013. MCTEST: A challenge dataset for the open-domain machine comprehension of text. In EMNLP, pages 193–203, 2013.

4. **RACE**: This dataset contains over 20,000 articles and 100,000 questions from English exams for middle and high school students.
   - Citation: Lai et al., 2017. RACE: large-scale reading comprehension dataset from examinations. In EMNLP, pages 785–794, 2017.

In **subsection 2.3 (Span-Prediction)**, I identify:
5. **SQuAD**: A dataset with over 100,000 questions identified in 536 Wikipedia articles, where each question corresponds to a specific passage.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar et al., 2016. SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In EMNLP, pages 2383–2392, 2016.

6. **SQuAD2.0**: An updated version of SQuAD that includes unanswerable questions.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar et al., 2018. Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD. In ACL, pages 784–789, 2018.

7. **TriviaQA**: This dataset contains over 650,000 question-answer-evidence triples.
   - Citation: Joshi et al., 2017. TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension. In ACL, pages 1601–1611, 2017.

In **subsection 2.4 (Free-Form)**, I find:
8. **NarrativeQA**: A dataset aimed at increasing the difficulty of questions, containing 1,567 complete stories from books and screenplays.
   - Citation: Kociský et al., 2018. The NarrativeQA reading comprehension challenge. TACL, 6:317–328, 2018.

9. **DuReader**: A Chinese reading comprehension dataset with over 1 million documents and more than 200,000 different types of questions.
   - Citation: He et al., 2018. DuReader: A Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset from real-world applications. In ACL, pages 37–46, 2018.

10. **MS MARCO**: A large-scale machine reading comprehension dataset comprising over 8 million passages and 1 million anonymized questions.
    - Citation: Nguyen et al., 2016. MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset. In NIPS, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
