To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Playing hard exploration games by watching YouTube" by Yusuf Aytar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors use YouTube videos to guide exploration in reinforcement learning, which suggests that these videos are a primary dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **supplementary material** and **section 8 (Supplementary Material)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they selected four gameplay videos from YouTube for each Atari game they considered. The specific games mentioned are **MONTEZUMA’S REVENGE**, **PITFALL!**, and **PRIVATE EYE**.

In the supplementary material, the authors provide a table that lists the video links, high scores, clip windows, and start times for each game. This information is crucial for documenting the datasets accurately.

The datasets extracted from the paper are as follows:

1. **MONTEZUMA’S REVENGE**:
   - Video links: 
     - [Video 1](https://youtu.be/sYbBgkP9aMo)
     - [Video 2](https://youtu.be/6zXXZvVvTFs)
     - [Video 3](https://youtu.be/SuZVyOlgVek)
     - [Validation Video](https://youtu.be/2AYaxTiWKoY)

2. **PITFALL!**:
   - Video links:

3. **PRIVATE EYE**:
   - Video links: 
     - [Video 1](https://youtu.be/jt0YhI_CYUs)
     - [Video 2](https://youtu.be/CkDllyETiBA)
     - [Video 3](https://youtu.be/aAJzamWAFOE)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details and provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
