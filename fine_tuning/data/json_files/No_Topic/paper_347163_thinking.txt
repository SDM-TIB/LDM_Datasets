To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inductive Conformal Prediction: A Straightforward Introduction with Examples in Python" by Martim Sousa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and examples sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction also does not specify datasets but sets the stage for the examples that follow.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Examples on regression)**, where the author mentions using the **Boston housing prices dataset**. This dataset is described as publicly available on sklearn and contains 506 samples with 13 numerical features for predicting house prices. I will note down the details of this dataset.

In **section 3 (Examples on classification)**, the author discusses using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes. This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks. I will also document this dataset's details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Boston housing prices dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Prettenhofer, P., Weiss, V., Dubourg, J., Vanderplas, J., Passos, A., Cournapeau, D., Brucher, M., Perrot, M., & Duchesnay, E. (2011). Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 12, 2825â€“2830.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is widely recognized in the literature. A common citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, University of Toronto.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the paper along with their proper citations.
