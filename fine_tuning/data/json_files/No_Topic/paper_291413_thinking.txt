To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interspecific allometric scaling of multicellular organisms as an evolutionary process of food chain creation, influenced by mechanical constraints" by Yuri K. Shestopaloff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on metabolic rates and allometric scaling, which suggests that there may be datasets related to metabolic rates across different taxa.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The author discusses various studies and mentions the scaling of metabolic rates in mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds, which indicates that there may be datasets related to these groups.

In the **methods section**, I will check for any descriptions of how data were collected or analyzed. This section may provide insights into the datasets used, including any specific measurements or sources referenced.

The **results section** is crucial, as it often contains tables or figures summarizing the datasets. I will look for any tables that list species, their metabolic rates, body masses, and other relevant measurements. For example, the paper includes tables with data for mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds, which are essential for understanding the allometric scaling discussed.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the original data sources.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Mammalian Metabolic Rates Dataset**: This dataset includes various mammals, their body masses, and corresponding metabolic rates. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Weibel, E. R., & Hoppeler, H. (2005). Exercise-induced maximal metabolic rate scales with muscle aerobic capacity. *Journal of Experimental Biology*, 208, 1635-1644.

2. **Reptilian Metabolic Rates Dataset**: This dataset includes measurements for reptiles, detailing their body masses and metabolic rates. The citation is:
   > McNab, B. K. (2009). Ecological factors affect the level and scaling of avian BMR. *Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A*, 152, 22-45.

3. **Fish Metabolic Rates Dataset**: This dataset includes various fish species, their body masses, and metabolic rates. The citation is:
   > Brett, J. R. (1965). The relation of size to rate of oxygen consumption and sustained swimming speed of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). *Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada*, 22, 1491-1501.

4. **Bird Metabolic Rates Dataset**: This dataset includes birds, their body masses, and metabolic rates. The citation is:
   > White, C. R., & Seymour, R. S. (2005). Review. Allometric scaling of mammalian metabolism. *Journal of Experimental Biology*, 208, 1611-1619.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further analysis or presentation.
