To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MGP: Un algorithme de planification temps réel prenant en compte l’évolution dynamique du but" by Damien Pellier et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed algorithm and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the context of their research and any datasets they might have used for comparison or evaluation. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

Then, I will examine the **experimentation and evaluation section** (section 3) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the authors refer to datasets from previous works or competitions, I will ensure to note those references as well. For example, if they mention using datasets from the International Planning Competition (IPC), I will look for the specific problems or datasets they utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors used a dataset from a previous study, I will find the corresponding citation in the references and ensure it is complete, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets used in the experiments and note their characteristics.
3. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information into a clear and structured format for further use.
