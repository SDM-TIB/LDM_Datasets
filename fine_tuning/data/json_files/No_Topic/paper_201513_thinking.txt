To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks based Intra Prediction for HEVC" by Wenxue Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for intra prediction in HEVC, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Method)**, particularly the subsection **3.2 (Datasets for Training)**. Here, the authors discuss the datasets used for training their CNN model. They mention that the training samples are extracted from HEVC intra coding, specifically using 16x16 context blocks that include an 8x8 prediction unit (PU) block and its three nearest 8x8 reconstruction blocks. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a publicly available dataset, I will check the **experimental results section (Section 4)** to see if any specific sequences or datasets are referenced. The authors mention using "10 sequences of four different quantization parameters (QPs): 22, 27, 32, and 37," but again, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

To ensure I have not missed any references, I will also review the **References section** for any cited datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing HEVC and related methodologies, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any datasets, I will note that the authors utilized sequences from HEVC standard test video sequences but did not specify which sequences were used. Therefore, I will document this as a dataset entry without a formal citation.

In summary, I will create an entry for the dataset based on the information gathered:

1. **HEVC Standard Test Video Sequences**: The authors used sequences from the HEVC standard test video sequences for training their model, but no specific dataset name or citation is provided.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
