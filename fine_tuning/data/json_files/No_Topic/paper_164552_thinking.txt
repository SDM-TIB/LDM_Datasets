To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Unravelling Robustness of Deep Learning based Face Recognition Against Adversarial Attacks" by Gaurav Goswami et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using "two publicly available databases (MEDS and PaSC)," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing the experiments and datasets**. In the paper, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **Point and Shoot Challenge (PaSC) Database**: This dataset contains 4,688 images of 293 subjects, specifically used for still-to-still and video-to-video matching protocols.

2. **Multiple Encounters Dataset (MEDS-II)**: This dataset includes 858 frontal face images from 518 subjects, used for evaluating face verification performance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PaSC Database**, the citation is:
  > Beveridge, J.; Phillips, P.; Bolme, D.; Draper, B.; Given, G.; Lui, Y. M.; Teli, M.; Zhang, H.; Scruggs, W.; Bowyer, K.; Flynn, P.; and Cheng, S. (2013). *The challenge of face recognition from digital point-and-shoot cameras*. In IEEE Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems, 1–8.

- For the **MEDS-II Database**, the citation is:
  > Founds, A. P.; Orlans, N.; Genevieve, W.; and Watson, C. I. (2011). *NIST Special Database 32-Multiple Encounter Dataset II (MEDS-II)*. NIST Interagency/Internal Report (NISTIR)-7807.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Point and Shoot Challenge (PaSC) Database**
   - Citation: Beveridge et al. (2013)
   
2. **Multiple Encounters Dataset (MEDS-II)**
   - Citation: Founds et al. (2011)

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately identified and cited the datasets used in the research paper.
