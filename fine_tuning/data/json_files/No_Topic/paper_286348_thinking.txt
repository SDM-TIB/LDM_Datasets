To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wider Vision: Enriching Convolutional Neural Networks via Alignment to External Knowledge Bases" by Xuehao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison, so I will pay close attention to that section.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections dedicated to datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their approach and evaluation methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or testing their models. I will focus on sections that describe the experimental setup, as they often detail the datasets employed.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training their CNN model (VGG-16) and the **COCO dataset** for testing their approach. I will note these datasets and their relevance to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

2. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the ImageNet and COCO datasets as they are critical for proper documentation and future reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for review or further processing.
