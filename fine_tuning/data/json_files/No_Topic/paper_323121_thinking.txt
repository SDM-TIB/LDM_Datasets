To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware-friendly Deep Learning by Network Quantization and Binarization" by Haotong Qin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing experiments or methodologies** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract primarily discusses quantization and its implications for deep learning but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction**.

In the **introduction**, the focus is on the challenges of deep neural networks and their reliance on high-performance hardware, but again, no datasets are explicitly mentioned. Next, I will examine the **Quantization and Binarization** section, which discusses techniques rather than datasets.

Moving on to **section 3 (Our Studies)**, I will look for any mention of datasets used in the studies or experiments. The section discusses various approaches to quantization and binarization, including **Quantization-Aware Training** and **Binarized Convolutional Neural Networks**, but it does not specify any datasets.

In **section 3.2 (Data-Free Quantization)**, the authors mention the use of synthetic data for calibrating quantized models, but this does not refer to a specific dataset. 

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily cite papers related to quantization techniques and do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be extracted for citation. The focus of the paper is more on methodologies and techniques rather than specific datasets used for experiments.

Since no datasets are identified, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to compile. If any datasets had been mentioned, I would have ensured to retrieve full citations for each and format them accordingly.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
