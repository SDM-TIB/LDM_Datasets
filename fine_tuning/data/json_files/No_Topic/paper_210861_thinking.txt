To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Anchored Speech Recognition" by Yiming Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of speech recognition in the presence of background noise and mentions the use of live data from Amazon Echo, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In section 4.1, they mention conducting experiments on a training corpus consisting of **1200 hours of live data in English from Amazon Echo**. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets or synthetic data mentioned in the paper. In section 3, the authors describe two methods for generating synthetic data to augment their training set. They detail how they create synthetic utterances by inserting segments from other utterances, which is important for understanding the data used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Amazon Echo Live Data**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but it is essential to note that it consists of 1200 hours of live data collected from Amazon Echo devices. Since this is proprietary data, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

2. **Synthetic Data**: The paper describes two synthetic data generation methods but does not provide a formal citation for these methods as they are part of the authors' experimental design. However, I will note that the synthetic data is generated from the original device-directed speech data.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations as required. The Amazon Echo live data will be noted as a significant dataset used in the experiments, while the synthetic data will be described as a method of augmentation rather than a standalone dataset with a citation.
