To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Model Agnostic Approach for Implicit Neural Representation Based Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution" by Young Jae Oh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their approach employs the same datasets as their backbone models, specifically LIIF and LTE. This indicates that I should look for these datasets in the context of their original papers.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that their approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and is part of the NTIRE 2017 Challenge on single image super-resolution.
2. **Set5**: A benchmark dataset commonly used for evaluating super-resolution methods.
3. **Set14**: Another widely used dataset for super-resolution evaluation.
4. **B100**: A dataset that contains 100 images for testing super-resolution algorithms.
5. **Urban100**: A dataset consisting of urban scenes, also used for benchmarking super-resolution methods.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Set5**, the citation is:

- For **Set14**, the citation is:
  > Abhishek Singh, Jia-Bin Huang, and Narendra Ahuja. *Single image super-resolution from transformed self-exemplars*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **B100**, the citation is:
  > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001.

- For **Urban100**, the citation is:
  > Yulun Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Yu Kong, Bineng Zhong, and Yun Fu. *Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
