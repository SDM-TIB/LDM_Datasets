To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planted Bipartite Graph Detection" by Asaf Rotenberg, Wasim Huleihel, and Ofer Shayevitz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses related work and may mention datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will have a specific section where they describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically includes the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for the detection of planted bipartite graphs. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "Erdős-Rényi random graph," I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset in detail. If they mention any specific datasets created or used in their experiments, I will ensure to capture those citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Note any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information and citations for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
