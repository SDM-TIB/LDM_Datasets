To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-based approach to detect cyber attacks on market-based congestion management methods" by Omniyah Gul M Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **IEEE 33 bus system** as a case study, which suggests that this might be a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **case study system details** section. Here, the authors describe the **IEEE 33 bus system** in detail, indicating that it is a well-defined dataset used for their experiments. I will note down the relevant details about this dataset, including its structure and purpose in the context of the research.

In the **data set, feature extraction, and preprocessing** section, the authors mention that they utilized **hourly customer real power load, electricity price, and weather data for Michigan, USA**. This indicates that there are additional datasets involved, specifically related to weather and electricity prices. I will gather details about these datasets, including the time frame and the nature of the data collected.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IEEE 33 bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems, and I will look for its authoritative citation. The authors also reference various studies and datasets related to electricity prices and weather data, which I will need to cite appropriately.

For the **IEEE 33 bus system**, the citation is:
> M. E. Baran and F. F. Wu. "Network reconfiguration in distribution systems for loss reduction and load balancing." *IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery*, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 1401â€“1407, April 1989.

For the **weather data** and **electricity price data**, I will need to find the original sources or datasets referenced in the paper. The authors mention using data from the PJM market, which I will cite as:
> PJM Interconnection. "Data miner." Available: https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/etools/data-miner-2.aspx [Accessed: Date].

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the IEEE 33 bus system and the weather and electricity price datasets used in their analysis.
