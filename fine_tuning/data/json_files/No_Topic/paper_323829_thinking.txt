To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Parametric Pose Prior" by Andrey Davydov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain detailed dataset information. However, it may hint at the datasets used, so I will take note of any names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the paper, I notice that the authors mention using the **AMASS dataset** in section 3.2, which is crucial for their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **AMASS dataset**, the citation is:
> Naureen Mahmood, Nima Ghorbani, Nikolaus F. Troje, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J. Black. *AMASS: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes*. In International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5442â€“5451, Oct. 2019.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
