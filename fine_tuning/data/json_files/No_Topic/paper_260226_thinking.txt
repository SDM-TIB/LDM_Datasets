To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Upsampling Artifacts in Neural Audio Synthesis" by Jordi Pons et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and datasets**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various neural audio synthesizers and their reliance on upsampling layers, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** to find more concrete references.

In **section 6 (The Role of Training)**, the authors mention using the **MUSDB** benchmark for their experiments. They describe it as a dataset composed of stereo songs at 44.1 kHz, which is used for music source separation. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Zafar Rafii, Antoine Liutkus, Stylianos Ioannis Mimilakis, and Rachel Bittner. *MUSDB18 corpus for music separation*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MUSDB**: A dataset used for music source separation, consisting of stereo songs at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in research contexts.
