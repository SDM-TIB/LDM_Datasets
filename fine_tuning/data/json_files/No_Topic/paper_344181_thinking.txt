To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Median Pixel Difference Convolutional Network for Robust Face Recognition" by Jiehua Zhang, Zhuo Su, and Li Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method is tested on four face datasets: **LFW**, **CA-LFW**, **CP-LFW**, and **YouTube Faces**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **CASIA-WebFace**: This dataset is collected from IMDb and contains 10,575 subjects and 494,141 images. The authors describe the collection and annotation process, which is semi-automated.

2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset contains over 13,000 face images from the web, with each face labeled with a person's name. It is noted for its clean labeling despite some mislabeled pairs.

3. **CA-LFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: A renovation of the LFW dataset focusing on cross-age face challenges, containing 3,000 positive face pairs with age gaps.

4. **CP-LFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: Another renovation of the LFW dataset, this one focusing on cross-pose challenges, also containing 3,000 positive face pairs.

5. **YouTube Faces (YTF)**: This dataset consists of 3,425 videos from 1,595 different people, collected from YouTube, aimed at studying face recognition in videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
