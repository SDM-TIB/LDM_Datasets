To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Certification of Machine-Learning Systems for Low Criticality Airborne Applications" by Konstantin Dmitriev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in prior studies or datasets that the authors plan to utilize.

I will then examine the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and may explicitly list the datasets used for training or testing the machine learning models. If the authors describe any datasets, I will take note of their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references, which might include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all information is clear and well-organized.
