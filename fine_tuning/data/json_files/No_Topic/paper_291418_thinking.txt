To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Immune checkpoint therapy modeling of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades reveals subtle difference in their response dynamics and potential synergy in combination" by Kamran Kaveh and Feng Fu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets used in their modeling or analysis. This section often contains background information that may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

I will then examine the **methods section** closely, as it typically details the data sources, including any datasets used for simulations or analyses. If the authors describe their modeling framework, they may also mention the datasets that informed their parameters or initial conditions.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures or tables that summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. This may provide insights into the datasets used and their relevance to the study's findings.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to previously published datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation details for each dataset.

Throughout this process, I will take notes on the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the corresponding citations. If the paper mentions any specific datasets used for simulations or analyses, I will ensure to document them accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their full citations, to ensure proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.
