To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FI-CBL: A Probabilistic Method for Concept-Based Learning with Expert Rules" by Lev V. Utkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset constructed from the MNIST dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will check the **numerical experiments section** where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention the construction of a synthetic dataset from the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. They also reference the modified CelebA dataset, which is used for comparison.

In the **illustrative example** section, the authors provide details about the synthetic dataset derived from MNIST, explaining how it is structured and the concepts defined within it. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the necessary information for each dataset:

1. **Synthetic MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from the original MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. The synthetic dataset consists of instances made up of four different digits arranged in a 56x56 pixel format. The authors describe the concepts associated with this dataset, including the target variable and binary concepts.

2. **Modified CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is a modified version of the CelebA dataset, which originally contains 200,000 images annotated with 40 face attributes. The authors mention that their modification restricts the dataset to 20 classes and uses a subset of images for their experiments.

Next, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
