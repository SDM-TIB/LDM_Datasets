To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Complex Valued Convolutional Neural Networks" by Nitzan Guberman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions the challenges of overfitting, but does not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the empirical study section, as this is where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 5 (Empirical Study - Cell Identification)**, the author describes the experimental setup for testing the complex CNN model. Here, the author mentions using **simulated fluorescence microscopy images** as the dataset for the task of cell identification. The dataset consists of color images of multiple cells, which were transformed into grayscale and processed to create gradient images.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned. In the empirical study, the author references the source of the simulated fluorescence microscopy images as follows:

- For the simulated fluorescence microscopy images, the citation is:
  > Antti Lehmussola, Pekka Ruusuvuori, Jyrki Selinummi, Heikki Huttunen, and Olli Yli-Harja. *Computational framework for simulating fluorescence microscope images with cell populations*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 26(7):1010–1016, 2007.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Simulated Fluorescence Microscopy Images
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of color images of multiple cells, transformed to grayscale, and processed to create gradient images for the task of cell identification.
   - **Full Citation**: Antti Lehmussola, Pekka Ruusuvuori, Jyrki Selinummi, Heikki Huttunen, and Olli Yli-Harja. *Computational framework for simulating fluorescence microscope images with cell populations*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 26(7):1010–1016, 2007.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
