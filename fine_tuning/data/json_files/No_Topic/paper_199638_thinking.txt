To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variance Reduction for Reinforcement Learning in Input-Driven Environments" by Hongzi Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss various environments and tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the environments, as they often indicate the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments they tested their methods on. They mention environments derived from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic locomotion. I will note down any specific datasets or benchmarks referenced in this context.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MuJoCo physics simulator**, I will look for the original citation for MuJoCo, which is:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

Similarly, if they reference specific datasets related to queuing systems or network control, I will find their respective citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing complete citations for each.
