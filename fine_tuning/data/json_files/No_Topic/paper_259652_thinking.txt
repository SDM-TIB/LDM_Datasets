To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Pixel-wise Structured Sparse Network for Efficient CNNs" by Chen Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on **super-resolution and image classification tasks**, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for the super-resolution task and the **ImageNet dataset** for the image classification task. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their size, purpose, and any specific splits or versions used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is:
> Radu Timofte, Eirikur Agustsson, Luc Van Gool, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Lei Zhang. *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1110–1120, 2017.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: Used for super-resolution tasks, consisting of high-quality images for training and evaluation.
2. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or use.
