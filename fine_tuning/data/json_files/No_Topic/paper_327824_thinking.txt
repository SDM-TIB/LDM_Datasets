To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Project smells" â€” Experiences in Analysing the Software Quality of ML Projects with mllint by Bart van Oort et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**. This section typically outlines the research design and may detail any datasets that were collected or analyzed as part of the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Following that, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. These sections often provide insights into the findings of the research and may reference datasets used for analysis or comparison. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset characteristics or results derived from them.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, such as a "Datasets" or "Data Collection" section, I will focus on this part closely, as it will likely contain the most detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "mllint reports" or any specific datasets used in the analysis, I will ensure to find the original source or publication that describes these datasets in detail.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further exploration of the datasets for anyone interested in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
