To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Slugbot: An Application of a Novel and Scalable Open Domain Socialbot Framework" by Kevin K. Bowden et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various data sources, which suggests that datasets may be included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **System Design and Architecture section** and specifically look for any subsections that discuss datasets or data management. In the **Data Management subsection**, the authors describe their use of a relational database (RDS) to manage large datasets, but I need to look for specific datasets that are utilized in their experiments or system.

In the **Dialogue Modules section**, the authors mention several types of data sources used for different functionalities, such as:

1. **Opinion Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from online reviews of movies, video games, and books. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

2. **Crowdsourced Data Collection**: The authors mention gathering 17,169 topic-annotated turns through Mechanical Turk for their retrieval module. Again, no specific citation is provided.

3. **Personal Narratives Dataset**: The authors state that they built a small dataset of around 40 narratives from a large corpus of personal blogs. The paper does not provide a citation for this dataset either.

4. **Survey Data**: The survey data is extracted from popular quizzing sites, but no specific citation is given.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets have associated citations. However, it appears that the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets mentioned, which is a limitation.

Since the paper lacks specific citations for the datasets, I will note this in my documentation. I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Opinion Dataset**: Extracted from online reviews of movies, video games, and books. (No citation provided)

2. **Crowdsourced Data Collection**: 17,169 topic-annotated turns collected via Mechanical Turk. (No citation provided)

3. **Personal Narratives Dataset**: Approximately 40 narratives sourced from personal blogs. (No citation provided)

4. **Survey Data**: Collected from popular quizzing sites. (No citation provided)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, noting the absence of citations for each dataset. This will ensure that anyone reviewing the datasets understands the context and limitations regarding their sourcing.
