To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Folded Optimization for End-to-End Model-Based Learning" by James Kotary, My H. Dinh, and Ferdinando Fioretto, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In the abstract, the authors discuss experiments over various structured prediction and decision-focused learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that detail the experimental setup, as they typically contain information about the datasets used. I will focus on sections that describe the methodology and results, as they often include explicit mentions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**. Here are the datasets identified:

1. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the multilabel classification task. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **Synthetic Data for Nonconvex Bilinear Programming**: The authors generated synthetic data for their nonconvex bilinear programming experiments. This data is created by feeding inputs into a randomly initialized neural network and applying a nonlinear function to increase the mapping's complexity.

3. **Noisy Signals Dataset**: For the enhanced denoising task, the authors generated 10,000 random 1D signals of length 100, which were treated as targets. Noisy input data was created by adding random perturbations to these signals.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-100 dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is:

- For **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

The synthetic data and noisy signals are generated specifically for the experiments in this paper, so they do not have external citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or integration into a structured format.
