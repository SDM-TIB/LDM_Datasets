To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Time-domain Approach to the Design of Coupled-Resonator Microstrip Filters" by Andr√©s Altieri, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a technique for extracting coupling coefficients from time-domain simulations, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the methodology and does not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any references to datasets used for validation or comparison. In this paper, the author describes a procedure for extracting coupling coefficients and mentions comparisons with previously published results, but again, there are no specific datasets named.

I will then check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of validation or comparison with other works. The author discusses results obtained from simulations and measurements, but does not provide specific datasets or their sources.

Finally, I will look at the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. The references include various papers that may contain datasets relevant to the study, but the paper itself does not provide direct access to any datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper. The author discusses methodologies and comparisons but does not provide dataset names or citations.

2. **References to other works** may imply the existence of datasets, but these are not detailed in the paper itself.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper presents a novel approach and discusses comparisons with existing literature, it does not provide specific datasets for extraction or citation. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries as there are none explicitly mentioned in the text.
