To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastCorrect 2: Fast Error Correction on Multiple Candidates for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Yichong Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on an **in-house dataset** and **AISHELL-1**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **AISHELL-1 Dataset**: This is a public Mandarin speech corpus with 178 hours of training data, 10 hours of validation data, and 5 hours of test data. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **In-house Dataset**: This dataset consists of 75K hours of Mandarin speech, with both validation and test sets being 200 hours each. However, the authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is proprietary.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation for the **AISHELL-1 Dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **AISHELL-1 Dataset**:
  > Hui Bu, Jiayu Du, Xingyu Na, Bengu Wu, and Hao Zheng. *AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA), 2017.

Since the in-house dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset used by the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AISHELL-1 dataset and note the in-house dataset appropriately.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
