To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composing MPC with LQR and Neural Network for Amortized Efficiency and Stable Control" by Fangyu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of specific datasets in the context of the numerical experiments. The authors may describe the models they used, such as the pendulum, triple pendulum, bicopter, and quadcopter, and I will check if they reference any datasets associated with these models.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training their neural network or for evaluating their model predictive control (MPC) approach, I will note down the dataset name and its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the context and significance of each dataset in relation to the research conducted in the paper.
