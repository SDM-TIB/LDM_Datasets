To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Types of Convolution in Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition" by Che-Wei Huang and Shrikanth S Narayanan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the **eNTERFACE’05 corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Databases Description)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **eNTERFACE’05 Emotion Database**: This is a publicly available multi-modal corpus of elicited emotional utterances. It includes 1,257 utterances from 42 subjects, designed to elicit six archetypal emotions. The average length of the utterances is around 2.78 seconds.

2. **MUSAN Corpus**: This corpus is used for data augmentation, consisting of noise samples that are mixed with the clean emotional utterances to create a noisy dataset. The noise portion contains 929 samples of assorted noise types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **eNTERFACE’05 Emotion Database**, the citation is:
  > O. Martin, I. Kotsia, B. M. Macq, and I. Pitas. *The eNTERFACE’05 audio-visual emotion database*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops, 2006.

- For the **MUSAN Corpus**, the citation is:
  > D. Snyder, G. Chen, and D. Povey. *MUSAN: A Music, Speech, and Noise Corpus*. 2015, arXiv:1510.08484v1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
