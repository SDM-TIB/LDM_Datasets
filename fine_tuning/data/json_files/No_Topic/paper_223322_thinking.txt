To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JUMT at WMT2019 News Translation Task: A Hybrid approach to Machine Translation for Lithuanian to English" by Sainik Kumar Mahata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a parallel corpus consisting of sentence pairs for training their translation model, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors emphasize the importance of having a good quality and sufficient amount of parallel corpus for machine translation. They reference the parallel corpus provided by the WMT2019 organizers, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where they describe the training process. They mention using **7,62,022 sentence pairs** for training the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) model and **2,00,000 pairs** for testing the SMT system and training the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. This provides specific details about the dataset used.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the same parallel corpus for their experiments, reinforcing the significance of this dataset.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **references section**. The authors mention that the required parallel corpora were provided by the WMT2019 organizers, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can reference the WMT2019 conference proceedings as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Ond≈ôej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, and Christof Monz. *Findings of the 2018 conference on machine translation (WMT18)*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **WMT2019 Lithuanian-English Parallel Corpus**: This dataset consists of **9,62,022 sentence pairs** used for training and testing the translation models.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
