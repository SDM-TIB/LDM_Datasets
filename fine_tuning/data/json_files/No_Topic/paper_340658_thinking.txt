To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Subset Selection by Greedy and Evolutionary Pareto Optimization" by Chao Bian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they utilized for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ego-Facebook Dataset**: This dataset consists of a social network of friend links from Facebook. The authors describe how they sampled multiple networks with different edge probabilities to create various objective functions.

2. **as-733 Dataset**: This dataset includes 733 communication networks spanning 785 days. The authors explain how the nodes and edges may change over time, reflecting different causes for uncertainty in the data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ego-Facebook Dataset**, the citation is:
> Chen, W., Wang, Y., & Yang, S. (2009). Efficient influence maximization in social networks. In KDD (pp. 199-208). Paris, France.

For the **as-733 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Goyal, A., Lu, W., & Lakshmanan, L. (2011). Simpath: An efficient algorithm for influence maximization under the linear threshold model. In ICDM (pp. 211-220). Vancouver, Canada.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as described in the paper.
