To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Green Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: A Practical Approach Using Beam-Matching Error Metrics" by Luping Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **system model** sections, as they often contain references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **numerical results** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically detail the parameters and datasets used for simulations. In this paper, the authors discuss simulation parameters in **Table I**, which outlines various parameters but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Since the paper does not appear to reference any specific datasets directly, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may have datasets associated with them. I will look for papers that might have published datasets relevant to the ISAC systems or beamforming designs.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the relevant citations for any datasets that are mentioned or implied in the context of the research. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper does not provide explicit datasets but may reference methodologies or frameworks that could be applied to existing datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I write down the full citations for any datasets or related works that I find, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Check the numerical results and experiments sections for any datasets used.
3. Review the references for any cited works that may have associated datasets.
4. Compile full citations for any identified datasets or relevant works.
5. Note if no explicit datasets are mentioned in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets or relevant information from the paper.
