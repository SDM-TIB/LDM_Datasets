To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dealing with Nuisance Parameters using Machine Learning in High Energy Physics: a Review" by T. Dorigo and P. de Castro Manzano, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodologies, experiments, or applications of machine learning in high-energy physics. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their use in the research.

I will also pay close attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets in the context of their experiments or methodologies, I will note those down.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others interested in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "ATLAS dataset" or "CMS dataset," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets referenced in the paper, making it easier for others to access and utilize them in their own research.
