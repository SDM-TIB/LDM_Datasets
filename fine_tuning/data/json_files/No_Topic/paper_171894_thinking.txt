To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Colorimetric Calibration of a Digital Camera" by Renata Rychtarikova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of camera calibration but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and methods)**, particularly the subsection **2.1 (Image capture)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention that the testing image comes from an experiment on fish behavior using a **5iD viewer**. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation here.

In **section 3 (Results and discussion)**, the authors discuss the results of their image correction method but again do not mention any specific datasets. They refer to images captured during their experiments but do not provide a formal dataset that can be cited.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various studies and methods related to image processing and calibration, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset that I can extract.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors describe their methodology and the images they worked with, they do not provide a formal dataset that can be cited. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **5iD Viewer Experiment**: While the paper describes the use of images from an experiment on fish behavior, it does not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. My final output will reflect that no datasets were extracted from this research paper.
