To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Sample Complexity Upper and Lower Bounds for Exact Ranking from Noisy Comparisons" by Wenbo Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) or any section that discusses the methodology in detail. This section often contains specific references to datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if the authors reference any datasets from previous studies that they might have used or compared against. This can provide additional context about the datasets relevant to their research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets** (if present) where the authors might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For each dataset, I will document:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through accurate citations.
