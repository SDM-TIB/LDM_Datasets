To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Reference Frame Synthesis and Post Filter Enhancement for Versatile Video Coding" by Weijie Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may mention datasets used for training or evaluation, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets**. In many research papers, there is a section that outlines the datasets used for experiments. If such a section exists, I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention using the **Vimeo-90k triplet dataset** for training. This dataset consists of 73,171 3-frame sequences with a fixed resolution of 448 × 256. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, and I will ensure to document it properly.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Vimeo-90k dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the Vimeo-90k dataset is:
> T. Xue, B. Chen, J. Wu, D. Wei, and W. T. Freeman. "Video enhancement with task-oriented flow." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 127, no. 8, pp. 1106–1125, 2019.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any dedicated dataset sections for detailed descriptions.
3. Document the **Vimeo-90k triplet dataset** as it is the primary dataset mentioned.
4. Retrieve and record the full citation from the References section.
5. Compile the information for clarity and completeness.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
