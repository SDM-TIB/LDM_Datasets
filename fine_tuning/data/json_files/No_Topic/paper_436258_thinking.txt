To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Substitutability, equilibrium transport, and matching models" by Alfred Galichon and Antoine Jacquet, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss models and applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the study's focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that detail **experiments, applications, or case studies**. These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets used for analysis or validation of the models discussed. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for empirical validation, I will record its name, the number of observations, and any relevant characteristics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Housing Market Dataset" used for modeling, I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited in the references, I will note the authors and year of the original dataset publication if mentioned in the text.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly, ready for any required output format or further processing. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets from the research paper.
