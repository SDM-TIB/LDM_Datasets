To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Market for Trading Forecasts: A Wagering Mechanism" by Aitazaz Ali Raja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the concept of a market for trading forecasts but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or references to specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or experimentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors refer to a specific dataset in the **case study section**. They mention using the **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFcom2014)** dataset, which is relevant for their wind energy forecasting application. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GEFcom2014 dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the source of the dataset.

The citation for the GEFcom2014 dataset is:
> Hong, T., Pinson, P., Fan, S., Zareipour, H., Troccoli, A., & Hyndman, R. J. (2016). *Probabilistic energy forecasting: Global energy forecasting competition 2014 and beyond*. International Journal of Forecasting, 32, 896â€“913.

Now, I will compile the information about the identified dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset from the paper:
1. **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFcom2014)**: A dataset used for probabilistic energy forecasting, which includes various forecasting tasks related to energy generation.

With this information, I will be ready to present the dataset details in the required format for further processing or review.
