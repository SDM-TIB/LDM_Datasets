To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing local minima in fitness landscapes of parameter estimation by using piecewise evaluation and state estimation" by Christoph Zimmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of examples from Systems Biology, which suggests that datasets related to these examples may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the application of their method to various models. They specifically state that they will demonstrate their approach using three different example models: the **FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator**, the **Lotka-Volterra model**, and the **Calcium oscillation model**. This indicates that datasets related to these models are likely to be detailed in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors provide specific details about each model, including the parameters and the nature of the data collected. For instance, they mention that measurements for the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator are recorded at discrete time points with normally distributed noise. Similarly, the Lotka-Volterra model and Calcium oscillation model are described with their respective measurement conditions.

Now, I will extract the datasets associated with each model:

1. **FitzHugh-Nagumo Oscillator Dataset**: The measurements are recorded at time points \( t_k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 20 \) with normally distributed additive noise with variance 0.1.

2. **Lotka-Volterra Dataset**: Measurements for the prey population \( X \) and predator population \( Y \) are recorded at time points \( t_k = 0, 0.5, 1, \ldots, 24 \) with additive normally distributed measurement error with variance 1.

3. **Calcium Oscillation Model Dataset**: Measurements are recorded at time points \( t_i = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, \ldots, 50 \) with specific parameters provided for the model.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets or the original papers that describe these models. The citations for the models are as follows:

- For the **FitzHugh-Nagumo model**, the citation is:
  > R. FitzHugh. *Impulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membrane*. Biophysical Journal, 1:445 – 466, 1961.

- For the **Lotka-Volterra model**, the citation is:
  > J. Nagumo, S. Arimoto, and S. Yoshizawa. *An active pulse transmission line simulating nerve axon*. Proceedings of the IRE, pages 2061 – 2070, 1962.

- For the **Calcium oscillation model**, the citation is:
  > U. Kummer, B. Krajnc, J. Pahle, A.K. Green C.J. Dixon, and M. Marhl. *Transition from stochastic to deterministic behavior in calcium oscillations*. Biophysical Journal, 89:1603–1611, 2005.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
