To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConCORDe-Net: Cell Count Regularized Convolutional Neural Network for Cell Detection in Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Images" by Yeman Brhane Hagos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it mentions that the authors developed a method for cell detection and classification in multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset used in the study. Here, the authors describe that they used mIHC whole-tumor slide images from breast cancer patients. They mention that a total of 175 regions/patches were annotated from 6 whole-tumor images, which indicates the dataset's size and source.

In this section, the authors also provide a breakdown of how the patches were split into training, validation, and testing sets, along with the number of annotated cells belonging to five different cell classes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **Results section** to see if the authors mention any performance metrics related to the dataset, which can provide additional context about its significance and application.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: mIHC Whole-Tumor Slide Images
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of whole-tumor slide images from breast cancer patients, containing 175 annotated patches extracted from 6 different whole-tumor images. A total of 20,477 cells were annotated, belonging to five different cell classes.
   - **Cell Classes**: CD8, GAL8+ pSTAT-, GAL8+ pSTAT+ strong, GAL8+ pSTAT+ moderate, GAL8+ pSTAT+ weak.
   - **Data Split**: The dataset was split into training (120 patches), validation (28 patches), and testing (27 patches).

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection of images, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on original images from breast cancer patients and annotated by experts.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the context in which the dataset was used in the study. This will help in creating a comprehensive entry for the dataset without needing a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
