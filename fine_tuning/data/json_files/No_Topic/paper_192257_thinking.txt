To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Part Segmentation using Compositional Model combining Shape and Appearance" by Jianyu Wang and Alan Yuille, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using a "newly annotated dataset on Pascal VOC 2010," which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they use the Pascal VOC 2010 dataset, which provides pixelwise semantic part annotations for each object instance. They also clarify that they focus on fully observable animal instances, specifically horses and cows, and that they manually select these instances from the dataset.

I will then check the **related work** and **conclusion sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are further details about the Pascal VOC dataset's usage. However, it appears that the primary dataset used for their experiments is indeed the Pascal VOC 2010 dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Pascal VOC 2010 dataset. The citation is typically formatted as follows:

- For the Pascal VOC 2010 dataset, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Pascal VOC 2010 Dataset**: This dataset provides pixelwise semantic part annotations for various object instances, specifically focusing on fully observable animals in this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
