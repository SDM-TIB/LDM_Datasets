To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Immersive Video Compression using Implicit Neural Representations" by Ho Man Kwan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the proposed codec on **MPEG Immersive Video (MIV) Common Test Conditions**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors state that they employed **six mandatory test sequences in the MIV Common Test Conditions (CTC)** for testing. This indicates that the MIV CTC sequences are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for a detailed description of these sequences. The authors refer to the MIV CTC test sequences in the context of their experiments, but they do not provide specific names or details about each sequence in the main text. Therefore, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIV CTC test sequences.

In the references, I find the following citation for the MIV CTC test sequences:
- **MIV Common Test Conditions**: 
  > A. Dziembowski, B. Kroon, and J. Jung, “Common test conditions for MPEG immersive video.” ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 04, 2023.

Additionally, the authors mention that they compared their method against the **Test Model of MIV (TMIV)**, which is another dataset used for evaluation. I will also look for its citation in the references:
- **Test Model of MIV (TMIV)**:
  > G. L. Adrian Dziembowski, “Test model 17 for MPEG immersive video.” ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 4, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIV Common Test Conditions (CTC)**: Used for testing the proposed codec.
   - Citation: A. Dziembowski, B. Kroon, and J. Jung, “Common test conditions for MPEG immersive video.” ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 04, 2023.

2. **Test Model of MIV (TMIV)**: Used for comparison in the experiments.
   - Citation: G. L. Adrian Dziembowski, “Test model 17 for MPEG immersive video.” ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 4, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
