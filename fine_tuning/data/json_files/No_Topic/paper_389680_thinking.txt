To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizable Metric Network for Cross-domain Person Re-identification" by Lei Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Market1501**: This dataset consists of 1,501 persons and 32,668 images captured from six cameras, with a training set of 12,936 images of 751 identities.

2. **MSMT17**: This dataset contains 32,621 images of 1,041 identities in the training set, with additional query and gallery images.

3. **CUHK03-NP**: This dataset has 7,365 training images, with specific numbers of images allocated for query and gallery sets.

4. **CUHK-SYSU**: This dataset includes 11,934 persons and 34,574 images.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, pp. 1116–1124.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Wei, L., Zhang, S., Gao, W., & Tian, Q. (2018). *Person transfer gan to bridge domain gap for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, pp. 79–88.

- For **CUHK03-NP**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). *DeepReid: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014, pp. 152–159.

- For **CUHK-SYSU**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, T., Li, S., Wang, B., Lin, L., & Wang, X. (2016). *End-to-end deep learning for person search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.01850.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
