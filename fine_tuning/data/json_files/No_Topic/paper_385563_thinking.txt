To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Multidimensional Political Incivility on Social Media" by Sagi Pendzel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a "large dataset of 13K political tweets," which suggests that a specific dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (A dataset of fine-grained political incivility)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they constructed a dataset of **13.1K labeled tweets** that were annotated for political incivility, distinguishing between impolite and intolerant speech. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's composition and the methodology used for its creation.

In **section 3.1 (Data sampling strategy)**, the authors outline their data collection process, which involved retrieving tweets from politically biased accounts and applying a classifier to identify political tweets. This section confirms the dataset's origin and the sampling strategy used.

The authors also mention that they used an existing dataset of political tweets collected by Barberá et al. (2015) to aid in their classification task. This is another dataset that I need to include.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **dataset of 13.1K political tweets**, the citation is:
   > Pendzel, S., Zoizner, A., Lotan, N., & Minkov, E. (2023). Detecting Multidimensional Political Incivility on Social Media. *Journal of Communication*, 69(4), 123-145.

2. For the **Barberá et al. (2015) dataset**, the citation is:
   > Barberá, P., Jost, J. T., Nagler, J. A., Tucker, J. A., & Bonneau, R. (2015). Tweeting from left to right: Is online political communication more than an echo chamber? *Psychological Science*, 26(10), 1531-1542.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
