To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Dyadic Treatment Effects with Unknown Confounders" by Tadao Hoshino and Takahide Yanagi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors apply their method to **international trade data**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical analysis section** where the authors describe their application of the method. They mention that their dataset consists of **37 selected countries and regions in Asia, Oceania, and North America**. The outcome variables are the share of export and import amounts for the year 2021, which indicates that specific trade data is being used.

The authors specify that the data for exports and imports is obtained from the **World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), World Bank**. This is a crucial piece of information as it provides the source of the dataset.

Additionally, they mention that the treatment variable is based on **free trade agreements (FTAs)** related to the sample countries, and the data for FTAs is sourced from the **Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO)**. This indicates another dataset related to trade agreements.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **International Trade Data**:
   - Source: World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), World Bank.
   - Citation: World Bank. *World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)*. Available at: https://wits.worldbank.org.

2. **Free Trade Agreements Data**:
   - Source: Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).
   - Citation: Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). *FTAs List*. Available at: https://www.jetro.go.jp/theme/wto-fta/ftalist.html.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, which is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
