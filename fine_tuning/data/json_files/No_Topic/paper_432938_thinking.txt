To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context" by Jianyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the model is verified using **real bushfire data from NSW, Australia**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In the methodology, the authors describe using **real-world bushfire spread data** sourced from operational personnel involved in suppression operations during the 2019-2020 bushfire season in New South Wales. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their analysis.

In **Section 4 (Real Data on Bushfire Spread)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including its characteristics. They mention that the dataset includes the locations of fires that occurred during the specified bushfire season, and it is structured in a grid format with specific coordinates and time intervals for fire occurrences.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Bushfire Spread Dataset**: This dataset contains the locations of fires that occurred during the 2019-2020 bushfire season in New South Wales, Australia. The data is collected every 15 minutes and includes coordinates of fire locations within a grid map.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The authors reference the **Bureau of Meteorology Annual Climate Statement 2019** as a source for their model assumptions, which may also be relevant to the dataset used.

The full citation for the bushfire dataset is as follows:
> NSW (2023). Native vegetation. Retrieved from [NSW Government website](https://www.nsw.gov.au).

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
