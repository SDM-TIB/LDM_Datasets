To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Texture Generation Using Dual-Domain Feature Flow with Multi-View Hallucinations" by Seunggyu Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for datasets to validate their method, which indicates that datasets will be discussed later in the paper. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **DeepFashion In-shop Clothes Retrieval Benchmark**: This dataset is filtered to include 5,745 images of 1,628 different clothing items that are non-detectable by the human detector.

2. **iPER**: This dataset is referenced as a source for evaluating the model's performance, but further details may be found in the references.

3. **Fashion video collected from Amazon**: This dataset is mentioned but lacks specific details in the experiments section.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for the full citations corresponding to each dataset mentioned in the experiments:

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z.; Luo, P.; Qiu, S.; Wang, X.; and Tang, X. 2016. *DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1096–1104.

- For **iPER**, the citation is:
  > Liu, W.; Piao, Z.; Min, J.; Luo, W.; Ma, L.; and Gao, S. 2019. *iPER: Image-based Person Re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–10.

- For **Fashion video collected from Amazon**, the citation is:
  > Zablotskaia, P.; Siarohin, A.; Zhao, B.; and Sigal, L. 2019. *DwNet: Dense warp-based network for pose-guided human video generation*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), pages 1–12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
