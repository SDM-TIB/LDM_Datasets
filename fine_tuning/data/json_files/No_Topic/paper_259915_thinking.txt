To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Loss for Test-Time Augmentation" by Ildoo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet** datasets, specifically using their corrupted variants, **CIFAR-100-C** and **ImageNet-C**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **CIFAR-100** dataset, which consists of 60,000 images across 100 classes. They also mention the **CIFAR-100-C** dataset, which includes algorithmically generated corruptions of the original CIFAR-100 dataset. 

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **ImageNet** dataset, which contains 1.2 million natural images across 1,000 classes. They also refer to the **ImageNet-C** dataset, which consists of corrupted versions of the original ImageNet dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

3. **CIFAR-100-C Dataset**:
   > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

4. **ImageNet-C Dataset**:
   > Dan Hendrycks, N. Mu, E. D. Cubuk, B. Zoph, J. Gilmer, and B. Lakshminarayanan. *Augmix: A Simple Data Processing Method to Improve Robustness and Uncertainty*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.02781, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
