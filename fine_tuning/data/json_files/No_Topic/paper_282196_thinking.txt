To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning non-Gaussian graphical models via Hessian scores and triangular transport" by Ricardo Baptista et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various examples and applications of their proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets they refer to while discussing their experiments or results. If they mention datasets like "butterfly distribution," "Penn Action Dataset," or any other specific datasets, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention the "butterfly distribution," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is a commonly used example in the literature and may not have a formal citation.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction.
