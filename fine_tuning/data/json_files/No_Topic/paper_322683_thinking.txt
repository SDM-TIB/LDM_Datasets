To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hole-robust Wireframe Detection" by Naejin Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Wireframe test set** and the **York Urban dataset** for their evaluations. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and any modifications made for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide quantitative results based on these datasets, confirming their use. They also mention the conditions under which the datasets were tested, such as with and without holes.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

1. **Wireframe Test Set**: The citation is:
   > Kun Huang, Yifan Wang, Zihan Zhou, Tianjiao Ding, Shenghua Gao, and Yi Ma. *Learning to parse wireframes in images of man-made environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 626–635, 2018.

2. **York Urban Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Patrick Denis, James H Elder, and Francisco J Estrada. *Efficient edge-based methods for estimating Manhattan frames in urban imagery*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 197–210. Springer, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their characteristics and the full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
