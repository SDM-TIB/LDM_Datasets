To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Creating a Culture of Constructive Criticism in Computational Legal Studies" by Corinna Coupette and Dirk Hartung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the need for data and code availability, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific mentions.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss the challenges in computational legal studies, including issues with data availability and quality. However, they do not mention specific datasets in this section.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or results sections**. In this paper, there is no explicit section labeled "Datasets," but the authors emphasize the importance of releasing data and code for reproducibility. They mention that ideally, all data should be released, including raw data, preprocessed data, and result data. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references include various papers discussing data sharing and reproducibility, but they do not point to specific datasets used in the authors' research.

Given that the paper focuses more on principles and practices rather than specific datasets, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. The authors advocate for a culture of sharing data and code but do not provide concrete examples or references to datasets.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This highlights a gap in the paper regarding the practical application of their principles, as they call for data sharing but do not exemplify it with actual datasets.
