To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novelty Driven Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search" by Nilotpal Sinha and Kuan-Wen Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, NEvoNAS, is evaluated on two different search spaces, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Search Spaces)** and **subsection 4.2 (Dataset)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The paper states that CIFAR-10 consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, classified into 10 classes. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it is classified into 100 classes. This dataset is also used for performance evaluation.

3. **ImageNet**: The authors mention ImageNet as a well-known benchmark for image classification, containing 1,000 classes with 1.28 million training images and 50,000 test images. This dataset is significant for assessing the generalization of the discovered architectures.

4. **ImageNet-16-120**: This is a down-sampled variant of ImageNet, where the original images are resized to 16x16 pixels. The authors provide details about the number of training, validation, and test images for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: a large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-16-120**, the citation is:
  > Patryk Chrabaszcz, Ilya Loshchilov, and Frank Hutter. *A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
