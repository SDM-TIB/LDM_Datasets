To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid and Collaborative Passage Reranking" by Zongmeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their content or structure.

Upon reviewing section 3.1, I find three datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Natural Questions**: This dataset consists of real English questions from Google search engine with golden passages from English Wikipedia pages and answer span annotations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Kelcey, M., Chang, M. W., Dai, A. M., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., & Petrov, S. (2019). Natural questions: A benchmark for question answering research. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 7, 452-466.

2. **MS MARCO**: This dataset includes English queries from Bing search logs and was originally designed for machine reading comprehension. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bajaj, P., Campos, D., Craswell, N., Deng, L., Gao, J., Liu, X., Majumder, R., McNamara, A., Mitra, B., Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Stoica, A., Tiwary, S., & Wang, T. (2018). MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268*.

3. **TREC 2019/2020**: These datasets originate from the TREC 2019/2020 Deep Learning Track, providing additional Bing search queries and requiring the retrieval of passages from the MS MARCO corpus. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Craswell, N., Mitra, B., Yilmaz, E., & Campos, D. (2020a). Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track. In *Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Text REtrieval Conference* (TREC 2020).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations and any additional details that may be relevant for each dataset, such as their licensing information or specific characteristics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
