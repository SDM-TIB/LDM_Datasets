To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Extended Object Tracking Using Coupled Velocity Model from WLS Perspective" by Zhifei Li, Yan Liang, and Linfeng Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in extended object tracking and mention various models and approaches. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point. I will then proceed to the **methodology** section, where the authors are likely to detail their experiments and the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced. If the authors mention datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to provide their standard citations. If they introduce new datasets, I will summarize their details and provide the citation as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and easy reference.

Throughout this process, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets, including their purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that the authors highlight in their research.
