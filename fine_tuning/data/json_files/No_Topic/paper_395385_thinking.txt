To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Methods for Acquiring and Incorporating Knowledge into Stock Price Prediction: A Survey" by Liping Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The introduction discusses various types of knowledge used in stock price prediction, which suggests that there may be multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets throughout the paper. In this case, I will focus on **Section 5 (Datasets of Knowledge-Enhanced Stock Price Prediction)**, where the authors provide a compilation of relevant datasets.

In **Section 5.1 (Public Financial Domain-Specific KBs)**, the authors list several knowledge bases, including:

1. **FR2KG**: A Chinese financial knowledge graph with 10 entity types and 19 relation types.
   - Citation: Wenguang Wang et al. (2021). "Data set and evaluation of automated construction of financial knowledge graph." *Data Intelligence*, 3(3), 418–443.

2. **ShanghaiTech University KG**: A financial event knowledge graph with 441,127 pieces of knowledge.
   - Citation: Kaihao Guo et al. (2020). "Knowledge graph enhanced event extraction in financial documents." In *2020 IEEE Intl. Conf. on Big Data*, 1322–1329.

3. **Chinese RE datasets in Finance**: Datasets for relation extraction tasks.
   - Citation: Haoyu Wu et al. (2020). "Creating a large-scale financial news corpus for relation extraction." In *2020 3rd Intl. Conf. on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data*, 259–263.

4. **Duee-Fin**: A large-scale benchmark knowledge base for event extraction.
   - Citation: Hang Yang et al. (2018). "DCFE: a document-level Chinese financial event extraction system based on automatically labeled training data." In *ACL 2018*, System Demonstrations, 50–55.

5. **HiDy**: A dynamic financial knowledge base with 34 relation types and over 492,600 relations.
   - Citation: K-Quant (2023). "K-Quant: a platform of temporal financial knowledge-enhanced quantitative investment." (2023).

In **Section 5.2 (Open-domain KBs)**, the authors mention:

1. **Wikidata**: A large-scale open-domain knowledge base.
   - Citation: Denny Vrandečić and Markus Krótzsch (2014). "Wikidata: a free collaborative knowledgebase." *Communications of the ACM*, 57(10), 78–85.

2. **GKG**: A comprehensive network connecting individuals, organizations, locations, events, and themes from global news sources.
   - Citation: GDELT Project (2023). "GDELT Event DB." Available at: https://analysis.gdeltproject.org/module-event-timeline.html.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately as they are crucial for referencing in any further work or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly listed with its corresponding citation for easy reference.
