To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Mexico" by Michelle Anzarut et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions fitting a Bayesian hierarchical model to describe the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico, which suggests that data related to COVID-19 cases and deaths will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe their data sources. Here, they mention using:

1. **Open data from the Dirección General de Epidemiología**: This dataset includes deaths and reported cases of COVID-19 in Mexico.
2. **Population counts provided by Víctor M. García**: This dataset is used for demographic information, particularly for age groups over 65 years old.
3. **Google mobility data**: This dataset is used to assess the impact of human mobility on the reproduction number of COVID-19.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Open data from the Dirección General de Epidemiología**, the citation is:
  > Dirección General de Epidemiología. *Open data on COVID-19 cases in Mexico*. Accessed July 9, 2020. https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127.

- For the **population counts provided by Víctor M. García**, the citation is:
  > García, V. M. *Population projections for 2020*. Accessed May 20, 2020.

- For the **Google mobility data**, the citation is:
  > Google. *COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports*. Accessed July 9, 2020. https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
