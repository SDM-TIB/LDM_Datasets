To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retro: Reusing teacher projection head for efficient embedding distillation on Lightweight Models via Self-supervised Learning" by Khanh-Binh Nguyen and Chae Jung Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of self-supervised learning and lightweight models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors mention pre-training their models on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to note its details.

In addition, the authors refer to using the **COCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets for evaluation in the context of object detection and instance segmentation tasks. I will ensure to capture these datasets as well.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252.

2. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., et al. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, Springer, pp. 740–755.

3. For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Eslami, S. A., Van Gool, L., et al. (2015). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1), 98–136.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
