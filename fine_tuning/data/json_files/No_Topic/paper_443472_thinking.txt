To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online detection and infographic explanation of spam reviews with data drift adaptation" by Francisco DE ARRIBA-PÃ‰REZ et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of spam detection and may reference specific datasets that have been used in previous studies or that they are using in their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that they mention two datasets:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of 359,052 leisure activity entries, with 36,885 labeled as spam and 322,167 as non-spam. This dataset is crucial for their spam detection experiments.

2. **MediaWiki Dataset**: This dataset contains 319,856 entries from travel wikis, with 24,877 labeled as spam and 294,979 as non-spam. This dataset is also used for evaluating their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides the following citations:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abidmeeraj/yelp-labelled-dataset?select=Labelled+Yelp+Dataset.csv, May 2024.

- For the **MediaWiki Dataset**, the authors mention that it is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, so I will note that as well.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: A dataset containing 359,052 leisure activity entries, with 36,885 spam and 322,167 non-spam entries.
   - Citation: Available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abidmeeraj/yelp-labelled-dataset?select=Labelled+Yelp+Dataset.csv, May 2024.

2. **MediaWiki Dataset**: A dataset comprising 319,856 entries from travel wikis, with 24,877 spam and 294,979 non-spam entries.
   - Citation: Available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
