To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grandes Fraudes y Gobiernos Corporativos en la Economía desde Mediados del Siglo XX" by Inés Martín de Santos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the study's focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail datasets, such as **methodology or data sources**. In this paper, the author discusses various economic frauds and their implications, but I need to pinpoint any datasets that are explicitly referenced.

In the **section discussing economic frauds**, the author mentions the use of data from **INEbase**, which is a database maintained by the National Statistics Institute of Spain. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically related to economic crimes and fraud statistics.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the INEbase dataset. The citation should include the title of the dataset, the organization responsible for it, and any relevant publication details.

The citation for the INEbase dataset is:
> Instituto Nacional de Estadística. INEbase. Delitos. https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=25997 [Consulta 18/06/2020].

Now, I will summarize the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **INEbase Dataset**: This dataset contains statistics on various types of crimes, including economic frauds, and is updated regularly by the National Statistics Institute of Spain.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
