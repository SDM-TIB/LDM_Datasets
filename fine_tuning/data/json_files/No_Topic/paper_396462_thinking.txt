To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Granularized Barrett’s Esophagus Diagnosis Classification" by Jenna Kefeli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used pathology reports from Columbia University Irving Medical Center, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Results)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Characterization of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) Pathology Report Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of endoscopy pathology reports from patients who underwent surveillance for Barrett’s esophagus between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020. They mention that the final dataset contained **619 pathology reports corresponding to 214 patients**, which is crucial information.

In this section, I will also note that the dataset was manually annotated by gastroenterologists to generate a gold standard for BE-related diagnoses. This indicates the dataset's reliability and the effort put into its creation.

I will also check the **Methods section** to ensure I have all the necessary details about how the dataset was processed and utilized. The authors mention that the dataset was split into development and validation sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from pathology reports and is not publicly available due to protected health information (PHI), there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on internal reports from Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Given this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Barrett’s Esophagus Pathology Report Dataset**: This dataset consists of 619 pathology reports from 214 patients who underwent surveillance for Barrett’s esophagus at Columbia University Irving Medical Center between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020. The reports were manually annotated by gastroenterologists to create a gold standard for BE-related diagnoses.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset due to its proprietary nature, I will note that it is based on internal data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset.
