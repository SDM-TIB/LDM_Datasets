To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Approach to Encoding Context for Spoken Language Understanding" by Raghav Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of dialogues from two domains, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to them in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Simulated Dialogues dataset**, which is crucial for my extraction. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the number of dialogues and turns.

In section 3.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Simulated Dialogues dataset**. They specify that it includes dialogues from restaurant and movie domains, with a total of 12 slot types and 21 user dialogue act types. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Simulated Dialogues dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For the **Simulated Dialogues dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Shah, D. Hakkani-TÃ¼r, G. Tur, A. Rastogi, A. Bapna, N. Nayak, and L. Heck. *Building a conversational agent overnight with dialogue self-play*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.04871, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
