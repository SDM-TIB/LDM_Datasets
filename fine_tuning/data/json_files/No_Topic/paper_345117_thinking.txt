To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chordal Sparsity for SDP-based Neural Network Verification" by Anton Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting numerical experiments on real networks of learned cart-pole dynamics. This indicates that there may be specific datasets related to this experiment.

I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using parameters from previous works to simulate trained neural networks with ReLU activations, specifically for the cart-pole dynamics. This suggests that there might be datasets or benchmarks related to cart-pole dynamics that are referenced.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for documenting the datasets accurately. If the authors refer to datasets from other works, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset related to cart-pole dynamics, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If they mention specific parameters or configurations, I will note those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset information is clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
