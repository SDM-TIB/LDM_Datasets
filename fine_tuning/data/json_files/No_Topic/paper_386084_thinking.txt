To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Emergency Disposal Decision-making Method with Humanâ€“Machine Collaboration" by Yibo Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and the data used for validation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that indicate the datasets utilized in the research.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics of the datasets. If the authors refer to datasets by acronyms or shorthand, I will ensure to clarify their full names.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for each dataset. I will extract the complete citation for each dataset, ensuring to include all authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" and provides a citation, I will format it correctly as follows:
> Author(s). "Title of the Dataset Paper." Journal/Conference Name, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key aspects of each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any unique features.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured clearly for easy reference in future work or analysis.
