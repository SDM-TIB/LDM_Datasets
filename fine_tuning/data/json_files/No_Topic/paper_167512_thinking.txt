To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Learn a Model Checker" by Dung Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Models and Case Studies)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors discuss three well-established benchmarks in the hybrid systems community:

1. **Inverted Pendulum Dataset (IP-DS)**: The authors mention three datasets related to the inverted pendulum model, with varying sample sizes and positive sample percentages. The datasets are:
   - IP-DS-1: 10,000 samples, 34.85% positive, adaptive training.
   - IP-DS-2: 20,000 samples, 40.8% positive, adaptive training.
   - IP-DS-3: 10,000 samples, 12.5% positive, uniform test.

2. **Spiking Neuron Dataset (SN-DS)**: Similar to the inverted pendulum, the authors describe three datasets for the spiking neuron model:
   - SN-DS-1: 10,000 samples, 53.97% positive, uniform training.
   - SN-DS-2: 20,000 samples, 54.02% positive, uniform training.
   - SN-DS-3: 10,000 samples, 54.73% positive, uniform test.

3. **Quadcopter Dataset (QC-DS)**: The authors also provide details on three datasets for the quadcopter model:
   - QC-DS-1: 10,000 samples, 47.47% positive, adaptive training.
   - QC-DS-2: 20,000 samples, 46.99% positive, adaptive training.
   - QC-DS-3: 10,000 samples, 72.19% positive, uniform test.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Inverted Pendulum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Derya Aksaray, Austin Jones, Zhaodan Kong, Mac Schwager, and Calin Belta. *Q-learning for robust satisfaction of signal temporal logic specifications*. In Decision and Control (CDC), 2016 IEEE 55th Conference on, pages 6565â€“6570, 2016.

- For the **Spiking Neuron Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eugene M. Izhikevich. *Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting*. The MIT Press, 2007.

- For the **Quadcopter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2017. dReal Quadcopter Model Benchmark. (2017). http://dreal.github.io/benchmarks/quad/

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
