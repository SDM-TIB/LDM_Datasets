To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Bootstrapping Machine Learning Performance Predictors via Analytical Models" by Diego Didona and Paolo Romano, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the investigation of a technique called Bootstrapping, which suggests that there may be datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or case studies in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experimental evaluation section (Section IV)**, as this is likely where the authors describe the datasets used in their case studies. In this section, the authors mention two case studies: a **Key-Value Store (Infinispan)** and a **Total Order Broadcast (TOB)** service. I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets associated with these case studies.

In the **case studies subsection (IV-A)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **Key-Value Store (Infinispan)**: The dataset consists of approximately **900 samples** collected from a private Cloud infrastructure, with specific configurations and workloads described. The authors mention that the dataset was generated using a transactional porting of YCSB (Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark).

2. **Total Order Broadcast (TOB)**: The dataset contains a total of **500 observations**, which were drawn from a cluster of 10 machines. The authors describe how the batching level and message arrival rates were varied during the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The YCSB benchmark is a well-known dataset, and I will ensure to include its citation as well.

- For the **YCSB dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. F. Cooper et al. *Benchmarking cloud serving systems with ycsb*. In Proc. of SOCC, 2010.

- For the **Infinispan**, the citation is:
  > F. Marchioni and M. Surtani. *Infinispan Data Grid Platform*. Packt Publishing, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
