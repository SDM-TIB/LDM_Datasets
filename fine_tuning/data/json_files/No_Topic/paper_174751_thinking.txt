To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Focus Image Fusion using Sparse Representation and Coupled Dictionary Learning" by Farshad G. Veshki and Sergiy A. Vorobyov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and the proposed solution, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. For instance, they mention using a "multi-focus dataset" and "Lytro dataset" for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as the number of images, types of images, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide visual comparisons and quantitative evaluations based on the datasets. They mention using six pairs of gray-scale multi-focus images and four triple series of color multi-focus images taken from the Lytro dataset. This indicates that the datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Lytro dataset and other datasets used in their comparisons. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for the Lytro dataset and any other datasets referenced in the paper.

The relevant citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **Lytro dataset**, the citation is:
   > [29] ¡http://mansournejati.ece.iut.ac.ir/content/lytro-multi-focus-dataset¿.

2. For the **standard multi-focus dataset**, the citation is:
   > [17] M. Nejati, S. Samavi, and S. Hirani, “Multi-focus image fusion using dictionary-based sparse representation,” Inf. Fusion, vol. 25, pp. 72–84, Sep. 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
