To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arc-Standard Spinal Parsing with Stack-LSTMs" by Miguel Ballesteros and Xavier Carreras, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their method and reference previous works but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they used the **Penn Treebank** for their experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. They also mention that they used standard splits of this dataset, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the **Penn Treebank** in the **References section**. The citation provided is:
> Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary A. Marcinkiewicz. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Penn Treebank** using the required format, ensuring to include the full citation as noted above.

This process has allowed me to systematically identify and extract the relevant dataset from the paper while ensuring that I have the necessary citation for proper attribution.
