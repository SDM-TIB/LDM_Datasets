To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-resolution global irrigation prediction with Sentinel-2 30m data" by Weixin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model for irrigation predictions using satellite data, which suggests that datasets related to satellite imagery and climate data might be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for accurate global irrigation data and mention the use of satellite data for their analysis. This section may provide insights into the datasets they utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **data sources section (3.1)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their research. They state that they used **Sentinel-2 satellite data** for high-resolution irrigation mapping and **TerraClimate** for climate data. They also refer to the **GFSAD30 global cropland map** to filter non-cropland areas from their analysis.

1. **Sentinel-2 Data**: The authors describe using Sentinel-2 satellite data, which provides multispectral imagery at various resolutions. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of cropland vegetation coverage.

2. **TerraClimate Data**: This dataset provides global monthly climate data at a resolution of approximately 4.2 km, which is used in conjunction with the irrigation model.

3. **GFSAD30 Global Cropland Map**: This dataset is used to identify areas of cropland and non-cropland, which is essential for the accuracy of their irrigation predictions.

In the **evaluation methodology section (4)**, the authors mention using crowdsourced irrigation data from **croplands.org** for validation purposes. This dataset is important for assessing the accuracy of their model predictions.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:
