To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Political Conflict and Economic Growth in Post-Independence Venezuela" by Dorothy Kronick and Francisco RodrÃ­guez, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main sections for specific dataset references.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain empirical data or analyses, such as **results, discussions, or any dedicated sections on data or methodology**. I will pay special attention to any figures, tables, or references to datasets that may be included in these sections.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to economic indicators, historical data, or specific datasets used for analysis, I will document these carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as the full citation provides the necessary context and source information for each dataset.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the **Maddison Project Database** for GDP estimates, I will ensure to note the complete citation:
> Angus Maddison. *Monitoring the World Economy, 1820-1992*. Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 1995.

Similarly, if they refer to any other datasets or sources, I will extract their full citations in the same manner.

Once I have compiled a list of datasets along with their full citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for further processing or review.
