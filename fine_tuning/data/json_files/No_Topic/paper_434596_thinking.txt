To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-linear Welfare-Aware Strategic Learning" by Tian Xie and Xueru Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction typically discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often includes detailed information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including any synthetic datasets created for the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset consists of 10,000 independent samples generated from multivariate Gaussian distributions, with a quadratic labeling function. The authors describe the features and the sensitive attribute involved.

2. **ACSIncome-CA Dataset**: This dataset contains income-related data for California residents, specifically focusing on whether an agent's annual income exceeds $50,000. The authors mention that they randomly selected 20,000 samples from the 2018 data.

3. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,000 samples where the label indicates whether an agent's credit risk is high or low. The authors reference preprocessing done by another study, which is important for citation purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Synthetic Data**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note it as:
  > Tian Xie and Xueru Zhang. *Synthetic Data for Non-linear Welfare-Aware Strategic Learning*. 2024.

- For the **ACSIncome-CA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Frances Ding, Moritz Hardt, John Miller, and Ludwig Schmidt. *Retiring Adult: New Datasets for Fair Machine Learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:6478â€“6490, 2021.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017. URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
