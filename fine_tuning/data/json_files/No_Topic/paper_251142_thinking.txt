To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-Reversal Symmetric ODE Network" by Eunho Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. This section discusses the context and motivation for the research but does not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several experiments involving different dynamical systems, but they do not explicitly name any datasets in the text.

To ensure I do not miss any details, I will also check the **figures and tables** within the experiments section. Figures may contain visual representations of data or results that could hint at the datasets used. However, upon reviewing the figures, it appears they illustrate results rather than specific datasets.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to identify any datasets that might have been cited indirectly. The authors reference various works, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments using synthetic data generated from known dynamical systems (e.g., Dufﬁng oscillators) and real-world data from a previous study. The real-world data is cited as follows:

- For the real-world dynamics experiment, the citation is:
  > Michael Schmidt and Hod Lipson. *Distilling free-form natural laws from experimental data*. Science, 324(5923):81–85, 2009.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the synthetic data, I will note that the experiments were conducted using generated data based on the Dufﬁng oscillator equations.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Data**: Generated from the Dufﬁng oscillator equations (no specific citation).
2. **Real-World Data**: 
   > Michael Schmidt and Hod Lipson. *Distilling free-form natural laws from experimental data*. Science, 324(5923):81–85, 2009.

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets referenced in the research paper.
