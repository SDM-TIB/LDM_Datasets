To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Interactions between Target Positive and Negative Information for Acoustic Echo Cancellation" by Chang Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction may give context about the datasets used, particularly if they are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that their model is trained with **9500 synthetic files from the database provided by Microsoft for the ICASSP 2022 AEC Challenge**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

I will also note that they mention using **10,000 near-end speech utterances from the 2022 official synthetic dataset** and **10,000 utterances from the 2021 ICASSP AEC-challenge synthetic dataset** for training. This is important as it specifies the sources of the datasets.

Additionally, they refer to the **DNS dataset** for background noise, which is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **ICASSP 2022 AEC Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Cutler, A. Saabas, T. Parnamaa, M. Purin, H. Gamper, S. Braun, K. Sorensen, and R. Aichner. *Icassp 2022 acoustic echo cancellation challenge*. In ICASSP 2022, 2022.

2. For the **2021 ICASSP AEC-challenge synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
   > K. Sridhar, R. Cutler, A. Saabas, T. Parnamaa, M. Loide, H. Gamper, S. Braun, R. Aichner, and S. Srinivasan. *Icassp 2021 acoustic echo cancellation challenge: Datasets, testing framework, and results*. In ICASSP 2021, 2021.

3. For the **DNS dataset**, the citation is:
   > C. K. Reddy, H. Dubey, K. Koishida, A. Nair, V. Gopal, R. Cutler, S. Braun, H. Gamper, R. Aichner, and S. Srinivasan. *Interspeech 2021 deep noise suppression challenge*. In INTERSPEECH, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
