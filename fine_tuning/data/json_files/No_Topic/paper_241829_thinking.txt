To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Survival in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Saeed Moazami and Peggy Doerschuk, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a model-based reinforcement learning method, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in experiments. The introduction provides context about reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. 

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any mention of specific environments or datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm. In this section, the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym CartPole environment** for evaluating their method. This indicates that the dataset or environment used is the CartPole, which is a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the performance of their algorithm in the CartPole environment. They compare their method against existing algorithms but do not introduce any new datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CartPole environment. The CartPole environment is part of the OpenAI Gym, which is referenced in the paper. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CartPole environment and does not mention any additional datasets, I will create an entry for the CartPole dataset using the information gathered.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for review or downstream processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the CartPole environment.
