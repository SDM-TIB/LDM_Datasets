To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear Quality of Life Index" by Andrei Zinovyev and Alexander N. Gorban, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions an analysis of the nonlinear quality of life index for **171 countries**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the indicators used to construct the quality of life index. They specifically mention using four indicators sourced from **GAPMINDER** for the year 2005:

1. **Gross Domestic Product per capita by Purchasing Power Parities**
2. **Life expectancy at birth**
3. **Infant Mortality Rate (per 1000 born)**
4. **Infectious Tuberculosis incidence (new cases per 100,000 of population)**

These indicators suggest that there is a dataset that includes these variables for the 171 countries analyzed.

I will then look for any explicit references to the dataset in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors mention that they used publicly available data from **GAPMINDER**, which confirms the source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GAPMINDER dataset. The paper cites GAPMINDER as a dynamic and interactive data visualization tool and database of socio-economic indicators collected over 200 years of world history. The reference is:

> GAPMINDER. (n.d.). Dynamic and interactive data visualization tool and a database of socio-economical indicators collected for 200 years of the world history. Retrieved from http://www.gapminder.org/

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **GAPMINDER Dataset**: Contains socio-economic indicators for 171 countries, including GDP per capita, life expectancy, infant mortality rate, and tuberculosis incidence for the year 2005.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review.
