To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Competitive Sports: Bradley-Terry-Él˝o Models for Supervised and On-Line Learning of Paired Competition Outcomes" by Franz J. Király and Zhaozhi Qian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe their experiments, including the datasets they utilized for validation and testing. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **English Premier League dataset**, which consists of historical match data from the league. They specify that the dataset includes match outcomes, teams, and other relevant features. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the time frame (1993-2015) and the total number of matches (8524).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The authors may reference original sources or repositories where the datasets can be found.

For the **English Premier League dataset**, the citation is:
> The Premier League. *About the Premier League*. http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/about/the-worlds-most-watched-league.html, 2016. Accessed: 2016-06-26.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the research.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Focusing on the experiments section for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Checking the references for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
