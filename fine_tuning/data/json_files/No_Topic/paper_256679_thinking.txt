To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CASTLE: Regularization via Auxiliary Causal Graph Discovery" by Trent Kyono et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "plethora of synthetic and real publicly available datasets," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors detail their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using various datasets for their experiments, specifically in **subsection 4.2 (Regularization on Real Data)**. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names and their characteristics.

In this section, the authors list several datasets used for regression and classification tasks, including:

1. **Boston Housing (BH)**: A dataset containing 506 samples with 14 features, used for predicting housing prices.
2. **Wine Quality (WQ)**: A dataset with 4894 samples and 12 features, used for predicting wine quality.
3. **Facebook Metrics (FB)**: A dataset with 500 samples and 19 features, used for analyzing Facebook metrics.
4. **Bioconcentration (BC)**: A dataset with 779 samples and 14 features, used for bioconcentration predictions.
5. **Student Performance (SP)**: A dataset with 649 samples and 33 features, used for predicting student performance.
6. **Community and Crime (CM)**: A dataset with 1994 samples and 128 features, used for crime analysis.
7. **Contraceptive Choice (CC)**: A dataset with 1472 samples and 9 features, used for predicting contraceptive choices.
8. **Pima Diabetes (PD)**: A dataset with 768 samples and 9 features, used for diabetes prediction.
9. **Las Vegas Ratings (LV)**: A dataset with 504 samples and 20 features, used for rating Las Vegas services.
10. **Statlog Heart (SH)**: A dataset with 270 samples and 13 features, used for heart disease prediction.
11. **Retinopathy (RP)**: A dataset with 1151 samples and 20 features, used for predicting retinopathy.
12. **Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (ME)**: A dataset with 15786 samples and 139 features, used for healthcare expenditure analysis.
13. **Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MG)**: A dataset with 40367 samples and 33 features, used for heart failure analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, as they are commonly known datasets in the machine learning community.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, while also noting that full citations may not be available for all datasets since they are widely recognized in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
