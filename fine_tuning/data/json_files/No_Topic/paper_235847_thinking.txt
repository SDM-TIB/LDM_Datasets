To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharpe Ratio Analysis in High Dimensions: Residual-Based Nodewise Regression in Factor Models" by Mehmet Caner, Marcelo Medeiros, and Gabriel F. R. Vasconcelos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section often includes details about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any sections that discuss empirical applications or experiments, as these often contain references to the datasets utilized. For example, the authors mention using data from the S&P 500 index, which is a well-known dataset in financial research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets mentioned in this paper, I will note the following:

1. **S&P 500 Index Data**: The authors mention using data from the S&P 500 index for their empirical analysis. This dataset includes stock prices and returns for companies listed in the S&P 500 index over a specified time period.

   Citation:
   > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index Data*. Available at: [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/).

2. **Simulation Data**: The authors also describe a simulation process based on a simplified version of the factor model, which generates synthetic datasets for testing their methodology.

3. **Block Diagonal Covariance Matrix**: The paper discusses the use of a block diagonal covariance matrix for simulations, which is a common approach in financial modeling.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
