To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuRoRA: Neural Robust Rotation Averaging" by Pulak Purkait et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a neural network for rotation averaging, but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may reference datasets used for training or evaluation. Here, I will look for any mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. They mention a **synthetic dataset** consisting of 1200 sparse view-graphs, which were generated with specific characteristics. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed method.

Additionally, the authors discuss **real datasets** in detail, specifically mentioning 19 publicly available view-graphs with observed noisy relative orientations and ground-truth absolute orientations. They provide a table summarizing these datasets, which includes names and characteristics.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 1200 sparse view-graphs generated with varying numbers of cameras and noise levels.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper, as it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors.

2. **Real Datasets**: 
   - **TNotreDame Dataset**: Shared by Chatterjee et al. (2017).
     - Citation: Chatterjee, A., & Govindu, V. M. (2017). Robust relative rotation averaging. *TPAMI*, 40(4), 958-972.
   - **Artsquad Dataset**: Provided by DISCO.
     - Citation: DISCO. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/disco/
   - **SanFrancisco Dataset**: Also provided by DISCO.
     - Citation: DISCO. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/disco/
   - Other datasets are shared by 1DSFM.
     - Citation: 1DSFM. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/1dsfm/

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their details accurately, including the citations for the real datasets, as they are essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
