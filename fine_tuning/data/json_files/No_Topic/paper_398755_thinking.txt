To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drift Analysis with Fitness Levels for Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms" by Jun He and Yuren Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for evaluation, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including any tables or figures that may summarize this information.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that the datasets mentioned are indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture both the dataset name and its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work. This structured output will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is readily available.
