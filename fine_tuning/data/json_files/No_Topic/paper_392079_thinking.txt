To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UX Heuristics and Checklist for Deep Learning powered Mobile Applications with Image Classification" by Christiane Gresse von Wangenheim and Gustavo Dirschnabel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of heuristics and a checklist for designing mobile applications with image classification, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background and research methodology sections**. In these sections, the authors describe their exploratory and experimental stages, including a review of literature and an analysis of 100 randomly selected mobile applications with image classification available on Google Play. However, they do not specify any datasets used in their research.

I will also check the **results and conclusion sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The paper focuses on the development of heuristics and guidelines rather than on specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the design and evaluation of mobile applications with image classification, it does not reference any datasets that can be cited. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile or format in the specified structure.
