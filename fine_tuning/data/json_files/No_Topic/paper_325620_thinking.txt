To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Stance Detection of Tweets Via Distant Network Supervision" by Subhabrata Dutta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors prepared two new tweet datasets comprising over 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India). This suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they collected. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **StanceUS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 59,684 tweets from 24,490 users in the US, collected between January 1, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The tweets are annotated with stance labels related to political parties.

2. **StanceIN Dataset**: This dataset includes 176,619 tweets from 63,230 users in India, collected from October 26, 2019, to March 2, 2020. Similar to the US dataset, these tweets are also annotated with stance labels concerning Indian political parties.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that they created these datasets themselves, so I will need to format the citations accordingly.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **StanceUS Dataset**:
  > Dutta, S., Caur, S., Chakrabarti, S., & Chakraborty, T. (2022). *Semi-supervised Stance Detection of Tweets Via Distant Network Supervision*. In Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM ’22), February 21–25, 2022, Tempe, AZ, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3488560.3498511

- For **StanceIN Dataset**:
  > Dutta, S., Caur, S., Chakrabarti, S., & Chakraborty, T. (2022). *Semi-supervised Stance Detection of Tweets Via Distant Network Supervision*. In Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM ’22), February 21–25, 2022, Tempe, AZ, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3488560.3498511

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or processing.
