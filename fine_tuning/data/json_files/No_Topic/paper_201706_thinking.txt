To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Characterwise Windowed Approach to Hebrew Morphological Segmentation" by Amir Zeldes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper achieves high accuracy on benchmark data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **SPMRL Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Hebrew Treebank and contains approximately 94,000 super-tokens for training and around 21,000 for testing and development. It is used as a benchmark for Hebrew morphological segmentation.

2. **Wiki5K Dataset**: This is a new out-of-domain dataset constructed from Hebrew Wikipedia NER data, consisting of 5,000 super-tokens (7,100 sub-tokens) that were manually segmented for evaluation purposes.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **SPMRL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khalil Sima’an, Alon Itai, Yoad Winter, Alon Altman, and Noa Nativ. *Building a tree-bank of Modern Hebrew text*. Traitment Automatique des Langues, 42:347–380, 2001.

- For the **Wiki5K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rami Al-Rfou, Vivek Kulkarni, Bryan Perozzi, and Steven Skiena. *Polyglot-NER: Massive multilingual named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, Vancouver, Canada.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
