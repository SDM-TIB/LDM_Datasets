To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Vehicle Coordination and Lane Switching without Switching of Controllers" by Arno Frauenfelder, Adrian Wiltz, and Dimos V. Dimarogonas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe a simulation example in the experiments section, which may include details about the datasets used for validation.

I will pay close attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or provide parameters related to them. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of vehicles, simulation parameters, or specific scenarios.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "Simulation Parameters" or "Vehicle Dynamics Model," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. If they are based on existing datasets, I will ensure to cite the original authors correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in this research paper.
