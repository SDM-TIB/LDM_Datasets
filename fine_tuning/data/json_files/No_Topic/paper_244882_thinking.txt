To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Polarimetric Image Augmentation" by Marc Blanchon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for a good and large dataset illustrating hazardous areas, which suggests that datasets are indeed discussed. In the introduction, the authors highlight the lack of polarimetric datasets available for training deep learning models, indicating that they may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their training dataset, which consists of 178 images that are augmented to create a larger dataset of 2136 images. They also mention a test dataset comprising 8,049 images acquired from a specific camera setup.

I will note the details of the datasets mentioned:

1. **Training Dataset**: The authors state that the training dataset is composed of 178 images, which are augmented to create a larger dataset. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will refer to it as the "Polarimetric Training Dataset" for clarity.

2. **Test Dataset**: The test dataset is described as a video sequence of 8,049 images acquired using the Trioptics PolarCam 4D Technology V polarimetric camera mounted on a robot. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their augmentation method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets they created or used, but they do reference other datasets in the context of their discussion about the lack of polarimetric datasets.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets they created, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

- **Polarimetric Training Dataset**: A dataset of 178 images augmented to 2136 images for training purposes. No specific citation is provided.
  
- **Test Dataset**: A video sequence of 8,049 images acquired using the Trioptics PolarCam 4D Technology V. No specific citation is provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to note that while the authors discuss the datasets, they do not provide formal citations for them. This is important to highlight, as it affects the completeness of the dataset extraction process.

In conclusion, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, noting the lack of formal citations for the training and test datasets, and prepare to present this information in a structured manner.
