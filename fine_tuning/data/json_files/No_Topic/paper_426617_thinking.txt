To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRF-Supervised Feature Point Detection and Description" by Ali Youssef and Francisco Vasconcelos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a "diverse multi-view dataset using NeRFs," which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they built a NeRF dataset consisting of images from 10 different indoor and outdoor scenes, totaling 10,000 synthetic images with corresponding depth maps and camera parameters. This section provides the necessary details about the dataset's composition.

In addition, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the dataset is used in any evaluations or comparisons. The authors mention using their NeRF dataset for training and evaluating their models, which confirms its significance in the research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will note that the citation will be based on their paper. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

> Ali Youssef and Francisco Vasconcelos. *NeRF-Supervised Feature Point Detection and Description*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages XX-XX, 2023.

Since the dataset is original and created for this study, I will ensure to include the authors and the title of the paper as the citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the dataset from the research paper.
