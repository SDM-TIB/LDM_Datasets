To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEDIUMVC: ANY-TO-ANY VOICE CONVERSION USING SYNTHETIC SPECIFIC-SPEAKER SPEECHES AS INTERMEDIUM FEATURES" by Yewei Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in voice conversion and mention various methods and datasets. I will pay attention to any specific datasets that are referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments and evaluations. Here, the authors mention several datasets used for training and evaluation, including:

1. **VCTK Corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 44 hours of utterances from 109 speakers. It is used for training the MediumVC model.
2. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is referenced as containing audio from public domain audiobooks, used for evaluation.
3. **LJSpeech**: This dataset is also mentioned, which consists of single-speaker English speech data.
4. **VCC2020**: This dataset is noted for its use in voice conversion challenges, specifically for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details on how these datasets were utilized for evaluation metrics, including naturalness and similarity scores.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **VCTK Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Christophe Veaux, Junichi Yamagishi, Kirsten MacDonald, et al. "Superseded-cstr vctk corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for cstr voice cloning toolkit," 2016.

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. "Librispeech: an asr corpus based on public domain audio books," in 2015 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

- For **LJSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. "The lj speech dataset," 2017.

- For **VCC2020**, the citation is:
  > Yi Zhao, Wen-Chin Huang, Xiaohai Tian, Junichi Yamagishi, Rohan Kumar Das, Tomi Kinnunen, Zhenhua Ling, and Tomoki Toda. "Voice conversion challenge 2020: Intra-lingual semi-parallel and cross-lingual voice conversion," arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.12527, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
