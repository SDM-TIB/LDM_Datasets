To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PETA: Evaluating the Impact of Protein Transfer Learning with Sub-word Tokenization on Downstream Applications" by Yang Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **33 diverse downstream datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section 4 (Benchmark Tasks)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the tasks and datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the PETA benchmark includes **15 distinct tasks** and **33 datasets**. I will carefully extract the names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **subsections under section 4**, the authors describe various tasks such as **Fitness Prediction, Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction, Localization Prediction, Solubility Prediction, and Structure Prediction**. Each task is associated with specific datasets. For example:

1. **GB1 fitness prediction**: This dataset assesses fitness scores among mutations within the GB1 landscape, sourced from Wu et al. (2016).
2. **AAV fitness prediction**: This dataset evaluates fitness values associated with AAV capsid proteins, sourced from Girod et al. (2002).
3. **Yeast PPI prediction**: This dataset predicts interactions between yeast proteins, sourced from Guo et al. (2008).
4. **DeepLoc-1 and DeepLoc-2**: These datasets are used for subcellular localization prediction, sourced from Almagro Armenteros et al. (2017) and Thumuluri et al. (2022), respectively.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, the citations I will extract include:
- For the **GB1 fitness prediction dataset**:
  > Wu, N. C., Dai, L., Olson, C. A., Lloyd-Smith, J. O., & Sun, R. (2016). Adaptation in protein fitness landscapes is facilitated by indirect paths. *Elife*, 5, e16965.

- For the **AAV fitness prediction dataset**:
  > Girod, A., Wobus, C. E., Zádori, Z., Ried, M., Leike, K., Tijssen, P., Klein Schmidt, J. A., & Hallek, M. (2002). The VP1 capsid protein of adeno-associated virus type 2 is carrying a phospholipase A2 domain required for virus infectivity. *Journal of General Virology*, 83, 973–978.

- For the **Yeast PPI prediction dataset**:
  > Guo, Y., Yu, L., Wen, Z., & Li, M. (2008). Using support vector machine combined with auto covariance to predict protein-protein interactions from protein sequences. *Nucleic acids research*, 36, 3025–3030.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation by other researchers.
