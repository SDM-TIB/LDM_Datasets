To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Direct Simultaneous Speech-to-Text Translation Assisted by Synchronized Streaming ASR" by Junkun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **MuST-C dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they conducted experiments on English-to-German (En-to-De) and English-to-Spanish (En-to-Es) translation using the **MuST-C dataset**. This confirms that the dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MuST-C dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MuST-C Dataset**:
  > Mattia A. Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus*. In NAACL, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will only need to create an entry for the MuST-C dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
