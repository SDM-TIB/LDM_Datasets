To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Pose and Shape Estimation for Category-level 3D Object Perception" by Jingnan Shi, Heng Yang, and Luca Carlone, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions an extensive experimental evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI), as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using a simulated dataset and the **PASCAL3D+ dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that at least two datasets are involved.

In the **experiments section**, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: The authors describe conducting an ablation study on a simulated dataset, but they do not provide a formal citation since it is likely generated for the purpose of this research.

2. **PASCAL3D+ Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as being used for evaluation. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

Next, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the **PASCAL3D+ dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Y. Xiang, R. Mottaghi, and S. Savarese. *Beyond PASCAL: A benchmark for 3D object detection in the wild*. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 75–82, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Simulated Dataset**: No formal citation, as it is generated for the study.
- **PASCAL3D+ Dataset**: 
  > Y. Xiang, R. Mottaghi, and S. Savarese. *Beyond PASCAL: A benchmark for 3D object detection in the wild*. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 75–82, 2014.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
