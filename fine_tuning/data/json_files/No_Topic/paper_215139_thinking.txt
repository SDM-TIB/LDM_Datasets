To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MHP-VOS: Multiple Hypotheses Propagation for Video Object Segmentation" by Shuangjie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The introduction may provide more context or specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, specifically **DAVIS2016** and **DAVIS2017**. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the evaluation of the proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **DAVIS2016**: This dataset contains 50 video sequences divided into training and testing parts, with each sequence consisting of a single object and corresponding masks.
2. **DAVIS2017**: An extension of DAVIS2016, this dataset includes 30 challenging videos with multiple objects, occlusions, and background noise.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **DAVIS2016**, the citation is:
  > F. Perazzi, J. Pont-Tuset, B. McWilliams, L. Van Gool, M. Gross, and A. Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 724–732, 2016.

- For **DAVIS2017**, the citation is:
  > J. Pont-Tuset, F. Perazzi, S. Caelles, P. Arbeláez, A. Sorkine-Hornung, and L. Van Gool. *The 2017 davis challenge on video object segmentation*. arXiv:1704.00675, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
