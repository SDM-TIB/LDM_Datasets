To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence-based Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Comparative Study and Analysis" by Christoph Berger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on a computer vision benchmark and a medical imaging task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** sections, particularly in **section 3 (Benchmarking on CIFAR10 vs SVHN)** and **section 4 (Benchmarking on the X-ray Lung Pathology Dataset)**. In section 3, the authors state they use the **CIFAR10** dataset as the in-distribution (ID) dataset and the **SVHN** dataset as the out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset. They provide details about the number of samples used for training and testing.

In section 4, the authors mention using subsets of the **CheXpert** dataset for their experiments, specifying two different settings for ID and OOD classes. They provide the number of samples for each setting, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., Hinton, G. (2011). *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. Retrieved from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., Ng, A.Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 

3. **CheXpert Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., Haghgoo, B., Ball, R., Shpanskaya, K., et al. (2019). *CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 33, pp. 590â€“597.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
