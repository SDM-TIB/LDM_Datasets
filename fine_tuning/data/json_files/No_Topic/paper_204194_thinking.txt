To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Person-Job Fit: Adapting the Right Talent for the Right Job with Joint Representation Learning" by Chen Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a **large-scale real-world dataset**, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They specify that the dataset consists of **historical job application records from a large high-tech company in China**, which includes over two million resumes and 15,039 job postings, along with 31,928 successful job applications. This section is crucial as it provides specific information about the dataset's size and context.

In the same section, the authors also mention that they filtered the dataset to remove intern applications and incomplete records, resulting in a final dataset of **12,007 successful job applications**. This detail is important for understanding the dataset's composition and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is proprietary and specific to the authors' research, so it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from internal records of a company and does not have a standard citation.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Historical Job Application Records
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset containing over two million resumes and 15,039 job postings, with 12,007 successful job applications after filtering. The dataset is used to evaluate the Person-Job Fit Neural Network (PJFNN) model.
   - **Citation**: Not available (proprietary dataset from a high-tech company in China).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation due to the proprietary nature of the dataset.
