To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive-Rate Sparse Signal Reconstruction With Application in Compressive Background Subtraction" by JoÃ£o F. C. Mota et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed algorithm to compressive video background subtraction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to video sequences.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. The authors mention applying their algorithm to two sequences: the **Hall monitor sequence** and the **PETS 2009 sequence**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and any relevant annotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide information about the Hall monitor sequence, which consists of 282 frames with two people walking in an office. They also mention the PETS sequence, which contains 171 frames of people walking on a street. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the sources of these sequences, which is essential for proper citation. 

For the **Hall monitor sequence**, the citation is:
> Hall monitor sequence. Available at: http://trace.eas.asu.edu/yuv/

For the **PETS 2009 sequence**, the citation is:
> PETS 2009 sequence. Available at: http://garrettwarnell.com/ARCS-1.0.zip

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
