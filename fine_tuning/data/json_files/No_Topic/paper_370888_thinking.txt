To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferring Multiple Policies to Hotstart Reinforcement Learning in an Air Compressor Management Problem" by Hélène Plisnier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention generating several variants of the air compressor management problem by altering the size of the tank and the compressors. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setup and the parameters used to create the environment for their reinforcement learning experiments.

Since no external datasets are referenced, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. I will look for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the air compressor management problem or reinforcement learning in general.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that could be associated with datasets or experimental setups used in the paper. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the authors primarily used simulated environments rather than publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I document the full citations for any datasets or relevant papers I find, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets or experimental setups.
3. Check the references for any relevant citations related to datasets.
4. Compile and document full citations for any datasets or relevant papers found.
5. Note if no external datasets were used and that the experiments were based on simulated environments.
