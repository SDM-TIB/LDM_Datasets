To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What if we had no Wikipedia? Domain-independent Term Extraction from a Large News Corpus" by Yonatan Bilu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data Preparation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention the **LexisNexis Corpus (LNC)**, which consists of around 400 million articles, and a sampled subset referred to as **LexisNexis Corpus Sample (LNCS)**, containing 1 million distinct sentences. This indicates that these two datasets are central to the research.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of experiments or evaluations. The authors also refer to the **ACL RD-TEC 2.0 benchmark**, which is used for evaluating term extraction methods. This benchmark consists of 300 abstracts from the ACL anthology, annotated for terms related to NLP.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **LexisNexis Corpus (LNC)**: Since this is a proprietary dataset, it may not have a formal citation like academic datasets. However, I will note it as:
   > LexisNexis. *LexisNexis News Articles Corpus*. Available at: https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/home.page

2. **LexisNexis Corpus Sample (LNCS)**: This is derived from the LNC, so I will reference it similarly:
   > LexisNexis. *LexisNexis News Articles Sample Corpus*. Available at: https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/home.page

3. **ACL RD-TEC 2.0 benchmark**: The citation for this benchmark is:
   > QasemiZadeh, B., & Schumann, A.-K. (2016). *The ACL RD-TEC 2.0: A language resource for evaluating term extraction and entity recognition methods*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1862–1868.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
