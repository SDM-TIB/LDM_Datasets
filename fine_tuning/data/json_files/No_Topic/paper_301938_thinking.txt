To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Neural Collaborative Filtering" by Vasileios Perifanis and Pavlos S. Efraimidis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **four real-world datasets**: MovieLens 100K, MovieLens 1M, Lastfm 2K, and Foursquare NY. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of interactions, items, users, and any relevant statistics such as sparsity.

I will also check the **tables** included in the paper, specifically Table 3 and Table 4, which summarize the characteristics of the datasets. This will help me gather quantitative information about each dataset, such as the number of interactions, items, users, and the sparsity of the data.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned in this paper, the citations are as follows:

1. **MovieLens 100K**:
   > F. M. Harper, J. A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 2015.

2. **MovieLens 1M**:
   > F. M. Harper, J. A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 2015.

3. **Lastfm 2K**:
   > I. Cantador, P. Brusilovsky, T. Kuflik. *Second workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (HetRec2011)*. In Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Recommender systems - RecSys â€™11, ACM Press, 2011.

4. **Foursquare NY**:
   > Dingqi Yang, Daqing Zhang, V. W. Zheng, Zhiyong Yu. *Modeling User Activity Preference by Leveraging User Spatial Temporal Characteristics in LBSNs*. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 45(1), 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
