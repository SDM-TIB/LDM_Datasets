To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADASPEECH 2: Adaptive Text to Speech with Untranscribed Data" by Yuzi Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of AdaSpeech 2 and mentions the use of untranscribed speech data for adaptation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors detail the datasets used for training and adaptation. In this section, they mention:

1. **LibriTTS Dataset**: This dataset is used to train the source TTS model and is described as containing 586 hours of speech data with 2,456 speakers.

2. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset is used for adaptation and contains 44 hours of speech data with 108 speakers.

3. **LJSpeech Dataset**: Another dataset used for adaptation, it is described as a single-speaker high-quality dataset with a total length of 24 hours.

Additionally, the authors mention using an internal spontaneous ASR speech dataset, but since it is not publicly available, I will not include it in the dataset extraction.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **LibriTTS**, the citation is:
  > Heiga Zen, Viet Dang, Rob Clark, Yu Zhang, Ron J Weiss, Ye Jia, Zhifeng Chen, and Yonghui Wu. *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from Librispeech for text-to-speech*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.02882, 2019.

- For **VCTK**, the citation is:
  > Christophe Veaux, Junichi Yamagishi, Kirsten MacDonald, et al. *Superseded-CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit*. 2016.

- For **LJSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito et al. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
