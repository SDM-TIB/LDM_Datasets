To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Few-get-richer: A Surprising Consequence of Popularity-based Rankings" by Fabrizio Germano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and methodology sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the implications of popularity-based rankings but do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they refer to an online experiment, which suggests that there may be data collected from this experiment.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe the online experiment conducted with human participants. They mention that data from the experiment are available at a specific URL (https://osf.io/nwjyf/). This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the experiment, which I need to describe.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the data collected from the experiment, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they analyze the data from the online experiment, which reinforces the idea that the dataset is derived from this experiment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors state that data from the experiment are available at the provided URL, but they do not cite a specific dataset paper. Therefore, I will treat the dataset as part of the supplementary materials associated with this paper.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Fabrizio Germano, Vicenç Gómez, and Gaël Le Mens. 2019. The Few-get-richer: A Surprising Consequence of Popularity-based Rankings. In Proceedings of the 2019 World Wide Web Conference (WWW ’19), May 13–17, 2019, San Francisco, CA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313693

Based on this analysis, I will create an entry for the dataset derived from the online experiment, ensuring to include the citation for the paper as the authoritative source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is clearly presented for reference.
