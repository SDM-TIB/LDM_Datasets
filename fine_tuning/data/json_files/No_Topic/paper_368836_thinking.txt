To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Array Design for Dual-Function Radar-Communications System" by Huiping Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. If the authors describe experiments or simulations, they may reference specific datasets used for validation or comparison.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical simulations or experiments described in **Section IV (Simulation Results)**, as this is often where datasets are discussed in terms of their application in the research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets like "the TxPower dataset" or "MSRR dataset," I will ensure to find their full citations. If the datasets are derived from other works, I will cite the original sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for structured output, ensuring that all entries are clear and accurately reflect the content of the paper.
