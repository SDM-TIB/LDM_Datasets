To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of imperfect vaccine, vaccine trade-off and population turnover on infectious disease dynamics" by Hetsron L. Nyandjo-Bamena et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Data and Methods" or "Materials and Methods."** In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets they used, including their sources, characteristics, and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when presenting their findings or comparing their results with previous studies. This can provide additional context about the datasets used.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used in the study.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Covid-19 Vaccination Dataset," I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> "John Doe, Jane Smith. *Covid-19 Vaccination Dataset*. Available at: [URL], accessed on [date]."

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing clear pathways for others to access the data.
