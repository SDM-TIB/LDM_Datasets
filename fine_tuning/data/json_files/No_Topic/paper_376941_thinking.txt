To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LiDAR Spoofing Meets the New-Gen: Capability Improvements, Broken Assumptions, and New Attack Strategies" by Takami Sato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a large-scale measurement study on LiDAR spoofing attack capabilities against object detectors trained on five different datasets. This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the object detection models and datasets**. In this section, the authors mention that they prepared five different versions of the PointPillars model trained on the following datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset for 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.
2. **Waymo Open Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving, providing diverse scenarios and annotations.
3. **nuScenes Dataset**: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving that includes LiDAR and camera data.
4. **Lyft Dataset**: Another dataset for 3D object detection in urban environments.
5. **Apollo 6.0 Dataset**: A dataset used in the Apollo autonomous driving platform.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **KITTI Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
