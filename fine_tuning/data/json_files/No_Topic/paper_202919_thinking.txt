To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are object detection assessment criteria ready for maritime computer vision?" by Dilip K. Prasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of visible and infrared cameras for object detection in maritime environments, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **Singapore maritime dataset**, which is described as containing 34 high-definition videos taken from Canon 70D cameras. This section provides details about the dataset, including the types of objects labeled (e.g., boat, buoy, ferry, etc.) and the conditions under which the videos were captured.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Singapore maritime dataset. The authors reference a previous work that published this dataset, which is crucial for providing the complete citation.

The citation for the Singapore maritime dataset is:
> D. K. Prasad, D. Rajan, L. Rachmawati, E. Rajabaly, and C. Quek. "Video processing from electro-optical sensors for object detection and tracking in maritime environment: a survey." *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, vol. 18, no. 8, pp. 1993–2016, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Singapore maritime dataset
   - **Description**: Contains 34 high-definition videos taken from Canon 70D cameras, with labeled bounding boxes for various maritime objects.
   - **Full Citation**: D. K. Prasad, D. Rajan, L. Rachmawati, E. Rajabaly, and C. Quek. "Video processing from electro-optical sensors for object detection and tracking in maritime environment: a survey." *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, vol. 18, no. 8, pp. 1993–2016, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for output in the required format.
