To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Forecasting emissions through Kaya identity using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations" by Pierre Browne et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting carbon emissions indicators, which suggests that relevant datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their study. They state that four datasets were utilized: two from the World Bank (population and GDP) and two from the International Energy Agency (total energy supply and CO2 emissions from fuel combustion). This section is crucial as it provides the names and sources of the datasets.

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **World Bank Population Dataset**: This dataset contains population data for various countries, sourced from the World Bank Open Data platform.

2. **World Bank GDP Dataset**: This dataset includes GDP data for countries, also sourced from the World Bank Open Data platform.

3. **IEA Total Energy Supply Dataset**: This dataset provides information on total energy supply, sourced from the International Energy Agency.

4. **IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion Dataset**: This dataset details CO2 emissions resulting from fuel combustion, also sourced from the International Energy Agency.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **World Bank Population Dataset**:
  > World Bank. Population, total — data, 2020b. URL https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL.

- For the **World Bank GDP Dataset**:
  > World Bank. GDP (current US$) — data, 2020a. URL https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD.

- For the **IEA Total Energy Supply Dataset**:
  > IEA. World Energy Balances (database), 2020a. URL https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/world-energy-balances-highlights.

- For the **IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion Dataset**:
  > IEA. CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, 2020b. URL https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-highlights.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
