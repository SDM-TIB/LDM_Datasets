To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PhySU-Net: Long Temporal Context Transformer for rPPG with Self-Supervised Pre-training" by Marko Savic and Guoying Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is tested on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two datasets: **OBF** and **VIPL-HR**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **OBF Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 200 five-minute-long RGB videos recorded from 100 subjects in a controlled environment. This dataset is crucial for their experiments as it provides stable lighting and minimal subject movement.

2. **VIPL-HR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,378 RGB videos, each lasting between 20 to 30 seconds, recorded in a challenging environment with variable lighting and significant subject movement. The authors highlight that this dataset presents many sources of noise, making heart rate estimation particularly challenging.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **OBF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Li, I. Alikhani, J. Shi, T. Seppanen, J. Junttila, K. Majamaa-Voltti, M. Tulppo, and G. Zhao. *The OBF database: A large face video database for remote physiological signal measurement and atrial fibrillation detection*. In 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pages 242–249. IEEE, 2018.

- For the **VIPL-HR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Niu, H. Han, S. Shan, and X. Chen. *VIPL-HR: A multi-modal database for pulse estimation from less-constrained face video*. In Computer Vision–ACCV 2018: 14th Asian Conference on Computer Vision, Perth, Australia, December 2–6, 2018, Revised Selected Papers, Part V 14, pages 562–576. Springer, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
