To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Venturing the Definition of Green Energy Transition: A systematic literature review" by Pedro V. Hern√°ndez Serrano and Amrapali Zaveria, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding energy transition and mention various factors but do not explicitly list datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section**, where they describe their approach to gathering data. Here, they mention using a systematic literature review and highlight the lack of accessible data regarding factors responsible for energy transition.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section** and the **quantitative analysis section**. In these sections, the authors list specific datasets they utilized for their analysis. They mention several datasets with their respective sources:

1. **Renewable energy consumption in % of total final energy consumption**: 
   - Source: World Bank, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), 2019.

2. **Renewable electricity consumption in % of total electricity consumption**: 
   - Source: World Bank, IEA Statistics, 2018.

3. **Research and development budget**: 
   - Source: OECD, IEA, 2017.

4. **Electric power consumption (kWh per capita)**: 
   - Source: World Bank, IEA Statistics, 2014.

5. **GDP per capita (current US$)**: 
   - Source: World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files, 2019.

6. **Median and median income per household type**: 
   - Source: Eurostats, 2019.

7. **Climate change law from the world database**: 
   - Source: Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation as per the requirements. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
