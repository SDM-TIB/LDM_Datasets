To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The DSA Transparency Database: Auditing Self-reported Moderation Actions by Social Media" by Amaury Trujillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper analyzes "353.12M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU," which suggests that the dataset is derived from the DSA Transparency Database.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the analysis. The **Overview of the DSA Transparency Database** section provides insights into the dataset, mentioning that it consists of "all SoRs submitted during the initial 100 days since the establishment of the database." This confirms that the dataset is the DSA Transparency Database itself.

In the **Analyses and Results** section, the authors discuss the dataset's characteristics, including the number of statements of reasons (SoRs) submitted by various platforms. They also mention the platforms analyzed, which include Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube. This information is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DSA Transparency Database. However, since the dataset is a product of the European Union's Digital Services Act and does not have a traditional citation like a journal article, I will note that the dataset can be accessed through the official DSA Transparency Database website.

The citation for the dataset will be as follows:
> DSA Transparency Database. European Commission. Available at: https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. The dataset extracted from this paper is the DSA Transparency Database, which contains extensive records of moderation actions by social media platforms in the EU.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset's existence.
2. Look for specific sections detailing the dataset's characteristics and the platforms involved.
3. Check the references for the dataset citation, noting that it is an official database from the European Commission.

With this information, I will now prepare the dataset entry for the DSA Transparency Database.
