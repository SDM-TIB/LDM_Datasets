To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Unfolding of a Proximal Interior Point Method for Image Restoration" by C. Bertocchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments on image deblurring problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **Section 6 (Numerical experiments)**, where they mention using a training set of 1200 RGB images, which includes 200 images from the Berkeley segmentation (BSD500) training set and 1000 images from the COCO training set. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD500)**:
   > Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 416–423.

2. **COCO Dataset**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & Dollár, P. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset.
