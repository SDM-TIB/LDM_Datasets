To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using digital traces to build prospective and real-time county-level early warning systems to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States" by Lucas M. Stolerman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets or data sources used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or data sources that the authors utilized for their analysis. This section often outlines the background and rationale for the study, which may include data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, which typically details the datasets used in the study. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were collected or processed.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons that might indicate the significance of the datasets used.

Finally, I will review the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets, including their limitations or implications for future research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research and can present them accurately.

After completing this process, I will be ready to format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
