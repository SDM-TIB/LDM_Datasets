To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disturbances in Influence of a Shepherding Agent is More Impactful than Sensorial Noise During Swarm Guidance" by Hung The Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the shepherding model under different noise conditions, which may imply the use of datasets for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that were utilized in their simulations. If the authors refer to any established datasets or provide details about the data they collected, I will note those down.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting simulations based on the Str√∂mbom approach. I will check if they reference any datasets related to this approach or if they describe any custom datasets they created for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include the original papers or sources where those datasets were introduced. If they created their own datasets, I will document the details provided in the paper, including any relevant citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations for each dataset identified.
