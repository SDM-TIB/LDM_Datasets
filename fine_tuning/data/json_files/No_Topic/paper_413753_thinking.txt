To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IR-UWB Radar-Based Contactless Silent Speech Recognition of Vowels, Consonants, Words, and Phrases" by Sunghwa Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves silent speech recognition using various speech stimuli, which suggests that there may be datasets related to vowels, consonants, words, and phrases.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **data acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe the speech stimuli used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the types of speech stimuli: 8 vowels, 11 consonants, 25 words, and 12 phrases. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional information regarding the datasets, such as how they were utilized in the experiments or any performance metrics associated with them. The authors mention that the speech stimuli were pronounced by participants, which confirms the existence of a dataset based on these pronunciations.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references a previous work for the speech stimuli, specifically noting that the comprehensive pronunciation list can be found in reference [9]. I will locate this reference in the **References section** to obtain the full citation.

The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:

1. **Vowel Dataset**: This dataset includes 8 CVC syllables pronounced by participants.
   - Citation: Wang, J., Samal, A., Green, J. R., & Rudzicz, F. (2016). An optimal set of flesh points on tongue and lips for speech-movement classification. *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*, 59(1), 15-26.

2. **Consonant Dataset**: This dataset includes 11 VCV syllables pronounced by participants.
   - Citation: Wang, J., Samal, A., Green, J. R., & Rudzicz, F. (2016). An optimal set of flesh points on tongue and lips for speech-movement classification. *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*, 59(1), 15-26.

3. **Word Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25 phonetically balanced words.
   - Citation: Wang, J., Samal, A., Green, J. R., & Rudzicz, F. (2016). An optimal set of flesh points on tongue and lips for speech-movement classification. *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*, 59(1), 15-26.

4. **Phrase Dataset**: This dataset includes 12 short phrases commonly used in augmentative and alternative communication devices.
   - Citation: Wang, J., Samal, A., Green, J. R., & Rudzicz, F. (2016). An optimal set of flesh points on tongue and lips for speech-movement classification. *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*, 59(1), 15-26.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
