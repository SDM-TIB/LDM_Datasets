To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Engineering Mixed-Integer Linear Programming: Constraint Typology" by Vicky Mak-Hau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the investigation of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of MILP and its applications without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might discuss experiments or case studies. The paper mentions various examples of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and references other works, but it does not provide specific datasets used for these examples. Instead, it discusses methodologies and theoretical frameworks.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the papers referenced. However, the references primarily consist of academic papers that discuss MILP and related optimization problems, rather than datasets themselves.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is more on the theoretical framework and the development of an optimization modeling tree rather than empirical validation using datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not include any datasets for analysis or experimentation.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
