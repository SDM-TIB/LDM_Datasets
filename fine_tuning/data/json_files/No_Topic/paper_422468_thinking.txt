To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Classification with Partial Feedback: An Exploration-Based Data-Collection Approach" by Vijay Keswani, Anay Mehrotra, and L. Elisa Celis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach on real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Empirical Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic and financial data of around 251,000 individuals from California. The task is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. The authors note that they use race and gender as protected attributes.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset includes entries of individuals who have taken credit, and the task is to determine whether the associated credit risk is good or bad. The authors specify that gender is used as the protected attribute in their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Frances Ding, Moritz Hardt, John Miller, and Ludwig Schmidt. *Retiring adult: New datasets for fair machine learning*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34:6478â€“6490, 2021.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hans Hofmann. *German credit dataset, 1994*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed or referenced in future work.
