To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency and Spatial domain based Saliency for Pigmented Skin Lesion Segmentation" by Zanobya N. Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the performance of the proposed method is assessed on the **PH2** and **ISIC 2016** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Results and Discussion** section, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the author provides details about both datasets:

1. **PH2 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 200 images and is used for evaluating the segmentation framework. The ground truths for these images are provided by expert dermatologists.

2. **ISIC 2016 Dataset**: This dataset contains 900 dermoscopy images, also with ground truths available from dermatologists.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PH2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mendonca, T., Ferreira, P. M., Marques, J. S., Marcal, A. R. S., & Rozeira, J. (2013). PH2 - A dermoscopic image database for research and benchmarking. In Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS, 5437â€“5440.

- For the **ISIC 2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISIC (2016). ISIC Archive: The International Skin Imaging Collaboration: Melanoma Project. Available: https://isic-archive.com/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
