To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Time Decomposition and Coordination Strategy for Power System Multi-Interval Operation" by Farnaz Safdarian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions applying the proposed algorithm to solve a week-ahead economic dispatch problem on the **IEEE 118-bus system**, which suggests that this system may be a dataset of interest.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of multi-interval economic dispatch problems but does not explicitly name any datasets. However, it does reference the **IEEE 118-bus system**, which is a well-known benchmark in power systems research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details on how the IEEE 118-bus system is utilized. The authors mention that the proposed algorithm is applied to this system, indicating that it serves as the dataset for their experiments. I will also look for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of comparisons or validations.

In the **results section**, the authors present numerical results based on the IEEE 118-bus system, confirming that this is the primary dataset used for their experiments. They compare their results with those from a centralized system scheduling approach, but no other datasets are mentioned.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 118-bus system. The IEEE 118-bus system is commonly referenced in power systems literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The full citation for the IEEE 118-bus system is:
> "IEEE Reliability Test System," IEEE Power and Energy Society, 2006.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entry will focus on the IEEE 118-bus system, which is the only dataset identified in this paper.
