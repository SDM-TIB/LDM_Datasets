To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Trace-norm Minimization by Subspace Pursuit Proximal Riemannian Gradient," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. This section often discusses the context of the research and may reference datasets that are foundational to the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will focus on the **experiments** section, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in the study. This section typically details the methodologies and datasets employed for evaluation. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the dataset characteristics, such as size, type, and source.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be mentioned based on the context of the research:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: A well-known dataset for collaborative filtering and recommendation systems. I will look for the specific version used and its citation.
2. **Netflix Prize Dataset**: Another popular dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. I will ensure to find the correct citation for the dataset.
3. **Yahoo! Music Dataset**: This dataset is often used in music recommendation research. I will verify its citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately.
