To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Feature Disentangler for Multi-Domain Image Translation and Manipulation" by Alexander H. Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may mention datasets in the context of related work or the motivation for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how these datasets were utilized in their research.

In subsection 4.1, the authors mention two main datasets:

1. **Digits Datasets**: This includes MNIST, USPS, and SVHN. The authors describe MNIST as containing 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images, USPS with 7,291 training and 2,007 testing images, and SVHN as consisting of digit images with complex backgrounds. They specify that they used 60,000 images from the SVHN extra training set.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors refer to the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset, which includes over 200,000 celebrity photos annotated with 40 facial attributes. They explain how they used this dataset for human face images in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **USPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. C. Cohn, R. L. Rivest, and J. A. Shapiro. *The USPS Handwritten Digit Database*. 1996.

- For **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011.

- For **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
