To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refine-Net: Normal Refinement Neural Network for Noisy Point Clouds" by Haoran Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details about their characteristics.

In Section 5.2, the authors mention the **PCPNet dataset**, which consists of 30 shapes from a mixture of figurines, man-made objects, and differentiable surfaces. They specify that 8 shapes are used for training and 22 for testing, with each shape uniformly sampled with 100k points. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, in Section 5.3, they refer to another synthetic dataset from Wang et al. (2016), which contains 21 triangular mesh models with varying sampling densities. This dataset is also significant for their evaluation.

Furthermore, in Section 5.4, the authors mention a real-scanned dataset from Wang et al. (2016) that includes scanned meshes of seven real models using Microsoft Kinect v1. This dataset is used to benchmark their method against real-world data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **PCPNet Dataset**:
   > Guerrero, P., Kleiman, Y., Ovsjanikov, M., & Mitra, N. J. (2018). *PCPNet: Learning local shape properties from raw point clouds*. Computer Graphics Forum, 37(2), 75-85.

2. **Synthetic Dataset from Wang et al. (2016)**:
   > Wang, P.-S., Liu, Y., & Tong, X. (2016). *Mesh denoising via cascaded normal regression*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 35(6), 232-1.

3. **Real-Scanned Dataset from Wang et al. (2016)**:
   > Wang, P.-S., Liu, Y., & Tong, X. (2016). *Mesh denoising via cascaded normal regression*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 35(6), 232-1.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is described clearly, including its purpose and any relevant details, before structuring the final output for review or further processing.
