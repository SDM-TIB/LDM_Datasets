To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-aware Document Summarization: A Survey of Knowledge, Embedding Methods and Architectures" by Yutong Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on knowledge-aware methods in document summarization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of knowledge in document summarization but does not specify any datasets used in the research.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. However, this paper appears to be a survey rather than an empirical study, which typically means it may not include original datasets but rather references existing datasets used in the literature.

In the **references section**, I will check for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the studies reviewed in this survey. I will look for papers that might have introduced or utilized datasets relevant to knowledge-aware document summarization.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings based on the references that discuss datasets in the context of knowledge embedding and document summarization. 

If I find any relevant datasets in the references, I will extract their full citations. For example, if a referenced paper discusses a dataset, I will note the dataset's name and provide the full citation as follows:

- For a hypothetical dataset, the citation might look like:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, pages xx-xx, Year.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets related to knowledge-aware document summarization as discussed in the paper.
