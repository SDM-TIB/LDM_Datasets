To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse-to-Dense Hypercolumn Matching for Long-Term Visual Localization" by Hugo Germain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5**, where the authors discuss their evaluation setup. Here, they mention two datasets used for their experiments: 

1. **RobotCar Seasons Dataset**: This dataset contains images captured by a rear-facing camera mounted on a car in Oxford, with a total of 6,954 daytime reference images and 3,978 query images. The dataset is noted for its challenging conditions, including nighttime images.

2. **Extended CMU-Seasons Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,159 reference images and 75,335 query images, captured in Pittsburgh over different seasonal conditions. The authors mention that this dataset is particularly challenging due to strong vegetation changes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **RobotCar Seasons Dataset**:
  > Maddern, W., Pascoe, G., Linegar, C., & Newman, P. (2017). 1 Year, 1000 Km: the Oxford Robotcar Dataset. *International Journal of Robotics Research*, 36(3), 3-15.

- For the **Extended CMU-Seasons Dataset**:
  > Sattler, T., Maddern, W., Toft, C., Torii, A., Hammarstrand, L., Stenborg, E., Safari, D., Okutomi, M., Pollefeys, M., Sivic, J., Kahl, F., & Pajdla, T. (2018). Benchmarking 6DOF Outdoor Visual Localization in Changing Conditions. In *Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in the required format. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
