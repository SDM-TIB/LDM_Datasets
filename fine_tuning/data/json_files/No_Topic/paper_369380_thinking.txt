To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-training with High-Confidence Pseudo Labels for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Zhiqiang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four public medical image datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Within this section, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **ISIC Dataset**: This dataset is used for skin lesion segmentation and includes 2,594 dermoscopy images. The authors specify that they used 1,815 images for training and 779 for validation.

2. **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for polyp segmentation and contains 1,000 colonoscopy images with corresponding annotations.

3. **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**: Another dataset for polyp segmentation, which includes 612 colonoscopy images with annotations.

4. **3D Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 3D gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images and segmentation masks, with a training split of 80 samples and a validation split of 20 samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ISIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N. C. F., Gutman, D., Celebi, M. E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M. A., Dusza, S. W., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Mishra, N., Kittler, H., et al. (2018).

- For the **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **3D Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
