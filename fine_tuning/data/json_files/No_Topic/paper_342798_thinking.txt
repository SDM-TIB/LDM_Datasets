To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FL Games: A federated learning framework for distribution shifts" by Sharut Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Colored MNIST**: This dataset is a modified version of the original MNIST dataset, designed to introduce spurious correlations through color. The authors describe how the dataset is constructed and its purpose in the context of their experiments.

2. **Colored Fashion MNIST**: Similar to Colored MNIST, this dataset is based on the Fashion MNIST dataset and also incorporates spurious correlations through color. The construction details are provided, which are crucial for understanding its application in the experiments.

3. **Spurious CIFAR10**: This dataset modifies the CIFAR10 dataset by introducing spurious correlations based on the spatial location of features rather than color. The authors explain how this dataset is created and its relevance to their research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Colored MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Martin Arjovsky, Léon Bottou, Ishaan Gulrajani, and David Lopez-Paz. *Invariant risk minimization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.02893, 2019.

- For **Colored Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Kartik Ahuja, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Kush Varshney, and Amit Dhurandhar. *Invariant risk minimization games*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 145–155. PMLR, 2020.

- For **Spurious CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > The CIFAR-10 dataset is described in Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference.
