To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dropping Convexity for More Efficient and Scalable Online Multiview Learning" by Zhehui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract may provide a summary of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. This section should provide explicit names and descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain concise information.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section usually outlines the characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of samples, features, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "MNIST dataset," I would look for its citation, which typically includes:
- Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format, ready for presentation or further processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
