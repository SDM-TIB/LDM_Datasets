To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Towards To-a-T Spatio-Temporal Focus for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Lipeng Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset is described as a large-scale skeleton-based action recognition dataset with over 60 action classes and 40 subjects, captured using Kinect v.2 cameras.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: This dataset extends the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset with 60 additional action classes, totaling 120 action classes for 106 subjects.

3. **Kinetics Skeleton 400**: This dataset is derived from the Kinetics 400 video dataset and is used for skeleton-based action recognition.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.-T., & Wang, G. (2016). NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Liu, J., Shahroudy, A., Perez, M., Wang, G., Duan, L.-Y., & Kot, A. C. (2019). NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

- For **Kinetics Skeleton 400**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., Natsev, P., Suleyman, M., & Zisserman, A. (2017). The kinetics human action video dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
