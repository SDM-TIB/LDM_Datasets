To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multivariate Convex Regression at Scale" by Wenyu Chen and Rahul Mazumder, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset generated based on a specific model, which includes various configurations for different experiments. However, this dataset is not attributed to a specific citation since it is generated by the authors.

2. **Real Data**: The authors mention two real datasets:
   - **RD1**: This dataset has been used in earlier work and is cited as follows:
     > Maethee Mekaroonreung and Andrew L Johnson. *Estimating the shadow prices of so2 and nox for us coal power plants: a convex nonparametric least squares approach*. Energy Economics, 34(3):723â€“732, 2012.
   - **RD2**: This dataset is taken from another source and is cited as:
     > Fred Ramsey and Daniel Schafer. *The statistical sleuth: a course in methods of data analysis*. Cengage Learning, 2012.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the real datasets as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, noting that while the synthetic dataset does not have a citation, the real datasets RD1 and RD2 are well-documented with proper references. This will ensure that the extraction process is thorough and meets the requirements for citation accuracy.
