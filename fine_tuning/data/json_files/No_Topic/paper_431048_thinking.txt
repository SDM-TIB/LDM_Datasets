To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptable Recovery Behaviors in Robotics: A Behavior Trees and Motion Generators (BTMG) Approach for Failure Management" by Faseeh Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed methodology through a series of scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to the peg-in-a-hole task.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe various scenarios for testing their approach, including baseline, static recovery, dynamic recovery, and others. I will pay close attention to any datasets used for these experiments, especially if they are explicitly named or described.

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors may refer to datasets used for training or testing their models. I will note any datasets mentioned in relation to the performance evaluation of their approach.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset related to robotic tasks or specific failure scenarios, I will ensure to find the original source or paper that describes that dataset. If they mention using a simulator like DART, I will also look for any datasets associated with that simulator.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their respective sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
