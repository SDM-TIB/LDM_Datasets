To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting" by Tung Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **WeatherBench 2** and **ERA5 dataset**, which indicates that these are likely the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of numerical weather prediction and the shift towards data-driven approaches, which reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. Here, the authors describe the **ERA5 dataset** in detail, noting that it contains hourly data from 1979 to the present, with various atmospheric variables. They also mention that they used a curated version of this dataset provided by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they trained and evaluated their model on the **ERA5 dataset** and used **WeatherBench 2** as a benchmark for comparison. This section will provide further confirmation of the datasets used and their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ERA5 dataset**:
   > Hans Hersbach et al. "The ERA5 global reanalysis." In: *Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society* 146.730 (2020), pp. 1999â€“2049.

2. **WeatherBench 2**:
   > Stephan Rasp et al. "WeatherBench 2: A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven global weather models." In: *arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.15560* (2023).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
