To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BlendFilter: Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models via Query Generation Blending and Knowledge Filtering" by Haoyu Wang, Tuo Zhao, and Jing Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three open-domain question answering benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three public benchmarks:

1. **HotPotQA**: A dataset designed for multi-hop question answering, which requires reasoning across multiple documents to answer questions.
2. **2WikiMultiHopQA**: Another multi-hop question answering dataset that utilizes information from two Wikipedia articles to answer questions.
3. **StrategyQA**: A dataset focused on commonsense reasoning, where questions require understanding of everyday situations and reasoning.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **HotPotQA**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D Manning. *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369–2380, 2018.

- For **2WikiMultiHopQA**, the citation is:
  > Xanh Ho, Anh-Khoa Duong Nguyen, Saku Sugawara, and Akiko Aizawa. *Constructing a Multi-Hop QA Dataset for Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning Steps*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 6609–6625, 2020.

- For **StrategyQA**, the citation is:
  > Mor Geva, Daniel Khashabi, Elad Segal, Tushar Khot, Dan Roth, and Jonathan Berant. *Did Aristotle Use a Laptop? A Question Answering Benchmark with Implicit Reasoning Strategies*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:346–361, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
