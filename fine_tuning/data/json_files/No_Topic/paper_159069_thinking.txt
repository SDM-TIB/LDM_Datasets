To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Transition-based Algorithm for Unrestricted AMR Parsing" by David Vilares and Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on the **LDC2015E86 corpus**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **Methods and Experiments sections**. In the **Methods section**, the authors state that they use the **LDC2015E86 corpus** for training, development, and testing, specifying the number of graphs in each split: 16,833 for training, 1,368 for development, and 1,371 for testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LDC2015E86 corpus. The citation is typically formatted as follows:

> Linguistic Data Consortium. *LDC2015E86: AMR Annotation for the English Language*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2015.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
