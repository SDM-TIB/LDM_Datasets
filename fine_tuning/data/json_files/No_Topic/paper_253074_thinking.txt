To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small Towers Make Big Differences" by Yuyan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on multi-task learning and hints at empirical results, which may involve datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 5)**, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on three benchmark datasets. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MultiMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is created by extending the MNIST dataset, where two images are combined into one, and the task is to classify the items in both images. The authors reference the original MNIST paper for citation.

2. **MultiFashionMNIST Dataset**: Similar to the MultiMNIST dataset, this dataset is constructed from the FashionMNIST dataset, where two images are combined for classification tasks. The citation for the FashionMNIST dataset is also provided.

3. **MovieLens 1M Dataset**: This dataset is used for a multi-task application involving movie recommendations, where the tasks include predicting whether a user will watch a movie and predicting the user's rating. The authors cite the original MovieLens paper for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE 86, 11 (1998), 2278–2324.

- For **FashionMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

- For **MovieLens 1M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS) 5, 4 (2015), 1–19.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
