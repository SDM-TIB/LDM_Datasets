To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining the Effect of COVID-19 on Foreign Exchange Rate and Stock Market – An Applied Insight into the Variable Effects of Lockdown on Indian Economy" by Indrajit Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **secondary data** over a span of 112 days, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. The authors describe collecting secondary data for the number of infected COVID-19 cases, stock market values, and exchange rates from various sources. This implies that there are at least three datasets involved:

1. **COVID-19 Infected Cases Dataset**: This dataset includes the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India over the specified time period.
2. **Stock Market Dataset (SENSEX)**: This dataset includes the closing values of the SENSEX index during the same period.
3. **Exchange Rate Dataset (GEX)**: This dataset includes the exchange rates of the Indian Rupee against other currencies during the specified time frame.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific details about these datasets, such as their sources or any particular characteristics. However, the paper does not provide detailed citations for these datasets, as they are secondary data collected from various sources.

To ensure proper citation, I will refer to the **references section** to find any relevant studies or data sources that the authors might have cited regarding the datasets. For instance, if they referenced a specific database or publication for the COVID-19 data, I will note that citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **COVID-19 Infected Cases Dataset**: 
   - Citation: "COVID-19 India. COVID-19 Tracker Updates for India for State-wise and District-wise data. 2020. Retrieved May 2020, from COVID19 India: https://www.covid19india.org"

2. **Stock Market Dataset (SENSEX)**: 
   - Citation: "Challa, M. L., Malepati, V., & Kolusu, S. N. R. (2018). Forecasting risk using auto regressive integrated moving average approach: an evidence from S&P BSE Sensex. Financial Innovation, 4(1), 24."

3. **Exchange Rate Dataset (GEX)**: 
   - Citation: "Gopinathan, R., & Durai, S. R. S. (2019). Stock market and macroeconomic variables: New evidence from India. Financial Innovation, 5 (1), 1–17."

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that all dataset citations are accurately represented for clarity and future reference.
