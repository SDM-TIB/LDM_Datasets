To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Riemannian Approach to Blob Detection in Manifold-Valued Images" by Aleksei Shestov and Mikhail Kumskov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors provide experiments for the case of vector-valued images on 2D surfaces, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention applying their blob detection framework to a chemical compounds classification problem, also known as the QSAR problem. They state that the input data elements are modeled as 2-dimensional manifolds with vector-valued functions.

The authors specifically mention using **three datasets**: **bzr, er lit, and cox2** from one source, and **three datasets**: **glik, pirim, and sesq** from the Russian Oncology Science Center. This indicates that there are at least two sources of datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

1. For the datasets **bzr, er lit, and cox2**, the citation is:
   > J. J. Sutherland, L. A. O'Brien, and D. F. Weaver. *Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: a method for developing classification structure-activity relationships*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 43:1906–1915, 2003.

2. For the datasets **glik, pirim, and sesq**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper. However, it is mentioned that these datasets come from the Russian Oncology Science Center. I will note that while the specific citation is not provided, it is important to acknowledge the source as it is relevant to the datasets used.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Dataset 1**: bzr, er lit, cox2
  - Citation: J. J. Sutherland, L. A. O'Brien, and D. F. Weaver. *Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: a method for developing classification structure-activity relationships*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 43:1906–1915, 2003.

- **Dataset 2**: glik, pirim, sesq
  - Citation: Russian Oncology Science Center (specific citation not provided in the paper).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations.
