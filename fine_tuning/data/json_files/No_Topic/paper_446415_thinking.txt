To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing Operatorâ€™s Risk Averseness in Model Predictive Control of a Reservoir System" by Ja-Ho Koo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for the numerical experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets relevant to their research context. They may reference previous studies or datasets that inform their work.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the numerical experiments. This section often contains specific information about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets, especially if the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Daecheong reservoir data," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is publicly available, I will note the URL or repository where it can be accessed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clearly documented and ready for use in future research or applications.
