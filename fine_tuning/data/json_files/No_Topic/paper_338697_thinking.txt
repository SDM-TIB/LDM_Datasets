To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UAMD-Net: A Unified Adaptive Multimodal Neural Network for Dense Depth Completion" by Guancheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a multimodal neural network for depth completion and mentions experiments conducted on the **KITTI depth completion benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the **KITTI depth completion dataset**. They provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of depth maps available for training, validation, and testing, as well as how the ground truth depth maps were generated.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **KITTI depth completion dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354â€“3361. IEEE, 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the KITTI dataset for its experiments, I will ensure that I document this dataset thoroughly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
