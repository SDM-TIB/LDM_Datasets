To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Networks for Traffic Flow Prediction" by Haiyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **four real traffic datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they explicitly mention the datasets in **section IV (Methodology)**, where they state that they evaluated their model on four traffic datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measure System (PeMS): **PEMSD3, PEMSD4, PEMSD7, and PEMSD8**. 

I will then look for a **Datasets subsection** or any relevant tables that provide detailed statistics about these datasets. In this paper, there is a table (Table I) that summarizes the statistics for the four datasets, including the number of nodes, samples, unit of measurement, and time span for each dataset.

Now, I will gather the necessary information for each dataset:

1. **PEMSD3**: 
   - Nodes: 358
   - Samples: 26,208
   - Unit: 5 mins
   - Time Span: 3 months

2. **PEMSD4**: 
   - Nodes: 307
   - Samples: 16,992
   - Unit: 5 mins
   - Time Span: 2 months

3. **PEMSD7**: 
   - Nodes: 883
   - Samples: 28,224
   - Unit: 5 mins
   - Time Span: 4 months

4. **PEMSD8**: 
   - Nodes: 170
   - Samples: 17,856
   - Unit: 5 mins
   - Time Span: 2 months

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the PeMS datasets as follows:

- For **PEMSD3, PEMSD4, PEMSD7, and PEMSD8**, the citation is:
  > Chen, C., Petty, K., Skabardonis, A., Varaiya, P., & Jia, Z. (2001). Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data. *Transportation Research Record*, 1748(1), 96-102.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
