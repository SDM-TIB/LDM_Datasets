To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social Choice Around the Block: On the Computational Social Choice of Blockchain" by Davide Grossi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on blockchain technology and computational social choice, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the theoretical aspects of blockchain and social choice but does not specify any datasets.

I will then proceed to the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodologies or experiments. I will look for any sections that might detail empirical studies or analyses that could involve datasets. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical discussions and does not present any empirical data or datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and technical reports related to blockchain and social choice, with no specific datasets mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets or empirical data, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets, as none are present in the text.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the main sections for any empirical studies or datasets.
3. Checking the references for indirect mentions of datasets.

Ultimately, I found that the paper does not include any datasets, and thus there are no citations to provide.
