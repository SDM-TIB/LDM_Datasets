To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Physiological State Space Model for Clinical Forecasting" by Yuan Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of electronic medical records (EMR) for clinical forecasting, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the importance of EMR data and mention that they are applying their model to real EMR data. This indicates that the dataset is likely related to EMR, but I need to find the specific name.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state that they used the **Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data**. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their study.

I will then look for more details about the MIMIC dataset in the **references section** to provide a full citation. The citation for the MIMIC-III dataset is as follows:
> Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li Wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3, 2016. Article number: 160035.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MIMIC dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MIMIC dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
