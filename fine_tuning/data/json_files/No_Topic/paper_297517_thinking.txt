To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Multi-Adaptive-Resolution-Surfel 6D LiDAR Odometry using Continuous-time Trajectory Optimization" by Jan Quenzel and Sven Behnke, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was evaluated on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experimental results. Here, they mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Urban Loco Dataset**: This dataset was used for mapping and localization in urban scenes, and it includes sequences captured in San Francisco and Hong Kong. The authors reference a paper by Wen et al. (2020) for this dataset.

2. **Newer College Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences recorded with a handheld LiDAR and is referenced from a paper by Ramezani et al. (2020).

3. **DRZ Living Lab Dataset**: This dataset was collected during UAV flights in a controlled environment, and it is mentioned that the authors conducted multiple experiments with varying conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Urban Loco Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wen, W., Zhou, Y., Zhang, G., Fahandezh-Saadi, S., Bai, X., Zhan, W., Tomizuka, M., & Hsu, L. T. (2020). *UrbanLoco: A full sensor suite dataset for mapping and localization in urban scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

- For the **Newer College Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramezani, M., Wang, Y., Camurri, M., Wisth, D., Mattamala, M., & Fallon, M. (2020). *The Newer College dataset: Handheld LiDAR, inertial and vision with ground truth*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

- For the **DRZ Living Lab Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schleich, D., Beul, M., Quenzel, J., & Behnke, S. (2021). *Autonomous flight in unknown GNSS-denied environments for disaster examination*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
