To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symbols as a Lingua Franca for Bridging Human-AI Chasm for Explainable and Advisable AI Systems" by Subbarao Kambhampati et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for symbolic representations in AI systems but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **case studies and research challenges sections**, as these often contain practical examples or references to datasets used in the research.

In **section 4 (Case Studies)**, the authors mention two specific systems: **EXPAND** and **SERLfD**. I will look for any references to datasets used in these systems. 

In the case of **EXPAND**, the authors describe how it utilizes human feedback and visual explanations, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they reference the use of object detectors, which implies that they may be using existing datasets for grounding human object symbols. I will need to check the references for any datasets related to this.

In the **SERLfD** section, the authors mention that the system interprets human demonstrations but again do not specify a dataset. I will check the references section for any datasets that might have been used in the context of these systems.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that may have been referenced indirectly. I will look for papers that might describe datasets related to human-AI interaction, reinforcement learning, or symbolic interfaces.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant datasets:

1. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of grounding human symbols in images. The citation is:
   > Krishna, R.; Zhu, Y.; Groth, O.; Johnson, J.; Hata, K.; Kravitz, J.; Chen, S.; Kalantidis, Y.; Li, L.-J.; Shamma, D. A.; et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1): 32–73, 2017.

2. **Atari-head Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of human eye-tracking and demonstrations, which is relevant for the EXPAND system. The citation is:
   > Zhang, R.; Walshe, C.; Liu, Z.; Guan, L.; Muller, K.; Whritner, J.; Zhang, L.; Hayhoe, M.; and Ballard, D. *Atari-head: Atari human eye-tracking and demonstration dataset*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on Artificial Intelligence, 04, 6811–6820, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
