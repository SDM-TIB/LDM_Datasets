To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Average Convergence Rate of Evolutionary Algorithms II: Continuous Optimization" by Yu Chen and Jun He, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or case studies sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss two case studies involving the **2-D Sphere function** and the **2-D Rastrigin function**. I will check if they reference any datasets or benchmarks related to these functions.

In the **case studies**, the authors describe the optimization problems they are addressing, but they do not explicitly mention external datasets. Instead, they focus on theoretical functions used for optimization. Therefore, I will note that the datasets in this context refer to the mathematical functions themselves rather than external datasets.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets, I will not need to look for references for datasets. However, I will ensure to document the mathematical functions used in the experiments as they are central to the study.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **2-D Sphere Function**: This is a well-known mathematical function used in optimization, defined as:
   \[
   f_S(\mathbf{x}) = x_1^2 + x_2^2
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2\). The optimal solution is \(\mathbf{x}^* = (0, 0)\) with \(f_S(\mathbf{x}^*) = 0\).

2. **2-D Rastrigin Function**: Another widely used benchmark function in optimization, defined as:
   \[
   f_R(\mathbf{x}) = 20 + \sum_{k=1}^{2} (x_k^2 - 10 \cos(2\pi x_k))
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2\). The optimal solution is also \(\mathbf{x}^* = (0, 0)\) with \(f_R(\mathbf{x}^*) = 0\).

Since these functions are standard benchmarks in the field of optimization, I will note that they are widely recognized and do not require specific citations as datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the information about the mathematical functions used in the experiments, noting that they serve as the datasets for the study, even though they are not traditional datasets from external sources.
