To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensor-Based Satellite IoT for Early Wildfire Detection" by How-Hang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of real environmental data for simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation results section** where the authors describe their case study on California wildfires. They mention using "fundamental historical wildfire data" and refer to the **California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) database**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for comparison in their simulations.

I will also check the **tables and figures** in the paper, particularly **Table II**, which presents environmental data of California in 2020. This table lists variables such as wind speed, soil water content, and biomass, which are crucial for their model.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **California Wildfire Data**: This dataset is derived from the CAL FIRE database, which records various wildfire incidents in California, including the incident created time, extinguished time, coordinates, and burned area. This dataset is essential for comparing the simulation results with historical data.

   Full citation for the CAL FIRE dataset:
   > California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. "Incidents Overview", 2021. [Online]. Available: https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/

2. **Environmental Data of California (2020)**: This dataset includes variables such as the 10-meter U-wind component, V-wind component, volumetric soil water, and above-ground live biomass. These variables are crucial for the authors' wildfire model and simulations.

   The source for this environmental data is referenced as:
   > Climate Data Store. "ERA5-Land hourly data from 1981 to present". [Online]. Available: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/10.24381/cds.e2161bac?tab=overview

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations formatted properly. I will then prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
