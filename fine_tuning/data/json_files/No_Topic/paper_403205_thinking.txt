To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM4DV: Using Large Language Models for Hardware Test Stimuli Generation" by Zixi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a benchmarking framework and mentions three self-designed design-under-test (DUT) modules, which may imply the existence of datasets related to these modules.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluations. Here, they mention using three DUT modules: **Primitive Data Prefetcher Core**, **Ibex Instruction Decoder**, and **Ibex CPU**. I will look for any specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these modules.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide results for the three DUT modules but do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they indicate that the DUT modules and their testbenches are self-designed and will be open-sourced upon publication. This suggests that the datasets used for testing are likely generated or constructed by the authors themselves rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any external datasets or their citations, I will note that the datasets are self-designed and do not have formal citations. However, I will still document the DUT modules as datasets in the output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the names of the DUT modules and indicate that they are self-designed datasets. I will also note that there are no formal citations for these datasets since they are not sourced from existing literature.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of the self-designed datasets.
