To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The evolving of Data Science and the Saudi Arabia case. How much have we changed in 13 years?" by Igor Barahona, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset comprising **16,018 abstracts** that feature the term "data science." This indicates that the paper is based on a specific dataset, which I need to describe.

Next, I will look for more details about this dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the author explains that the dataset was collected from the SCOPUS digital library, specifically targeting documents that include "data science" in the title, abstract, or keywords. This gives me the context and the source of the dataset.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the characteristics of the dataset, including the total number of documents and the time span of the data collection (from 2007 to 2022). This information is crucial for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Data Science Abstracts Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 16,018 scientific abstracts that contain the term "data science" in the title, abstract, or keywords, collected from the SCOPUS digital library. The dataset covers a period from 2007 to 2022.
   - **Citation**: Barahona, I., Hernández, D.M., Pérez-Villarreal, H.H. et al. Identifying research topics in marketing science along the past decade: a content analysis. Scientometrics 117, 293–312 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2851-2

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I have the correct citation for the dataset. The citation provided above is from a related work by the same author, which is relevant to the dataset's context.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the dataset's source in future research or applications.
