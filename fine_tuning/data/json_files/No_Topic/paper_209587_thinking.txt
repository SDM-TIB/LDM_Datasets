To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Markerless Monocular Face Capture with 3D Spatial Priors" by Shridhar Ravikumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of prior animation data obtained from accurate 3D tracking systems, which suggests that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to identify any specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the author mentions leveraging "existing data from legacy systems," which indicates that there might be datasets that are either publicly available or previously published.

In **section 9 (3D Spatial Constraints)**, the author describes using prior data in the form of 3D marker locations captured from previous sequences using the Vicon Cara 3D head-mounted device. This section specifies that the data spans multiple sequences of speech and facial expressions from five different people. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. The paper references the Vicon system, which is a well-known motion capture system, but does not provide a specific dataset citation. 

To summarize the findings:
1. **Vicon Cara 3D head-mounted device**: The paper mentions using data from this device, but it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation. The data includes multiple sequences of facial expressions from five different individuals.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that while the Vicon system is referenced, it is not a standalone dataset that can be cited. Instead, it is a tool used to collect data.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant details about the datasets, even if they are not formally cited in the paper. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
