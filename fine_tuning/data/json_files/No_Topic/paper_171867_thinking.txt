To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction beyond the Sentence Boundary" by Chris Quirk and Hoifung Poon, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it mentions the use of a knowledge base for distant supervision, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD) as a source for distant supervision, indicating that this is a dataset relevant to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD). They explain that it contains information about drug-gene interactions, including gene names, drug names, and their relationships. This section confirms that GDKD is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Gene Drug Knowledge Database. The citation is as follows:
> Rodrigo Dienstmann, In Sock Jang, Brian Bot, Stephen Friend, and Justin Guinney. *Database of genomic biomarkers for cancer drugs and clinical targetability in solid tumors*. Cancer Discovery, 5:118â€“123, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to confirm the dataset's details.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create a structured entry for the Gene Drug Knowledge Database (GDKD) that includes its name, description, and citation.
