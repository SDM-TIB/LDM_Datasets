To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyObscure: Hybrid Obscuring for Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing" by Xiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss various datasets used for privacy-preserving data publishing. They specifically mention the **Mimic database**, **MovieLens**, and **Foursquare** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are likely to be used in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset contains 943 users with their demographic information and ratings on 1,682 movies. Each user has rated at least 20 movies, totaling over 100,000 ratings. The authors use movie ratings as privacy-insensitive data and age as private data.

2. **Foursquare Dataset**: This dataset consists of check-in data from 3,669 users with 893,722 check-ins at 1,861 points of interest (POIs) in New York City. The authors generalize users' home addresses and use daily check-in activities as privacy-insensitive data.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MovieLens dataset**:
  > GroupLens. "Movielens 1m and 100k dataset." Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/, 2003.

- For the **Foursquare dataset**:
  > Chicago Data Portal. "Chicago taxi data released." Available at: https://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-data-released/, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
