To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Contexts and Constraints for Improved Geotagging of Human Trafficking Webpages" by Rahul Kapoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a geotag extraction framework and references empirical investigations, which suggests that datasets may be involved. The introduction discusses the challenges of extracting geolocation information from human trafficking webpages, hinting at the use of specific datasets for training and testing.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention that they used a sample of 75 webpages for training and 20 webpages for testing, which are manually annotated with geotags. This indicates that these webpages constitute the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then gather the details about these datasets:
1. **Training Dataset**: A sample of 75 webpages with manually annotated geotags.
2. **Test Dataset**: A sample of 20 webpages, also manually annotated with canonical geotags.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. In this case, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from the DARPA MEMEX program. However, I will note that the authors mention the source of the datasets in the experiments section.

The citation for the paper itself, which provides context for the datasets, is:
> Rahul Kapoor, Mayank Kejriwal, and Pedro Szekely. 2017. Using Contexts and Constraints for Improved Geotagging of Human Trafficking Webpages. In Proceedings of GeoRichâ€™17, Chicago, IL, USA, May 14, 2017, 6 pages. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3080546.3080547

Since the datasets are not formally published or cited in a separate manner, I will note that they are part of the research conducted under the DARPA MEMEX program, but I will not have a formal citation for them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the context and details about the datasets used in the experiments, along with the citation for the paper itself. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the research.
