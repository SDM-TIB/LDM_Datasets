To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of Affective Generation Models" by Guangtao Nie and Yibing Zhan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on affective generation models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then proceed to the introduction, where I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the studies reviewed.

Next, I will examine the **sections discussing related works** and **affective generation models**. These sections may contain references to datasets used in previous studies or models. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their names and the context in which they were used.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named, along with their descriptions. If the authors provide any details about the datasets, such as their size, type, or the specific studies they were used in, I will document that information as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper discusses datasets that are not directly cited but are well-known in the field, I will still provide the standard citations for those datasets based on existing literature.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining academic rigor and clarity in the documentation process.
