To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeRFTAP: Enhancing Transferability of Adversarial Patches on Face Recognition using Neural Radiance Fields" by Xiaoliang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous works, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the test set of face images for the targeted victim is collected from YouTube, comprising 8 diverse scenes with 20 face images each, totaling 160 images. They also mention using 10 source face images from the FFHQ dataset, leading to 1600 attack-target pairs for evaluation.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The FFHQ dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation can be found in the references. The citation for the FFHQ dataset is:

- For **FFHQ Dataset**:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aittala, M. (2019). *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4401-4410.

The YouTube dataset mentioned is likely not formally cited in the references, as it is a collection of publicly available videos. However, I can note that it is a dataset collected from YouTube for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the FFHQ dataset and a note about the YouTube dataset, into a structured format for further processing or review.
