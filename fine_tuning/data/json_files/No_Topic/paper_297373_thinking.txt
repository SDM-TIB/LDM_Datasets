To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Extended Feedback Codes" by Anahid Robert Safavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets they used in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." If such a section exists, I will read it carefully to identify the names and descriptions of the datasets.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will scan through the **methodology** and **results** sections. Authors often describe the datasets in the context of their experiments, detailing how they were used to validate their methods. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is well-known, I may also cross-reference it with existing literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or details in the extraction process.
