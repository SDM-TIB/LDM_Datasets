To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plot-guided Adversarial Example Construction for Evaluating Open-domain Story Generation" by Sarik Ghazarian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the need for high-quality training data for classifiers, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **ROCStories**: This dataset is described as a resource of five-sentence commonsense stories collected via crowd-sourcing, covering logically linked daily events. The authors reference the work by Mostafazadeh et al. (2016) for the dataset's details.

2. **Writing Prompt (WP)**: This dataset contains abstract high-level prompts and their corresponding long human-written stories from an online forum. The authors cite Fan et al. (2018) for the methodology used to extract plots from this dataset.

In addition to these datasets, the authors also describe several manipulated datasets created for their experiments:

- **HEUR_SENT_SUB**: A dataset created by replacing sentences in plausible texts with random sentences.
- **HEUR_KEY_SUB**: A dataset created by substituting keywords in plausible texts with their antonyms.
- **UNION_DATA**: A dataset constructed using a combination of heuristic manipulations.
- **MANPLTS**: A dataset generated using plot-level manipulations.
- **AF_MANPLTS**: A dataset created using adversarial filtering on the manipulated plots.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **ROCStories**, the citation is:
  > Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. (2016). *A corpus and cloze evaluation framework for deeper understanding of commonsense stories*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT 2016), San Diego, CA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Writing Prompt**, the citation is:
  > Fan, A., Lewis, M., & Dauphin, Y. (2018). *Hierarchical neural story generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04833.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, including the manipulated datasets, and ensure that each entry includes the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
