To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black Big Boxes: Do Language Models Hide a Theory of Adjective Order?" by Jaap Jumelet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or corpora that are used in the research. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or corpora that the authors may have utilized to support their claims or experiments. This section often outlines the background and context of the research, which may include dataset descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **"CAP: Corpus of Adjective Pairs"**. Here, the authors describe the creation of a reusable corpus of adjective pairs (CAP) that they developed for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this corpus, including its size, the method of extraction, and any relevant statistics.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets or corpora that were used in their analysis or evaluation of language models. This section often contains specific details about the datasets employed in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **CAP: Corpus of Adjective Pairs**: This is the primary dataset created by the authors for their study. It consists of double adjective phrases extracted from a larger corpus (BabyLM 10M) and is used to evaluate adjective order preferences in language models.

2. **The Pile**: This is a large-scale dataset used for training the Pythia models mentioned in the paper. It serves as the foundational corpus from which the authors draw their data for analysis.

   Citation:

Once I have gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper references for future use.
