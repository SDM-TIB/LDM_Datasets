To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIP-Mixer: Intra-Inter Patch Mixing Architecture for Battery Remaining Useful Life Prediction" by Guangzai Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries, which suggests that datasets related to battery performance may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention using the **NASA PCoE battery dataset**, which is explicitly stated to contain charge-discharge records of different lithium-ion batteries in multiple settings. This is a clear indication that I have identified a dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the NASA PCoE battery dataset. The citation is not directly provided in the text, so I will need to reference the original source of the dataset, which is typically available through the NASA Ames Research Center website.

The citation for the NASA PCoE battery dataset is:
> NASA Ames Research Center. *NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) Battery Dataset*. Available at: https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
