To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CTC-synchronous Training for Monotonic Attention Model" by Hirofumi Inaguma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on the **TEDLIUM release-2** and **Librispeech** corpora, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the **experiments section**. The authors specifically state that they evaluated their method on the **TEDLIUM release-2** and **Librispeech** corpora, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset. The paper mentions:

1. **TEDLIUM release-2**: This dataset consists of 210 hours of lecture recordings, which are used for automatic speech recognition tasks.
2. **Librispeech**: This dataset contains 960 hours of reading audio, also used for speech recognition.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TEDLIUM release-2**, the citation is:
  > A. Rousseau, P. Delégilse, and Y. Estève. *TED-LIUM: An automatic speech recognition dedicated corpus*. In Proceedings of LREC, 2012, pp. 125–129.

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
