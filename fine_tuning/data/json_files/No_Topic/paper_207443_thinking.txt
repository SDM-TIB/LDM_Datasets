To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Semantic Segmentation via Video Propagation and Label Relaxation" by Yi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are likely referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on three datasets: **Cityscapes**, **CamVid**, and **KITTI**. I will note these datasets and look for detailed descriptions or references to them in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific performance metrics for each dataset, confirming their use in the study. I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets.

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The authors mention that they achieved an mIoU of 83.5% on this dataset. The citation for the Cityscapes dataset is:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **CamVid Dataset**: The authors report an mIoU of 82.9% on CamVid. The citation for the CamVid dataset is:
   > Brostow, G. J., Shotton, J., Fauqueur, J., & Cipolla, R. (2008). Segmentation and Recognition Using Structure from Motion Point Clouds. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

3. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors achieved an mIoU of 72.8% on the KITTI dataset. The citation for the KITTI dataset is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., & Urtasun, R. (2012). Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
