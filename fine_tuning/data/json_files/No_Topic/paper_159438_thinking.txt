To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DenseImage Network: Video Spatial-Temporal Evolution Encoding and Understanding" by Xiaokai Chen and Ke Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **Something-Something Dataset**: This dataset is described as being collected for generic human-object interaction, comprising 174 categories and a total of 108,499 videos, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Jester Dataset**: This dataset is for gesture recognition, consisting of 27 categories and a total of 148,092 videos, also with specified splits for training, validation, and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are:

- For the **Something-Something Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo FrÃ¼nd, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, Florian Hoppe, Christian Thurau, Ingo Bax, and Roland Memisevic. *The "something something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For the **Jester Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Twentybn. *A hand gesture dataset*. 2017. Available at: https://www.twentybn.com/datasets/jester.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
