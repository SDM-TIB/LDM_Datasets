To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Estimate External Forces of Human Motion in Video" by Nathan Louis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **ForcePose** and **LAAS Parkour**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (Section 3) of the paper, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **ForcePose Dataset**: This dataset consists of eight subjects performing five movements across multiple trials, resulting in over 1,300 videos with paired force plate data. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly available at a specific GitHub repository.

2. **LAAS Parkour Dataset**: This dataset is described as a publicly available dataset of five subjects performing four parkour movements. The authors provide details about the number of videos and the setup used for data collection.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For the **ForcePose Dataset**, the citation is:
> Nathan Louis, Jason J. Corso, Tylan N. Templin, Travis D. Eliason, and Daniel P. Nicolella. *ForcePose: A Novel Dataset for Ground Reaction Force Prediction from Video*. In Proceedings of ACM Multimedia 2022 (ACMMM â€™22). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2022. https://github.com/MichiganCOG/ForcePose.

For the **LAAS Parkour Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zongmian Li, Jiri Sedlar, Justin Carpentier, Ivan Laptev, Nicolas Mansard, and Josef Sivic. *Estimating 3D Motion and Forces of Person-Object Interactions from Monocular Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and ready for any further processing or review.
