To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tight Continuous Relaxation of the Balanced k-Cut Problem" by Syama Sundar Rangapuram, Pramod Kaushik Mudrakarta, and Matthias Hein, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**. They specifically reference datasets from the UCI repository, which are commonly used in clustering tasks. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Iris Dataset**: A well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers, classified into three species based on four features.
2. **Wine Dataset**: This dataset consists of 178 samples of wine, classified into three classes based on 13 chemical properties.
3. **Vertebral Dataset**: Contains 310 samples related to vertebral column data, classified into three classes.
4. **Ecoli Dataset**: A dataset with 336 samples of E. coli, classified into six classes based on protein localization sites.
5. **4moons Dataset**: A synthetic dataset with 4000 samples, designed to test clustering algorithms.
6. **WebKB4 Dataset**: Contains 4196 samples from web pages, classified into four categories.
7. **Optdigits Dataset**: A dataset with 5620 samples of handwritten digits, classified into ten classes.
8. **USPS Dataset**: Contains 9298 samples of handwritten digits, classified into ten classes.
9. **Pendigits Dataset**: A dataset with 10992 samples of handwritten digits, classified into ten classes.
10. **20news Dataset**: Contains 19928 samples of news articles, classified into twenty categories.
11. **MNIST Dataset**: A widely used dataset with 70000 samples of handwritten digits, classified into ten classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the original papers or repositories where the datasets are hosted. For example, the Iris dataset is often cited as:

  > Fisher, R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems." Annals of Eugenics, 7(2): 179-188, 1936.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
