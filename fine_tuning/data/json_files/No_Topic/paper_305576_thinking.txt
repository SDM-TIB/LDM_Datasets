To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Recovery of Issue-Commit Links: Leveraging Both Textual and Non-textual Data" by Pooya Rostami Mazrae et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a dataset of 12 projects, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data selection and data crawling subsections**, where the authors describe the dataset they used. They mention utilizing a dataset from Claes et al. [7], which is referred to as the **20MAD dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it contains information about issues and commits from various projects.

In the **data selection subsection**, the authors specify that they selected 12 projects based on certain criteria, which further emphasizes the importance of the dataset in their research. They also provide a table (Table I) that summarizes the information about the selected projects, including the number of issues, commits, and links.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **20MAD dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> M. Claes and M. V. M¨antyl¨a. *20-mad: 20 years of issues and commits of mozilla and apache development*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, 2020, pp. 503–507.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference other datasets and methods throughout the paper, such as FRLink and DeepLink, but the primary dataset they focus on for their experiments is the **20MAD dataset**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
