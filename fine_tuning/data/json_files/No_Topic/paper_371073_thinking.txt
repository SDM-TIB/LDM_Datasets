To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Violation-Aware Contextual Bayesian Optimization for Controller Performance Optimization with Unmodeled Constraints" by Wenjie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to optimize closed-loop control systems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Case Study: Constrained VCS Optimization)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using a high-fidelity model of a vapor compression system (VCS) for data collection and optimization. However, they do not specify a dataset name but rather describe the context variables (ambient temperature and humidity) and the system's operational data.

I will also check the **implementation details** section to see if any datasets are referenced. The authors mention using a model written in Modelica and collecting data from simulations, but again, no specific dataset is named.

In the **references section**, I will look for any cited works that may have datasets associated with them. The authors reference various studies related to Bayesian optimization and control systems, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to publicly available datasets.

After reviewing the paper thoroughly, it appears that the authors do not provide specific dataset names or citations for datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they rely on a high-fidelity simulation model and contextual data from real-world conditions.

Since no explicit datasets are mentioned, I will note that the paper primarily discusses a methodology and its application rather than providing specific datasets. If I were to summarize the findings, I would mention the use of simulated data from a VCS model and contextual variables as the basis for their experiments.

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

- **No specific datasets were identified in the paper.**
- The authors utilized a high-fidelity simulation model for data collection and optimization.
- Contextual variables (ambient temperature and humidity) were used in the experiments.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. Instead, I will summarize the methodology and the context in which the research was conducted.
