To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Voice Mimicry Forensics" by Sahar Al Ajmi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a classifier trained on a large dataset of audios, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention that they collected audio data from various sources, specifically noting two parts of their dataset:

1. **All English Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio samples that are either real or mimicked, specifically designed for their experiments. The authors state that they extracted 933 English-only audio samples.

2. **Mixed Dataset**: This dataset includes both English and Arabic audios, totaling 1127 samples. The authors explain that this dataset was created to test the model's performance across different languages.

The authors also mention that the raw dataset is publicly available on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/SaSs7/Dataset. This is crucial information for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following datasets:

- **VoxCeleb Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of containing original voices of celebrities. The citation is:
  > Arsha Nagrani, Joon Son Chung, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman. *Voxceleb: Large-scale speaker verification in the wild*. Computer Speech & Language, 60:101027, 2020.

- **Multilingual Voice Impersonation Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a related dataset for voice impersonation. The citation is:
  > Hareesh Mandalapu, Raghavendra Ramachandra, and Christoph Busch. *Multilingual voice impersonation dataset and evaluation*. In Sule Yildirim Yayilgan, Imran Sarwar Bajwa, and Filippo Sanfilippo, editors, Intelligent Technologies and Applications, pages 179â€“188, Cham, 2021. Springer International Publishing.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.
