To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Unconditional Audio Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks and Cycle Regularization" by Jen-Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of various audio generation tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **LJ Speech Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from books. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset.

2. **MAESTRO Dataset**: This dataset consists of 23 hours of virtuosic piano performances of classical music recorded over several years. The authors specify that they use the audio recordings from the year 2004.

3. **In-house Violin Dataset**: This dataset comprises around 16.7 hours of high-fidelity violin solo recordings of classical music from various composers and violinists. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is important to note its description.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets that have been published in other works. For the datasets mentioned, I will extract the following citations:

- For the **LJ Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ito, K. (2017). *The LJ speech dataset*. Retrieved from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

- For the **MAESTRO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hawthorne, C., Stasyuk, A., Roberts, A., Simon, I., Huang, C. A., Dieleman, S., Elsen, E., Engel, J., & Eck, D. (2019). *Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations.

The in-house violin dataset does not have a formal citation since it is a proprietary collection, but I will note its description.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
