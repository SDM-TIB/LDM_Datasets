To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STL-Based Synthesis of Feedback Controllers Using Reinforcement Learning" by Nikhil Kumar Singh and Indranil Saha, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "several complex continuous control benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the benchmarks used for evaluation. In this section, they list six continuous control benchmarks: **HalfCheetah, Hopper, Ant, Walker, Swimmer, and Humanoid**. Each of these benchmarks is likely associated with specific datasets or environments used for training and testing the reinforcement learning models.

I will then look for any specific details about these benchmarks in the **experimental setup** section. The authors provide a table (Table 2) that outlines the number of observations and actions for each benchmark, which indicates the complexity and structure of the datasets used.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, since these benchmarks are commonly used in the reinforcement learning community, they may not have formal citations in the paper. Instead, I will reference the original sources or documentation for each benchmark:

1. **HalfCheetah**:

2. **Hopper**: 
   - Citation: Erez, T., Tassa, Y., & Todorov, E. (2011). Inﬁnite-Horizon Model Predictive Control for Periodic Tasks with Contacts. In Robotics: Science and Systems.

3. **Ant**: 
   - Citation: Schulman, J., Moritz, P., Levine, S., Jordan, M., & Abbeel, P. (2016). High-Dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation. In ICLR.

4. **Walker**: 
   - Citation: Erez, T., Tassa, Y., & Todorov, E. (2011). Inﬁnite-Horizon Model Predictive Control for Periodic Tasks with Contacts. In Robotics: Science and Systems.

5. **Swimmer**: 
   - Citation: Coulom, R. (2002). Reinforcement Learning Using Neural Networks, with Applications to Motor Control. Ph.D. thesis, Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble.

6. **Humanoid**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
