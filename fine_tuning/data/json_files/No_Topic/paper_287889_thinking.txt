To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hard-label Manifolds: Unexpected Advantages of Query Efficiency for Finding On-manifold Adversarial Examples" by Washington Garcia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of "real-world datasets" and "numerical experiments," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experimental analysis. They describe how they selected samples from the test set of CIFAR-10 for their experiments, which indicates that this dataset is central to their work.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional datasets or details about the datasets used. The appendix mentions experiments on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is another significant dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3), 211-252. doi:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
