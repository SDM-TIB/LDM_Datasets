To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rendu basé image avec contraintes sur les gradients" by Grégoire Nieto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing the method on "several structured and unstructured multi-view datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Extended Abstract** and **Introduction** sections. Here, the authors discuss their method and mention that they demonstrate it on "several structured (HCI Light Field Benchmark Datasets and Stanford Light Field Archive) and unstructured (Strecha et al., 2008) multi-view datasets." This gives me the names of specific datasets to look for.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **HCI Light Field Benchmark Datasets**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their rendering method. It consists of a collection of images captured from various viewpoints.

2. **Stanford Light Field Archive**: Another structured dataset used for testing, which contains light field images that allow for depth estimation and view synthesis.

3. **Strecha et al. (2008)**: This refers to a dataset used for unstructured multi-view experiments, which is likely a collection of images from various sources.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HCI Light Field Benchmark Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Wanner, S., & Goldluecke, B. (2013). Datasets and benchmarks for densely sampled 4D light fields. In Vision, Modelling and Visualization (VMV).

- For the **Stanford Light Field Archive**, the citation is:
  > Stanford University. Stanford Light Field Archive. Retrieved from http://lightfield.stanford.edu/

- For the **Strecha et al. (2008)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Strecha, C., Hansen, W. von, Van Gool, L., Fua, P., & Thoennessen, U. (2008). On benchmarking camera calibration and multi-view stereo for high resolution imagery. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1-8.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
