To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IAI MovieBot: A Conversational Movie Recommender System" by Javeria Habib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of an open-source conversational recommender system for movies, which suggests that there may be datasets related to movies involved in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **implementation section**. In this paper, the authors describe their item collection, which is based on the **MovieLens 25M Dataset**. This dataset is crucial as it forms the foundation of the movie recommendations made by the IAI MovieBot.

In the **implementation section (3.1)**, the authors provide details about the MovieLens 25M Dataset, stating that it contains 62,000 movies with 25 million ratings and 1 million tags assigned by 163,000 users. This dataset is essential for the system's functionality.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MovieLens 25M Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 5(4):19, 2015. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MovieLens 25M Dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
