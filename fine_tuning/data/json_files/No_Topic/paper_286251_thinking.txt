To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit Regularization in Tensor Factorization" by Noam Razin, Asaf Maman, and Nadav Cohen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets they utilized for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, dimensions, or types of data).

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST**, which are commonly used in machine learning research. The authors may describe how these datasets were used in their experiments, including any preprocessing steps or modifications made to the data.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

Similarly, for **Fashion-MNIST**, I would find:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a clear and organized manner.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
