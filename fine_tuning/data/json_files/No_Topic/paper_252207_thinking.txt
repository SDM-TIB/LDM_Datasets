To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Hierarchical Decomposition of Large Deep Networks" by Sumanth Chennupati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their proposed methods. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. The authors mention several datasets in this section, specifically:

1. **CalTech-101 Dataset**: This dataset contains 102 classes with varying numbers of images per class (40 to 800 images) and an image size of 300 × 200 pixels.

2. **CalTech-256 Dataset**: This dataset has 257 classes, with 80 to 827 images per class, also with an image size of 300 × 200 pixels.

3. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 classes, with 500 training images and 100 testing images per class, and an image size of 32 × 32 pixels.

4. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset includes 1000 classes with 1350 samples per class, and images are resampled to 224 × 224 pixels.

5. **ImageNet100 and ImageNet200**: These are subsets of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100 and 200 classes, respectively.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CalTech-101 Dataset**:

- For **CalTech-256 Dataset**:
  > G. Griffin, A. Holub, and P. Perona. *Caltech-256 Object Category Dataset*. Technical Report, California Institute of Technology, 2007.

- For **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **ImageNet100 and ImageNet200**:
  > O. Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
