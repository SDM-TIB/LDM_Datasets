To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Level Additive Modeling for Structured Non-IID Federated Learning" by Shutong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors explicitly describe the datasets they used in a separate section, often titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any mention of datasets in the **experiments section** as well. The authors often describe the datasets used for training and testing their models, including any specific configurations or splits applied to the data.

Once I identify the datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided by the authors, such as the number of samples, classes, or any specific characteristics that distinguish them.

After gathering the necessary information, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Tiny ImageNet** dataset, I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Ya Le and Xuan S. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2015.

Similarly, if they mention the **CIFAR-100** dataset, I will find its citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
