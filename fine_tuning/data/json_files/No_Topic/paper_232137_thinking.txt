To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drug-Target Indication Prediction by Integrating End-to-End Learning and Fingerprints" by Brighter Agyemang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **clinically relevant benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list three datasets: **Davis**, **Metz**, and **KIBA**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the number of compounds, targets, and total pair samples, as these details are crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

In the **table I** of the paper, the authors summarize the datasets, which provides a clear overview of their characteristics. I will extract the following information for each dataset:

1. **Davis Dataset**: 
   - Number of compounds/drugs: 72
   - Number of targets: 442
   - Total number of pair samples: 31,824
   - Filter threshold used: 6

2. **Metz Dataset**: 
   - Number of compounds/drugs: 1,423
   - Number of targets: 170
   - Total number of pair samples: 35,259
   - Filter threshold used: 1

3. **KIBA Dataset**: 
   - Number of compounds/drugs: 3,807
   - Number of targets: 408
   - Total number of pair samples: 160,296
   - Filter threshold used: 6

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **Davis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. I. Davis, J. P. Hunt, S. Herrgard, P. Ciceri, L. M. Wodicka, G. Pallares, M. Hocker, D. K. Treiber, and P. P. Zarrinkar. "Comprehensive analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity." *Nature Biotechnology*, 2011.

- For the **Metz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. T. Metz, E. F. Johnson, N. B. Soni, P. J. Merta, L. Kifle, and P. J. Hajduk. "Navigating the kinome." *Nature Chemical Biology*, 2011.

- For the **KIBA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Tang, A. Szwajda, S. Shakyawar, T. Xu, P. Hintsanen, K. Wennerberg, and T. Aittokallio. "Making sense of large-scale kinase inhibitor bioactivity data sets: A comparative and integrative analysis." *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 2014.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
