To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence Functions for Machine Learning: Nonparametric Estimators for Entropies, Divergences and Mutual Informations" by Kirthevasan Kandasamy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. If there is a section specifically labeled "Datasets," I will focus on that to gather detailed information.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. For example, if there is a table listing the properties of the datasets used for experiments, I will extract the relevant details from there.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics such as the number of samples, features, or any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After gathering the necessary information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the authoritative source for the datasets, which is important for reproducibility and further research.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Penn Action Dataset** and provides a description, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Similarly, I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
