To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Safe Real-time Heuristic Search" by Bence Cserna, Kevin C. Gall, and Wheeler Ruml, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or benchmarks**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Benchmarking." This section will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of benchmark domains, as the authors indicate that they present a new set of benchmarks designed for real-time planning. I will look for specific names of datasets or domains, such as "Airspace," which is introduced as a new benchmark domain.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Airspace" domain, I will ensure to note its description and any relevant details provided in the text. I will then find the citation for the original work that introduced this domain or any related datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
