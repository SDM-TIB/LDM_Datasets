To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlexCap: Generating Rich, Localized, and Flexible Captions in Images" by Debidatta Dwibedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of large-scale training datasets of image region descriptions, which indicates that datasets are a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Localized Captions Dataset)**, where the authors describe how they generated their datasets. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **WebLI Dataset**: The authors state that they created approximately 32 billion image-box-caption triplets from this dataset. This dataset is crucial for training their model, as it provides a large volume of diverse image-text pairs.

2. **YFCC100M Dataset**: The authors mention that they used a subset of 14 million images from this dataset to create around 0.2 billion image-box-caption triplets. This dataset serves as a reproducible benchmark for their experiments.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WebLI**, the citation is:
  > Minderer, M., Gritsenko, A., Houlsby, N. "Scaling open-vocabulary object detection." arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.09683 (2023).

- For **YFCC100M**, the citation is:
  > Thomee, B., Shamma, D.A., Friedland, G., Elizalde, B., Ni, K., Poland, D., Borth, D., Li, L.J. "YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research." Commun. ACM 59(2), 64–73 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1145/2812802.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **WebLI Dataset** - 32 billion image-box-caption triplets.
   - Citation: Minderer, M., Gritsenko, A., Houlsby, N. "Scaling open-vocabulary object detection." arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.09683 (2023).
   
2. **YFCC100M Dataset** - 0.2 billion image-box-caption triplets.
   - Citation: Thomee, B., Shamma, D.A., Friedland, G., Elizalde, B., Ni, K., Poland, D., Borth, D., Li, L.J. "YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research." Commun. ACM 59(2), 64–73 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1145/2812802.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further tasks or analyses related to these datasets.
