To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PreSight: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception with City-Scale NeRF Priors" by Tianyuan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their framework on the **nuScenes dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they provide details about the nuScenes dataset, describing how they split it into training, prior, and testing segments. This section is crucial as it outlines the specific scenes used for each purpose, which is essential for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

The authors mention that the nuScenes dataset consists of scenes from various locations, specifically Boston Seaport and Singapore Queenstown for training, and Singapore Onenorth and Singapore Holland Village for prior and testing. They also provide a detailed list of scene names for both the testing and prior sets, which is valuable for reproducibility.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the nuScenes dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A.H., Vora, S., Liong, V.E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., Beijbom, O. (2020). *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 11621â€“11631.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is a multimodal dataset for autonomous driving, which includes various scenes collected across multiple locations. The authors specifically utilize it for their experiments, focusing on tasks related to online HD map construction and occupancy prediction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the nuScenes dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and reproducibility in research.
