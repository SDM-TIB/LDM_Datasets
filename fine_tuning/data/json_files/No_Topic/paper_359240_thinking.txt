To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-CryptO: Deep learning-based analysis of colon organoid morphology from brightfield images" by Lyan Abdul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for validation or analysis. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the results section typically details the findings related to those datasets.

In the **results section**, I notice that the authors describe the creation of two custom datasets for their analysis:
1. **Opacity Dataset**: This dataset contains images of organoids classified as opaque and transparent. It includes 1021 images of opaque organoids and 1457 images of transparent organoids.
2. **Budding Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of organoids classified as budding and non-budding. It contains 1081 images of budding organoids and 1395 images of non-budding organoids.

Next, I will check the **methods section** for more details on how these datasets were created and any additional information that might be relevant. The authors mention that the datasets were created from images obtained through montages and z-stacks of organoids cultured in a 24-well plate. They also specify that the datasets were split into training, validation, and test sets, and that the full training dataset is publicly accessible at the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository: https://osf.io/42r3g/.

Now, I will look for the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are custom datasets created by the authors, so they do not have external citations. Instead, I will note the repository link where the datasets can be accessed.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and the citation for the repository where they can be found.

The final entries for the datasets will be:
1. **Opacity Dataset**: Contains 1021 images of opaque organoids and 1457 images of transparent organoids. Available at: https://osf.io/42r3g/.
2. **Budding Dataset**: Contains 1081 images of budding organoids and 1395 images of non-budding organoids. Available at: https://osf.io/42r3g/.

This thorough approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their relevant citations from the research paper.
