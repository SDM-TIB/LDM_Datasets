To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Birth of a Transformer: A Memory Viewpoint" by Alberto Bietti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the study of transformers and their learning mechanisms but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup and results sections**. In the **synthetic setup section**, the authors describe a synthetic dataset used for their experiments, which consists of sequences generated from a bigram language model. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, although it is synthetic rather than a publicly available dataset.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention that they trained their models using mini-batch SGD with sequences sampled from their synthetic model. They specify that the sequences are generated based on a bigram model, but they do not provide a formal citation for this synthetic dataset since it is created for the purpose of their study.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will note that the only dataset discussed is the synthetic dataset created by the authors. 

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The dataset consists of sequences generated from a bigram language model, specifically designed for the experiments in this paper. It is not a publicly available dataset and does not have a formal citation.

Since there are no external datasets with citations, I will conclude my extraction process here. The only dataset mentioned is the synthetic one created for the study, and it does not have a formal citation as it is not published elsewhere.

In summary, the dataset extraction from this paper reveals that the authors utilized a synthetic dataset for their experiments, which is unique to their research and does not have a citation.
