To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Weakly Supervised Segmentation Network Embedding Cross-scale Attention Guidance and Noise-sensitive Constraint for Detecting Tertiary Lymphoid Structures of Pancreatic Tumors" by Bingxue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two collected datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, the authors mention two datasets collected from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (NDTH) and Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine (JHCM). 

In the **experiments section**, they provide specific details about these datasets:
1. **NDTH Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 whole slide images (WSIs) from 12 surgical pathology-confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients.
2. **JHCM Dataset**: This dataset includes 57 WSIs from 41 PDAC patients.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **acknowledgment and references sections**. However, since these datasets are likely original collections by the authors, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they were collected.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for referencing the datasets:

- For the **NDTH Dataset**:
  > Wang, B., Zou, L., Chen, J., Cao, Y., Cai, Z., Qiu, Y., Mao, L., Wang, Z., Chen, J., Gui, L., & Yang, X. (2023). A Weakly Supervised Segmentation Network Embedding Cross-scale Attention Guidance and Noise-sensitive Constraint for Detecting Tertiary Lymphoid Structures of Pancreatic Tumors. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, XX(X), XXXX-XXXX.

- For the **JHCM Dataset**:
  > Wang, B., Zou, L., Chen, J., Cao, Y., Cai, Z., Qiu, Y., Mao, L., Wang, Z., Chen, J., Gui, L., & Yang, X. (2023). A Weakly Supervised Segmentation Network Embedding Cross-scale Attention Guidance and Noise-sensitive Constraint for Detecting Tertiary Lymphoid Structures of Pancreatic Tumors. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, XX(X), XXXX-XXXX.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear manner, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details and citations. This will prepare me for any further processing or output generation needed.
