To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Global and Local Node Contexts for Text Generation from Knowledge Graphs" by Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract**. Here, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate significant improvements on two graph-to-text datasets, specifically the **AGENDA** and **WebNLG** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. In this section, the authors provide context about graph-to-text generation and mention the datasets again, reinforcing their importance in the experiments conducted.

I will then look into the **data and preprocessing** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly describe both datasets:

1. **AGENDA**: This dataset consists of knowledge graphs paired with scientific abstracts extracted from AI conference proceedings. Each instance includes a paper title, a knowledge graph, and the corresponding abstract. The authors note that entities correspond to scientific terms, often multi-word expressions.

2. **WebNLG**: This dataset contains knowledge graphs extracted from DBPedia, with the target text consisting of sentences that verbalize the graph.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **AGENDA**, the citation is:
  > Koncel-Kedziorski, R., Bekal, D., Luan, Y., Lapata, M., & Hajishirzi, H. (2019). Text Generation from Knowledge Graphs with Graph Transformers. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 2284–2293, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **WebNLG**, the citation is:
  > Gardent, C., Shimorina, A., Narayan, S., & Perez-Beltrachini, L. (2017). The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124–133, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
