To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Design Issues in Medical Expert System for Low Back Pain Management: Knowledge Representation, Inference Mechanism, and Conflict Resolution Using Bayesian Network" by Debarpita Santra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed system has been validated with cases of **thirty patients**, which suggests that there is a dataset related to these patients.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. The authors discuss the outcomes of their system based on the clinical information of thirty LBP patients collected from the **ESI Hospital Sealdah, Kolkata**. This indicates that the dataset consists of clinical records from these patients.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that the study group comprised patients diagnosed with specific LBP diseases, including **Sacroiliac Joint Arthropathy (SIJA)**, **Facet Joint Arthropathy (FJA)**, **Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc (PIVD)**, **Discogenic Pain (DP)**, and **Piriformis Syndrome (PS)**. This provides insight into the types of conditions represented in the dataset.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and ethical approval sections** to confirm that the data collection was conducted ethically and with proper permissions, which is crucial for the integrity of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Patient Dataset**: This dataset consists of clinical records from thirty patients diagnosed with various LBP diseases. The dataset includes clinical attributes relevant to the diagnosis of LBP.

Next, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, but it does reference the source of the patient data:

- For the patient dataset, the citation is:
  > Santra, D., Mandal, J. K., Basu, S. K., & Goswami, S. (2023). Addressing Design Issues in Medical Expert System for Low Back Pain Management: Knowledge Representation, Inference Mechanism, and Conflict Resolution Using Bayesian Network. *Journal of Medical Systems*, 47(1), 1-23. DOI: [insert DOI if available].

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and its citation for clarity and future reference.
