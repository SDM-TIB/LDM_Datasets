To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "K-Tangent Spaces on Riemannian Manifolds for Improved Pedestrian Detection" by Andres Sanin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **INRIA and DaimlerChrysler datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe the **INRIA dataset** as containing 2416 pedestrian samples and 1218 person-free images for training, along with 1126 pedestrian samples and 453 person-free images for testing. They also mention the challenges associated with this dataset, such as variations in pose and background.

The authors also describe the **DaimlerChrysler dataset**, which consists of three training sets and two test sets, each containing 4800 pedestrian samples and 5000 negative samples. They note that the positive samples are smaller in size (18×36) and that the dataset presents its own challenges due to the small sample size and difficult negative set.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **INRIA dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Dalal and B. Triggs. *Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection*. In IEEE Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), volume 1, pages 886–893, 2005.

- For the **DaimlerChrysler dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Munder and D. Gavrila. *An experimental study on pedestrian classification*. IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 28(11):1863–1868, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
