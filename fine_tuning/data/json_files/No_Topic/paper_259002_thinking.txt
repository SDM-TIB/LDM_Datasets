To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Google Crowdsourced Speech Corpora and Related Open-Source Resources for Low-Resource Languages and Dialects: An Overview" by Alena Butryna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors have released **38 datasets** for building text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications for various languages and dialects. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Program Overview)**, where the authors discuss the selection of languages and dialects. They mention specific languages from South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America, which suggests that datasets for these languages are part of the program. I will note down the languages mentioned and any specific datasets associated with them.

In **subsection 2.1 (Selection of Languages and Dialects)**, the authors provide a detailed list of languages for which they have collected speech corpora. I will extract the names of these languages and any relevant details about the datasets, such as the number of hours of speech collected.

The paper states that the collected corpora consist of over **1,500 hours of speech** and are freely available online. I will look for any specific dataset names or identifiers mentioned in this section or subsequent sections.

In **section 4 (Bibliographical References)**, I will check for any references that might provide full citations for the datasets. The authors may have cited specific works related to the datasets they have released. I will ensure to extract these citations accurately.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about each dataset, including the language or dialect it pertains to, the type of application (TTS or ASR), and the total amount of speech data available. I will also ensure to include the full citation for each dataset as mentioned in the references section.

Finally, I will organize the dataset information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is properly attributed with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
