To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizations of Multi-Agent Path Finding to Real-World Scenarios" by Hang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the methodologies used, which could hint at specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note them down carefully.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss **real-world applications** or **case studies**, as these often involve datasets that are crucial for validating the research findings. I will also look for any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their properties.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **Kiva Warehouse Dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset in the literature to provide an accurate citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and correctly formatted.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
