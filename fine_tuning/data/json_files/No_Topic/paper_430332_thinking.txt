To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anticipate & Collab: Data-driven Task Anticipation and Knowledge-driven Planning for Human-robot Collaboration" by Shivam Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its evaluation, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the household environments and scenarios used for testing. They mention that they created two households with different task execution patterns, but I need to check if they refer to any specific datasets or sources for these scenarios.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will need to extract the full citations for those datasets.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the information into a structured format. If I find any datasets, I will ensure to include the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The specific name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations for future reference or processing.
