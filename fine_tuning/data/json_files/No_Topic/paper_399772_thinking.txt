To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling Invariances via Neural Network Pruning" by Derek Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their framework on multiple deep learning models across **3 vision and 40 tabular datasets**. This indicates that there are several datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment setup** section, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that the experiments are run on **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN** for vision datasets, and they also refer to **40 tabular datasets** sourced from OpenML, UCI, and Kaggle.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the models evaluated on these datasets, which further confirms the datasets being used.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the vision datasets, I will find the citations for:

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

2. **CIFAR100**: The citation is the same as CIFAR10 since it is part of the same dataset collection:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

3. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*.

For the **40 tabular datasets**, the authors reference a benchmark paper by Kadra et al. (2021) that covers these datasets. Therefore, I will cite that paper as the source for the tabular datasets:
   > Kadra, A., Lindauer, M., Hutter, F., & Grabocka, J. (2021). *Well-tuned simple nets excel on tabular datasets*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 23928â€“23941.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
