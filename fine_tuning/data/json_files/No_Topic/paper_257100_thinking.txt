To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cardea: An Open Automated Machine Learning Framework for Electronic Health Records" by Sarah Alnegheimish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating their framework using **MIMIC-III** and **KAGGLE datasets**, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They state that they utilized two publicly available datasets:

1. **Kaggle’s Medical Appointment No-Shows dataset**: This dataset consists of 110,527 labeled scheduled appointments with 21 variables, including patient demographics and appointment details.

2. **MIMIC-III**: This is a relational electronic health records dataset that includes approximately 59,000 hospital admissions for 38,597 distinct patients, containing multiple attributes such as demographics, vital signs, and laboratory tests.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kaggle’s Medical Appointment No-Shows dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. “Kaggle Medical Appointment No Shows.” https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home, 2015.

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. C., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., ... & Mark, R. G. (2016). "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database." Scientific Data, 3, 160035. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.35.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
