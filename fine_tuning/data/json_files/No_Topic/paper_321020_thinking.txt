To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolving Deep Neural Networks for Collaborative Filtering" by Yuhan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **two benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MovieLens dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for collaborative filtering tasks, particularly in recommendation systems.
2. **Pinterest dataset**: The authors provide a link to this dataset, indicating it is also used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. 

For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
> Harper, F.M., Konstan, J.A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 1–19.

For the **Pinterest dataset**, since the authors provide a link rather than a formal citation, I will note that it is referenced as:
> Pinterest dataset. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/xueatalphabeta/academic-projects.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MovieLens dataset**: A widely used dataset for evaluating collaborative filtering algorithms.
   - Citation: Harper, F.M., Konstan, J.A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 1–19.

2. **Pinterest dataset**: A dataset used for collaborative filtering tasks, with a link provided for access.
   - Citation: Pinterest dataset. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/xueatalphabeta/academic-projects.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
