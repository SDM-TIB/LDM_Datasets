To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Build Your Own Robot Friend: An Open-Source Learning Module for Accessible and Engaging AI Education" by Zhonghao Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an open-source learning module but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **introduction** and **learning module design** sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of AI education but do not mention any datasets. Moving on to the **learning module design** section, I will focus on the parts that detail the educational content and any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **learning module design**, I find that the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for a binary classification task related to human perception. This dataset is crucial for the learning module as it helps students understand machine learning concepts through practical application.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **CelebA Dataset**: 
  > Liu, Z.; Luo, P.; Wang, X.; and Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to using a modified version of the CIFAR10 dataset in the context of teaching machine learning concepts. However, since they specifically mention adapting the tutorial to use the CelebA dataset, I will prioritize that dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset identified in the paper. 

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **CelebA Dataset**: Used for training a convolutional neural network for a binary classification task related to smiling.

I will ensure that the citation is formatted correctly and is ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
