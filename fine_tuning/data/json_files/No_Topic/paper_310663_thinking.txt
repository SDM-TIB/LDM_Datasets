To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A fuzzy-rough uncertainty measure to discover bias encoded explicitly or implicitly in features of structured pattern classification datasets" by Gonzalo NÃ¡poles and Lisa Koutsoviti Koumeri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need to measure bias in tabular data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the use of a bias quantification measure and refer to existing literature. This section may provide insights into specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors state that they use the **German Credit dataset** for their simulations. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the dataset's application in their analysis. The authors describe how they preprocess the German Credit dataset, indicating its significance in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the German Credit dataset. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include it accurately.

The citation for the German Credit dataset is:
> Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
