To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exposing propaganda: an analysis of stylistic cues comparing human annotations and machine classification" by Géraud Faye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the **PPN dataset**, which stands for Propagandist Pseudo-News, indicating that this is a key dataset in the study. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, describing it as a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles from identified propaganda sources.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the dataset is detailed in **Section 2**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the PPN dataset, including its sources, languages, and the number of documents. This section is crucial as it contains specific details about the dataset's composition.

In **Section 2**, the authors describe the PPN dataset as being extracted from five sources, including:
1. **rrn.media**: A pro-Russia news website with articles in multiple languages.
2. **tribunalukraine.info**: A site accusing Ukraine of war crimes, available in several languages.
3. **waronfakes.com**: A site denying Russian war crimes, providing summaries of allegations.
4. **notrepays.today** and **lavirgule.news**: French-language sites publishing polarizing news.

The authors also provide tables detailing the distribution of articles by source and language, which is important for understanding the dataset's diversity.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PPN dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is shared on a GitHub repository, which is also a critical piece of information for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can construct it based on the information given in the paper.

The citation for the PPN dataset can be formatted as follows:
> Géraud Faye, Benjamin Icard, Morgane Casanova, Julien Chanson, François Maine, François Bancilhon, Guillaume Gadek, Guillaume Gravier, and Paul Égré. *PPN Dataset: Propagandist Pseudo-News*. Available at: https://github.com/hybrinfox/ppn.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
- The primary dataset extracted from the paper is the **PPN dataset**.
- It is a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles from identified propaganda sources.
- The dataset is available on GitHub, which is essential for citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
