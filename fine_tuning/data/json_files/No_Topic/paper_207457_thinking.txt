To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding search in the space of empirical ML" by Bronwyn L Woods, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on empirical machine learning, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the dimensions of empirical machine learning, including the importance of data, but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might discuss empirical results or methodologies. In section 2, titled "Empirical machine learning," the author emphasizes the importance of datasets in empirical results but does not name any specific datasets. The section discusses the variability introduced by datasets and the implications of using benchmark datasets, but it does not provide concrete examples.

I will also check the **recommendations section** for any mention of datasets. While the author discusses the need for open-world experimentation and the importance of empirical results, there are no specific datasets cited.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the cited works. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and critiques of machine learning practices rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is more on the conceptual framework of empirical machine learning rather than on specific data sources.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting the absence of specific datasets in the paper while highlighting the discussion around the importance of data in empirical machine learning research.
