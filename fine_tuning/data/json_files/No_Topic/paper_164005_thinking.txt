To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can we steal your vocal identity from the Internet?: Initial investigation of cloning Obama’s voice using GAN, WaveNet and low-quality found data" by Jaime Lorenzo-Trueba et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **ASVspoof2015 database**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** where the authors discuss the ASVspoof2015 database in detail, highlighting its significance in developing and evaluating methods for preventing spoofing of automatic speaker verification systems. This confirms that the ASVspoof2015 dataset is crucial for their research.

In the **methods section**, specifically under **3.1 (Corpora for speech enhancement training)**, the authors describe the datasets used for training their speech enhancement models. They mention the **Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) voice cloning toolkit (VCTK) corpus** as a clean speech corpus, which consists of a subset of 28 speakers.

The paper also describes various corrupted versions of the VCTK corpus, such as **Device Recorded VCTK corpus**, **Noisy VCTK**, **Reverberant VCTK**, and **Noisy Reverberant VCTK**. Each of these datasets is used to enhance the robustness of the speech enhancement system.

Additionally, the authors discuss the **Obama’s found data**, which is collected from various public sources, including YouTube videos and interviews. This dataset is significant for their experiments on voice cloning.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

6. **Obama’s Found Data**: The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset as it is collected from various public sources, but it is primarily from YouTube videos and interviews.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
