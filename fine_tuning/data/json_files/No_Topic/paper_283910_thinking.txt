To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AHMoSe: A Knowledge-Based Visual Support System for Selecting Regression Machine Learning Models" by Diego Rojo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a use case scenario in the viticulture domain, specifically grape quality prediction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to grape quality.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe the data observations used for their simulation study. Here, they mention that the data corresponds to one grape variety (Vitis vinifera cv. Agiorgitiko) collected from 48 cells in a vineyard in Central Greece over the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to grape quality prediction.

In this section, the authors detail the features used for the models, including total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), total skin anthocyanins (Anth), and berry fresh weight (BW). They also mention that the grape quality score (GTQ) was provided by five grape growers and winemakers, which further confirms the existence of a dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model for grape quality prediction, which is based on prior expert knowledge and rules provided by human experts. The relevant citation for the fuzzy inference system is:

- For the fuzzy inference system:
  > Tagarakis, A., Koundouras, S., Papageorgiou, E., Dikopoulou, Z., Fountas, S., & Gemtos, T. (2014). A fuzzy inference system to model grape quality in vineyards. *Precision Agriculture*, 15(5), 555-578. doi:10.1007/s11119-014-9354-9.

Additionally, the authors mention using the AutoML system from H2O.ai for generating models, which is relevant for understanding the context of the datasets used. The citation for H2O.ai is:

- For H2O.ai:
  > Hall, P., Kurka, M., & Bartz, A. (2021). Using H2O Driverless AI. Version 1.9.2.1. H2O.ai, Inc. Retrieved from http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/booklets/DriverlessAIBooklet.pdf

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
