To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Poisoning Attacks on Stochastic Bandits" by Fang Liu and Ness Shroff, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework for offline attacks on bandit algorithms but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. This section typically provides details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors conducted experiments, they likely used specific datasets that should be documented.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. Often, datasets are referenced in the context of previous works, and the authors may provide full citations for these datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will look for specific phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to pinpoint where the datasets are mentioned. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down the relevant information such as the dataset name, size, and any unique features.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced the dataset to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Document each dataset with its name, description, and citation for future reference.
