To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fractal structures in Adversarial Prediction" by Rina Panigrahy and Preyas Popat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss experiments or results. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the use of specific datasets.

If the paper discusses any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Fractal Random Walk Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will note the original source or paper where the dataset was introduced or described.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
