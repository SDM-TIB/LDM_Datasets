To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Perceptual Image Compression using Deep Convolution Networks" by Aaditya Prakash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **Kodak PhotoCD dataset** and the **MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **Kodak PhotoCD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24 images primarily featuring natural outdoor scenes. It is well-known in the field of image processing and serves as a benchmark for evaluating image compression techniques.

2. **MIT Saliency Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,000 images and is used to assess saliency detection algorithms. The authors specifically mention that they focus on the 'Outdoor Man-made' and 'Outdoor Natural' categories, which consist of 200 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kodak PhotoCD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kodak. *Kodak PhotoCD Image Library*. Available at: https://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/photography/photocd/photocd.htm

- For the **MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > Judd, T., Durand, F., & Adelson, E. H. (2009). *A Benchmark of Computational Models of Saliency to Predict Human Fixations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1-8.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics, while adhering to the specified format for documentation.
