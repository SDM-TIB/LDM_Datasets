To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dancing in the syntax forest: fast, accurate and explainable sentiment analysis with SALSA" by Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and planning sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the SALSA project and its goals but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the project and its funding, which may hint at the types of datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their approaches to sentiment analysis. They mention that they will evaluate their methods on **freely-available sentiment analysis corpora**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to find their specific names.

In this section, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **SemEval 2022 Task 10 corpora**: This dataset covers five different languages and includes annotations for individual polarity targets, making it suitable for both polarity classification and fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks.

2. **TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish from Rest-Mex 2023**: This dataset is used to evaluate performance in a noisy context, particularly focusing on the Spanish market.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SemEval 2022 Task 10 corpora**, the citation is:

Stanovsky, R. Kumar, A. Palmer, N. Schneider, S. Singh, S. Ratan (Eds.), Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), Association for Computational Linguistics, Seattle, United States, 2022, pp. 1280–1295. URL: https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.180. doi:10.18653/v1/2022.semeval-1.180.

- For the **TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish from Rest-Mex 2023**, the citation is:
  > M. Ángel Álvarez-Carmona, A. Díaz-Pacheco, R. Aranda, A. Y. Rodríguez-González, V. Muñiz-Sánchez, A. P. López-Monroy, F. Sánchez-Vega, L. Bustio-Martínez, Overview of rest-mex at iberlef 2023: Research on sentiment analysis task for Mexican tourist texts, Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural 71 (2023) 425–436. URL: http://journal.sepln.org/sepln/ojs/ojs/index.php/pln/article/view/6572.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
