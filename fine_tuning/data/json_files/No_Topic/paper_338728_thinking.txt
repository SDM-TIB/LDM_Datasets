To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation and Theoretical Analysis for Representation Learning: A Survey" by Kento Nozawa and Issei Sato, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experimental settings and evaluations**. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus on representation learning, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **experimental settings** sections, as they often contain references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of representation learning and its applications, but they do not specify any datasets. I will then move to the **evaluation methods** section, particularly sections that detail experimental settings and datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of evaluating representation learning algorithms. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. It contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **YouTube-8M**: A large-scale video classification dataset that consists of millions of YouTube video IDs and their associated labels.
3. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **YouTube-8M**, the citation is:
  > Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. *YouTube-8M: A Large-Scale Video Classification Benchmark*. arXiv:1609.08675v1 [cs.CV], 2016.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
