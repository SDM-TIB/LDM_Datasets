To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Selection: A Fully Supervised Camera Selection Network for Surgery Recordings" by Ryo Hachiuma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They mention that they recorded six different types of plastic surgeries using five cameras attached to a surgical lamp. This section will likely contain the specifics of the dataset, including the number of surgeries, the type of surgeries, and the recording setup.

In this section, the authors also mention that the video recordings were approved by the Keio University School of Medicine Ethics Committee, and that informed consent was obtained from all patients. This is important ethical information that may be relevant when describing the dataset.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Surgery Dataset**: The dataset consists of recordings of six different types of plastic surgeries, captured using five cameras. Each surgery lasts approximately 30 minutes, recorded at 30 frames per second, and the authors subsampled every five frames for their analysis. The ground-truth annotations were created by a single expert.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is created by the authors themselves and does not reference an external source, I will note that the dataset is original and created specifically for this study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation details. Since the dataset is original, I will indicate that it is a proprietary dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the final output, ensuring that it is clear and informative for anyone reviewing the research paper or utilizing the dataset in future work.
