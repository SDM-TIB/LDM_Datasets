To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Optimization in Dynamic Environments: Improved Regret Rates for Strongly Convex Problems" by Aryan Mokhtari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their findings. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their properties.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will extract the relevant information from there. This section typically lists the datasets used, along with descriptions of their contents, formats, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will search for it in the literature to ensure I have the correct and complete reference.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
