To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Order-Free Tag Relations for Context-Aware Recommendation" by Junmo Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical results on two different domains, Instagram and Stack Overflow, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Instagram Dataset**: This dataset consists of 87,872 posts and 907 unique tags. It includes multi-modal context features such as images, location, time, and text descriptions.

2. **Stack Overflow Dataset**: This dataset contains 81,320 posts and 3,897 unique tags. It utilizes text features from the title and body of questions, as the context information such as time is not relevant for predicting tags.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were constructed and their significance for the study. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (Instagram and Stack Overflow) are not typically cited in the same way as academic papers. Instead, I will note the sources from which the datasets were derived:

- For the **Instagram Dataset**, the authors mention that it was constructed based on seed tags and filtered posts, but do not provide a formal citation since it is an original dataset created for this study.

- For the **Stack Overflow Dataset**, they reference a publicly available corpus called StackSample, which is a subset of Stack Overflow Q&A posts. The citation for this dataset is:
  > StackSample. (n.d.). *Stack Overflow Q&A posts*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflw/stacksample

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations as required.

1. **Instagram Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset containing 87,872 posts with multi-modal context features (images, location, time, text) and 907 unique tags.
   - Citation: Not formally cited as it is an original dataset created for this study.

2. **Stack Overflow Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset containing 81,320 posts with text features from questions and 3,897 unique tags.
   - Citation: StackSample. (n.d.). *Stack Overflow Q&A posts*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflw/stacksample

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
