To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation for Environmental Sound Classification" by Justin Salamon and Juan Pablo Bello, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of audio data augmentation to address data scarcity, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that several new datasets have been released for environmental sound classification, indicating that they will likely reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the **UrbanSound8K dataset**. This dataset is described as comprising 8,732 sound clips of up to 4 seconds in duration, spanning 10 environmental sound classes. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UrbanSound8K dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **UrbanSound8K dataset**:
  > J. Salamon, C. Jacoby, and J. P. Bello. "A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research." In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM-MM’14), pages 1041–1044, Orlando, FL, USA, Nov. 2014.

Additionally, the authors mention other datasets in the introduction, such as the ESC dataset and TUT sound events dataset. I will look for their details as well.

- For **ESC dataset**:
  > K. J. Piczak. "ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification." In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pages 1015–1018, Brisbane, Australia, Oct. 2015.

- For **TUT sound events dataset**:
  > A. Mesaros, E. Fagerlund, A. Hiltunen, T. Heittola, and T. Virtanen. "TUT sound events 2016, development dataset." Available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45759, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
