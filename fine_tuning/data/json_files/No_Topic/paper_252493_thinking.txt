To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Time Asymptotics in Deep Learning" by Carlos Esteve-YagÃ¼e et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in the research. In the abstract, I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks that the authors evaluated their methods against.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where authors typically provide context for their work, including any datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "our experiments were conducted on".

Then, I will examine the **methods or experiments sections**. These sections usually detail the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "MNIST dataset", I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively and comprehensively.
