To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Causally Disentangled Representations via the Principle of Independent Causal Mechanisms" by Aneesh Komanduri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Pendulum Dataset**: This dataset consists of causal variables related to a pendulum system, specifically designed to evaluate the proposed framework. The authors mention that it consists of 7K images generated by 4 ground-truth causal variables.

2. **Flow Dataset**: This dataset is another synthetic dataset consisting of 8K images, generated by 4 ground-truth causal variables related to water flow dynamics.

3. **CausalCircuit Dataset**: This dataset is created to explore causal representation learning and consists of images generated by 4 ground-truth latent causal variables. The authors note that it consists of 35K training samples and 10K testing samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Pendulum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, M., Liu, F., Chen, Z., Shen, X., Hao, J., & Wang, J. (2021). CausalVAE: Disentangled representation learning via neural structural causal models. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Flow Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work:
  > Yang, M., Liu, F., Chen, Z., Shen, X., Hao, J., & Wang, J. (2021). CausalVAE: Disentangled representation learning via neural structural causal models. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **CausalCircuit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brehmer, J., De Haan, P., Lippe, P., & Cohen, T. (2022). Weakly supervised causal representation learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper referencing.
