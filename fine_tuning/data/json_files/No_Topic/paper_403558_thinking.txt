To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Membership Inference Attacks against Classification Models" by Shlomit Shachor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses a novel framework for membership inference attacks but does not mention specific datasets. However, the introduction emphasizes the importance of assessing privacy risks in machine learning models, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention several models and datasets used for evaluation. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **GLUE SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and is mentioned in the context of the textattack/bert-base-uncased model.
2. **GLUE CoLA Dataset**: This dataset is used for linguistic acceptability classification and is associated with the textattack/roberta-base model.
3. **Rotten Tomatoes Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and is mentioned in relation to the roberta-base model fine-tuned for this task.

The authors provide links to the datasets, which is helpful for citation purposes. I will ensure to include these links in the citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may not always provide direct citations for datasets, but I will look for any papers or resources that describe these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For the **GLUE SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Pruksachatkun, Y., Nangia, N., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., & Levy, O. (2018). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP (pp. 353-355).

- For the **GLUE CoLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. (2019). *Neural Network Acceptability Judgments*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1424-1434).

- For the **Rotten Tomatoes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). *Seeing Stars: Exploiting Class Relationships for Sentiment Categorization with Respect to Rating Scales*. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 115-124).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
