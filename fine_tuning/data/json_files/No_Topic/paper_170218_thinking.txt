To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilient Learning-Based Control for Synchronization of Passive Multi-Agent Systems under Attack" by Arash Rahnama and Panos J. Antsaklis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include specific datasets that the authors relied on.

I will then focus on the **methodology** section, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section is crucial as it often details the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for specific phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on."

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets. This can provide additional context and confirmation that the datasets were indeed used in the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and full citations as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
   - **Citation**: Full citation in the appropriate format.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
