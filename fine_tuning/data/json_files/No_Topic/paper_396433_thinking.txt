To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Resource Allocation for U-Shaped Parallel Split Learning" by Song Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or methodology sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using two datasets for their experiments: **HAM10000** and **MNIST**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they evaluate the learning performance of their proposed U-PSL framework using these datasets. They compare the performance of their method against other distributed learning baselines, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **HAM10000 dataset**, the citation is:
   > P. Tschandl, C. Rosendahl, and H. Kittler. *The HAM10000 Dataset, A Large Collection of Multi-source Dermatoscopic Images of Common Pigmented Skin Lesions*. Sci. Data, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 1–9, 2018.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proc IEEE Inst Electr Electron Eng, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
