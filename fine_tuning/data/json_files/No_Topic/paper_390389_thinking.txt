To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Annealed Importance Sampling with Constant Rate Progress" by Shirin Goshtasbpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically check for mentions of benchmark datasets or any datasets used for empirical validation of the proposed method. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, dimensions, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Smith, J., & Doe, A. (1988). *Pima Indians Diabetes Database*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
