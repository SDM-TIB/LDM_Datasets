To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tableaux for the Logic of Strategically Knowing How" by Yanjun Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections** to see if any datasets are referenced or discussed. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss methodology, experiments, or results. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section specifically dedicated to datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive details. This section may provide insights into the datasets' origins, how they were collected, and their relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Example Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Conference. DOI/URL.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
