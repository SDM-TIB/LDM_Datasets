To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action4D: Real-time Action Recognition in the Crowd and Clutter" by Quanzeng You and Hao Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new method for action recognition and mention the collection of a new 4D dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of action recognition in cluttered environments and hint at the need for a dataset that captures these scenarios. They mention that they collected and labeled a new 4D dataset, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the **ground truth experimentation setup**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They describe the dataset as containing 16 actions performed by 15 subjects in various settings, including everyday life scenarios. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides specific details about its composition.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **4D Action Recognition Dataset**: This dataset includes 68,000 frames in the training videos, 6,000 frames in the validating videos, 10,000 frames in the single-people testing videos, and 6,000 in the multiple-subject testing videos. It covers 16 actions such as drinking, clapping, and reading, performed by subjects with varying body shapes and heights.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the authors mention that they will publish the dataset, it may not have a formal citation yet. In this case, I will note that the dataset is forthcoming and provide the relevant details as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, while also noting the authors and the title of the paper for proper citation.

The final dataset entry will look like this:
- **Dataset Name**: 4D Action Recognition Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 68,000 frames for training, 6,000 for validation, 10,000 for single-person testing, and 6,000 for multiple-subject testing, featuring 16 actions performed by 15 subjects in various settings.
- **Citation**: Quanzeng You and Hao Jiang. *Action4D: Real-time Action Recognition in the Crowd and Clutter*. Microsoft, USA.

After compiling this information, I will ensure it is structured appropriately for any downstream processing or review.
