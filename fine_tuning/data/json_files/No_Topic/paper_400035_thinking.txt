To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Collapse for Unconstrained Feature Model under Cross-entropy Loss with Imbalanced Data" by Wanli Hong and Shuyang Ling, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset1**: This dataset consists of three giant clusters with specific configurations: 
   - Cluster A: 4 classes, each with 5000 samples.
   - Cluster B: 3 classes, each with 4000 samples.
   - Cluster C: 3 classes, each with 3000 samples.

2. **Dataset2**: This dataset is more imbalanced than Dataset1:
   - Cluster A: 4 classes, each with 5000 samples.
   - Cluster B: 2 classes, each with 3000 samples.
   - Cluster C: 4 classes, each with 1000 samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described in the context of the experiments without specific external citations, as they appear to be custom datasets created for the study.

Now, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset1**:
   - Description: Contains three clusters with varying numbers of classes and samples.
   - Configuration: 
     - Cluster A: 4 classes, 5000 samples each.
     - Cluster B: 3 classes, 4000 samples each.
     - Cluster C: 3 classes, 3000 samples each.

2. **Dataset2**:
   - Description: More imbalanced than Dataset1, also contains three clusters.
   - Configuration:
     - Cluster A: 4 classes, 5000 samples each.
     - Cluster B: 2 classes, 3000 samples each.
     - Cluster C: 4 classes, 1000 samples each.

Since these datasets do not have external citations, I will note that they are defined within the context of the paper itself.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
