To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biogenic magnetic nanoparticles in plants" by S.V. Gorobets et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the examination of samples from various plants, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these samples.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Results and Discussion** and any **Methods** sections that might describe the experimental setup and data collection. In this paper, the authors mention examining samples from **Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco)**, **Solanum tuberosum (potato)**, and **Pisum sativum (pea)**. This indicates that these plant species are part of the datasets.

I will also check **Table 1** and **Table 3**, which present comparative data on the presence and characteristics of biogenic magnetic nanoparticles (BMNs) in these plants. The tables provide quantitative data that can be considered part of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets:

1. **Dataset of Plant Samples**: This dataset includes samples from:
   - **Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco)**
   - **Solanum tuberosum (potato)**
   - **Pisum sativum (pea)**

2. **Dataset of BMNs Characteristics**: This dataset includes the maximum size and number of BMNs in the examined plant tissues, as presented in **Table 3**.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations for the plant species and their relevance to the study are as follows:

- For **Nicotiana tabacum**:
  > Murashige, T., & Skoog, F. (1962). A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassay with tobacco tissue culture. *Physiologia Plantarum*, 15(3), 165-170.

- For **Solanum tuberosum**:
  > Gorobets, S.V., Gorobets, O.Yu., & Bulaievska, M. (2018). Comparative characteristics of biogenic magnetic nanoparticles in plant, fungi and animal organisms. *IEEE AIM*, 4-7.

- For **Pisum sativum**:
  > Tanimoto, E. (2005). Regulation of root growth by plant hormones â€“ Roles for auxin and gibberellin. *Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences*, 24(4), 249-265.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
