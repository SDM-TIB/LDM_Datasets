To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Epistemic Planning: Generalised Gossiping" by Martin C. Cooper et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for testing their algorithms or models, I will record the name of the dataset and any relevant details provided, such as the number of instances, features, or any specific attributes that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier used in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as provided in the paper's references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration or replication of the study by others.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
