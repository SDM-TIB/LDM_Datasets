To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Program Synthesis with Best-First Bottom-Up Search" by Saqib Ameen and Levi H. S. Lelis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Empirical Results)** or any dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In section 6, the authors describe three benchmark problems:
1. **SyGuS Benchmark**: This includes 205 string manipulation problems from various sources, such as the SyGuS competition and real-world problems from StackOverflow.
2. **Handcrafted String Manipulation Problems**: A set of 38 problems specifically designed for testing.
3. **Bit-Vector Problems**: A collection of 27 problems sourced from the "Hacker’s Delight" book.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **SyGuS Benchmark**, the citation is:
> Alur, R., Bodik, R., Juniwal, G., Martin, M., Raghothaman, M., Seshia, S., Singh, R., Solar-Lezama, A., Torlak, E., & Udupa, A. (2013). Syntax-guided synthesis. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), pp. 1–17.

For the **Handcrafted String Manipulation Problems**, the citation is:
> Odena, A., & Sutton, C. (2020). Learning to represent programs with property signatures. In 8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, April 26-30, 2020.

For the **Bit-Vector Problems**, the citation is:
> Warren, H. S. (2013). Hacker’s delight. Addison-Wesley.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.
