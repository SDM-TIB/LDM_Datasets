To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal clustering: design of cluster experiments under network interference" by Davide Viviano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of unique network data from Facebook users and existing data from a field experiment, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using "unique network data from the universe of Facebookâ€™s users" and "data from a field experiment conducted in rural China by Cai et al. (2015)." This indicates that there are at least two datasets to document.

I will then check the **references** section to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Facebook Network Data**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Facebook data, but it is implied that the data is proprietary and not publicly available. Therefore, I will note it as "Facebook Network Data (proprietary, not publicly available)."

2. **Cai et al. (2015) Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of a field experiment in rural China. I will look up the full citation for this paper:
   > Cai, J., Janvry, A. D., & Sadoulet, E. (2015). Social networks and the decision to insure. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 7(2), 81-108.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize them:

- **Facebook Network Data**: Proprietary data from Facebook users, used for analyzing network effects in experiments.
- **Cai et al. (2015) Dataset**: 
   > Cai, J., Janvry, A. D., & Sadoulet, E. (2015). Social networks and the decision to insure. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 7(2), 81-108.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
