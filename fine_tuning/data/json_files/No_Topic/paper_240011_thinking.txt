To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topological Data Analysis in Text Classification: Extracting Features with Additive Information" by Shaﬁe Gholizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to text classification and mention the use of word embeddings and TF-IDF vectors. However, I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. They mention using the **Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset from Kaggle**, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments. The authors specify that they selected movie plots annotated by four major genres: Drama, Comedy, Action, and Romance, and that the dataset contains 11,500 total records.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** for any mention of the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset. If the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will use the information provided in the experiments section to construct a citation.

The citation for the **Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset** is:
> Jallouli, A. (2020). *Genre classification based on wiki movies plots*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/aminejallouli/genre-classification-based-on-wiki-movies-plots/data

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Wikipedia Movie Plots Dataset**: This dataset contains 11,500 movie plots annotated by four major genres: Drama, Comedy, Action, and Romance. It is used for the task of document classification based on the plot texts.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
