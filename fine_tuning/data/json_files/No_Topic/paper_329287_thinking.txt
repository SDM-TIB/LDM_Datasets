To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New Insights on Target Speaker Extraction" by Mohamed Elminshawi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study, but the details about specific datasets are likely found in the experimental design section.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Experimental Design)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe four datasets:

1. **TCD-TIMIT**: This dataset consists of synchronized audio-visual recordings of 59 speakers reading sentences from the TIMIT corpus. The authors mention that it was collected in a controlled environment, ensuring high-quality audio and video clips.

2. **LRS3**: This is a large-scale audio-visual corpus obtained from TED and TEDx talks. The authors note that it has a tremendous variability in spoken sentences, visual appearances, and speaking styles.

3. **WSJ0Mix**: Created from the WSJ0 corpus, this dataset includes single-channel 2 and 3 speaker mixtures. The authors specify that it is a standard benchmark for speaker separation.

4. **LibriMix**: This dataset comprises 2-speaker and 3-speaker mixtures created from the LibriSpeech corpus. The authors provide details about the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) used in the mixtures.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **TCD-TIMIT**, the citation is:
  > N. Harte and E. Gillen. "TCD-TIMIT: An audio-visual corpus of continuous speech." IEEE Trans. Multimedia, vol. 17, no. 5, pp. 603â€“615, May 2015.

- For **LRS3**, the citation is:
  > T. Afouras, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. "LRS3-TED: A large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition." Oct. 2018, arXiv:1809.00496.

- For **WSJ0Mix**, the citation is:
  > J. Garofolo, D. Graff, D. Paul, and D. Pallett. "CSR-I (WSJ0) Complete LDC93S6A," 1993.

- For **LibriMix**, the citation is:
  > J. Cosentino, M. Pariente, S. Cornell, A. Deleforge, and E. Vincent. "LibriMix: An open-source dataset for generalizable speech separation." May 2020, arXiv:2005.11262.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
