To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Difference in Differences and Ratio in Ratios for Limited Dependent Variables" by Sanghyeok Lee and Myoung-jae Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their methods with simulation and empirical studies, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical analysis section** where the authors describe their data sources. They mention using data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** for years 2007-2013, which is a health-related telephone survey in the U.S. This indicates that the BRFSS dataset is one of the primary datasets used in their analysis.

In this section, the authors also specify that they analyze 12 outcome variables derived from the BRFSS data, including variables such as ‘any health insurance’, ‘any primary doctor’, and others, along with their respective sample sizes. This detailed description confirms the use of the BRFSS dataset for their empirical analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BRFSS dataset. The citation for the BRFSS is typically as follows:
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)*. [Online]. Available: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/

Additionally, the authors reference a previous study by Barbaresco, Courtemanche, and Qi (2015) that utilized similar data. I will also include this citation as it pertains to the dataset used:
> Barbaresco, S., Courtemanche, C.J., & Qi, Y. (2015). *Impacts of the Affordable Care Act dependent coverage provision on health-related outcomes of young adults*. Journal of Health Economics, 40, 54-68.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
