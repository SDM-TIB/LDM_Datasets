To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tapping the Potential of Coherence and Syntactic Features in Neural Models for Automatic Essay Scoring" by Xinying Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and reference previous works. I will pay attention to any datasets that might be cited or described in relation to their methodology.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section III, where the authors mention the **ASAP dataset**. They provide a statistical description of this dataset, including the number of essays, average length, and score range, which confirms its relevance to their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ASAP dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **ASAP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaveh Taghipour and Hwee Tou Ng. *A neural approach to automated essay scoring*. In Proceedings of the 2016 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1882â€“1891, 2016.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all necessary details to describe the dataset accurately. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
