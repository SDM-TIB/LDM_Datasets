To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REGroup: Rank-aggregating Ensemble of Generative Classifiers for Robust Predictions" by Lokender Tiwari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their defense strategy on the **ImageNet validation set**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their evaluations and provide details about various subsets of this dataset:

1. **V50K**: The full ImageNet validation set containing 50,000 images.
2. **V10K**: A subset of 10,000 correctly classified images from the V50K set, with 10 images per class.
3. **V2K**: A subset of 2,000 correctly classified images from the V50K set, with 2 images per class.
4. **V10C**: A subset of correctly classified images of 10 sufficiently different classes.

The authors also provide a table summarizing these datasets, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset referenced is the **ImageNet dataset**, which is widely known and has a standard citation:

- For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

Since the subsets (V50K, V10K, V2K, V10C) are derived from the ImageNet dataset, they do not require separate citations; the original ImageNet citation suffices.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
