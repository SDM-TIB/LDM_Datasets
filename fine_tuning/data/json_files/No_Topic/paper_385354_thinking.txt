To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Discovery of Continuous Skills on a Sphere" by Takahisa Imagawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific environments or datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the environments used for testing their proposed method, DISCS. In this section, they mention conducting experiments in the **MuJoCo Ant robot control environments**. This indicates that the MuJoCo environment is a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 4) to see if any other datasets are referenced in comparison to their method. However, it seems that the focus is primarily on the MuJoCo environments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper primarily discusses the MuJoCo Ant robot control environments, I will need to find the citation for this dataset.

The citation for the MuJoCo environment is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5026-5033.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
