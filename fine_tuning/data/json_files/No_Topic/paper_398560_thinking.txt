To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Voice Morphing: Two Identities in One Voice" by Sushanta K. Pani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Librispeech dataset**, which is a strong lead for a dataset to include.

Next, I will examine the **experimental protocol section** (Section III) where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Librispeech dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its size (1000 hours of audio data) and the specific subset they utilized (the 500-hour subset).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Librispeech dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Librispeech dataset**, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its characteristics as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
