To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise Reduction in X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy with Convolutional Neural Networks Encoder-Decoder Models" by Tatiana Konstantinova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in previous studies or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, which typically contains detailed information about the experimental setup and the data used for training and validation. In this paper, the authors mention that the training data consists of experiments for 7 samples from 3 different material groups (A, B, and C). This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these experiments.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or provide additional details about the data collection process. For example, the paper includes a table that outlines the distribution of examples between training and validation sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets, which can provide further insights into the datasets used. They mention that the test data are collected in a similar fashion to the training/validation data, indicating that there are distinct datasets for testing the model's performance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets from previous studies, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
