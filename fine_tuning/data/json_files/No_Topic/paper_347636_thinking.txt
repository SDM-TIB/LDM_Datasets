To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Generator-Ranker Learning for Natural Language Generation" by Weizhou Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "four public datasets across three common generation scenarios," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset is used for abstractive summarization and is referenced as a benchmark in the paper.
2. **SAMSum**: This dataset is utilized for conversational summarization.
3. **SQuAD 1.1**: Originally a machine reading comprehension dataset, it is adapted for question generation in this context.
4. **PersonaChat**: This dataset is employed for dialogue generation.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend.

- For **SAMSum**, the citation is:

- For **SQuAD 1.1**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas.

- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too? In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204–2213, Melbourne, Australia.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
