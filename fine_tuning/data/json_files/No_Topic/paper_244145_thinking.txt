To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ethical Adversaries: Towards Mitigating Unfairness with Adversarial Machine Learning" by Pieter Delobelle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their framework on "well-studied datasets in the fairness literature — including COMPAS." This indicates that datasets are indeed discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their framework on three datasets: **COMPAS**, **German Credit**, and **Adult**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of instances, features, and the protected attributes used.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,278 instances and is used to predict the risk of recidivism. The protected attribute is race, and it contains 12 features.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 instances with 20 features. The protected attribute is age, with a threshold at 25 years.

3. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset has 32,000 instances and 9 features. The protected attribute is gender, and the target variable is whether an individual earns more than 50,000 USD.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **COMPAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angwin, J., & Larson, J. (2016). Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. and it’s biased against blacks. ProPublica.

- For the **German Credit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hofmann, M., & Klinkenberg, R. (2015). German Credit Dataset. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Adult dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kohavi, R. (1996). Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid. In KDD (Vol. 96, pp. 202-207).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
