To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Based Cost Model for Automatic Code Optimization" by Riyadh Baghdadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for a large dataset to train their deep learning model. They state that "training DNNs requires a large data set and only a small number of programs have ever been written in TIRAMISU." This indicates that they have created a dataset specifically for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **data generation section** (Section 3), where the authors describe how they generated the dataset. They mention that they developed a code generator to create random programs and sequences of code transformations, resulting in a dataset of approximately 1.8 million programs. Each data point in the dataset is a triplet consisting of a program, a sequence of code transformations, and the measured speedup.

The authors also specify that they generated 56,250 random algorithms and for each algorithm, they created 32 random sequences of code transformations. This detailed description confirms the existence of a dataset created for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors and not from an external source, it may not have a traditional citation. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper about the dataset creation process.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Randomly Generated Code Transformation Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing approximately 1.8 million programs generated by a code generator, each consisting of a triplet of (program, sequence of code transformations, measured speedup).
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is generated by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations as required.
