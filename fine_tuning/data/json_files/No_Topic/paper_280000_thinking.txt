To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PePScenes: A Novel Dataset and Baseline for Pedestrian Action Prediction in 3D" by Amir Rasouli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset for pedestrian action prediction, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors mention that their dataset is built upon the existing nuScenes dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context and purpose of their new dataset.

In the **Datasets section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly describe their proposed dataset, which they refer to as **PePScenes**. They explain that this dataset includes additional 2D/3D bounding box and behavioral annotations added to the nuScenes dataset. This section provides essential details about the dataset's purpose and its contents.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the **Related Works section (Section 2)**. The authors reference several existing datasets relevant to pedestrian action prediction, including:

1. **Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD)**: This dataset consists of 346 video clips annotated with 2D bounding boxes for pedestrians and behavioral tags.
2. **Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE)**: This dataset provides ego-vehicle motion parameters and pedestrian intention information.
3. **Trajectory Inference using Targeted Action priors Network (TITAN)**: This dataset includes 2D bounding box and pedestrian behavior annotations.
4. **Stanford-TRI Intent Prediction (STIP)**: Similar to PIE, it provides 2D bounding box and pedestrian behavior annotations.
5. **VIENA2**: A dataset containing simulated video sequences for action anticipation.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further analysis or use.
