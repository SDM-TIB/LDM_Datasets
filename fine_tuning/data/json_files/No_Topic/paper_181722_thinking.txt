To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptual Quality Prediction on Authentically Distorted Images Using a Bag of Features Approach" by Deepti Ghadiyaram and Alan C. Bovik, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "large database of authentically distorted images" and also reference the "LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database." This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of existing databases and mention several legacy databases, including the **LIVE Image Quality Database**, the **TID databases**, and the **CSIQ database**. These are important to note as they may be used for comparison or validation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention using the **LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database** for their experiments. They describe this dataset as containing images captured using various mobile devices and affected by multiple authentic distortions. This is a key dataset for their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References section**. Here are the relevant citations:

4. **CSIQ Database**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
