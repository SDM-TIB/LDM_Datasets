To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Music Information Dynamics" by Shlomo Dubnov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experimental results are likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the field of Music Information Dynamics and mentions generative models that maximize information rate, but does not explicitly name any datasets. I will need to look further into the experimental section for concrete examples.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the author describes the experiments conducted on a MIDI file of the Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C Minor, BWV 847, by J.S. Bach. This indicates that a specific dataset (the MIDI file) is used for the analysis.

The author also mentions that the full rate representation was obtained by training a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on a set of MIDI files from LABROSA. This suggests that LABROSA is another dataset used in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MIDI file of the Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C Minor, BWV 847**, the citation is:
   > Bach, J. S. (n.d.). *Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C Minor, BWV 847*. Retrieved from http://bachwelltemperedclavier.org/pf-c-minor.html

2. For the **LABROSA dataset**, the citation is:
   > LABROSA. (n.d.). *LABROSA: A collection of MIDI files*. Retrieved from https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/piano/

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper:

- **Dataset 1**: MIDI file of the Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C Minor, BWV 847
- **Dataset 2**: LABROSA MIDI files

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
