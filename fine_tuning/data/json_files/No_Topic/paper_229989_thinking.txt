To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Gradient Boosting Network for Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation" by Qing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves superior results on the public dataset **ORIGA**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 3 (Experimental Results)**. Here, the authors state that they validate their method on the **ORIGA dataset**, which contains 650 pairs of fundus images and annotations by experts. This section provides essential details about the dataset's size and purpose.

I will also check the **data preprocessing and augmentation** subsection within the experimental results to gather more information about how the dataset is utilized. This section confirms that the authors used 325 pairs for training and the remaining for testing, and it describes the preprocessing steps taken with the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ORIGA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **ORIGA dataset**:
  > Z. Zhang, F. S. Yin, J. Liu, W. K. Wong, N. M. Tan, B. H. Lee, J. Cheng, and T. Y. Wong, “Origa-light: An online retinal fundus image database for glaucoma analysis and research,” in 2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, 2010, pp. 3065–3068.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ORIGA dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for ORIGA, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
