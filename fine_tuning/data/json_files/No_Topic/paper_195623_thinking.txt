To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Indirect Strategies for Chinese–Spanish Statistical Machine Translation" by Marta R. Costa-jussà et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** (section 4) to locate any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the use of three parallel corpora, which indicates that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of bilingual resources for Chinese-Spanish translation and mention their interest in gathering these resources. This suggests that they will provide details about specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Chinese–Spanish Parallel Corpora)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they are using:

1. **Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (BTEC)**: This corpus contains around 160,000 parallel sentences, but only a subset of 20,000 sentences is actively used for machine translation purposes in the IWSLT evaluation campaign. The full corpus is not freely available.

2. **Holy Bible**: This corpus consists of approximately 28,000 parallel sentences and around 800,000 tokens per language. It is noted for its high translation quality and coverage of modern vocabulary.

3. **United Nations (UN) Multilanguage Corpus**: This is the largest of the three datasets, containing around 3 million tokens per language across six official UN languages, including Chinese and Spanish. It is freely available for research purposes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Basic Traveller Expressions Corpus (BTEC)**, the citation is:
  > Paul, M., Yamamoto, H., Sumita, E., & Nakamura, S. (2009). On the Importance of Pivot Language Selection for Statistical Machine Translation. In HLT-NAACL (Short Papers), pp. 221–224.

- For the **Holy Bible**, the citation is:
  > Chew, P. A., Verzi, S. J., Bauer, T. L., & McClain, J. T. (2006). Evaluation Of The Bible As A Resource For Cross-language Information Retrieval. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Multilingual Language Resources and Interoperability, pp. 68–74.

- For the **United Nations Multilanguage Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Rafalovitch, A., & Dale, R. (2009). United Nations General Assembly Resolutions: A Six-Language Parallel Corpus. In Proc. of the MT Summit XII, pp. 292–299, Ottawa.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
