To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise" by Rishabh Dudeja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, typically labeled as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the identified sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, types, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments. I will also note any references to previous works that describe these datasets.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
