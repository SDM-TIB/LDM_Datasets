To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feasibility Based Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Metric Learning" by Babak Hosseini and Barbara Hammer, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their algorithm using both synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the concept of metric learning and references various applications, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

I will then focus on the **experiments section (section 6)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using both synthetic datasets and real datasets sourced from the UCI repository, as well as the extended Yale face dataset and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets used for evaluation.

In **subsection 6.1 (Synthetic Data)**, the authors describe a synthetic dataset based on a variation of the 2D zebra stripe data. This dataset is important for understanding the performance of their algorithm in a controlled environment.

In **subsection 6.2 (Real Datasets)**, the authors list the real datasets they used, which include:

1. **Zebra Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created for the experiments.
2. **Wine Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI repository.
3. **Balance Dataset**: Another dataset from the UCI repository.
4. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Also sourced from the UCI repository.
5. **Car Evaluation Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI repository.
6. **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI repository.
7. **Hepatitis Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI repository.
8. **Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset from the UCI repository.
9. **Isolet Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI repository.
10. **Extended Yale Face Dataset**: A well-known dataset for face recognition tasks.
11. **MNIST Dataset**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper provides citations for the datasets used, particularly for the UCI datasets and the Yale and MNIST datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Zebra Dataset**: Not a formal dataset with a citation, as it is synthetic.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
