To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking NLI Systems with Sentences that Require Simple Lexical Inferences" by Max Glockner, Vered Shwartz, and Yoav Goldberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and background sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new NLI test set has been created, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Background section**, where the authors discuss existing NLI datasets. They mention three specific datasets:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset consists of 570,000 sentence pairs labeled as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. It is a foundational dataset for NLI tasks.

2. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is similar to SNLI but covers a wider range of genres, allowing for cross-genre evaluation.

3. **SciTail**: This dataset is smaller, containing 27,026 examples, and is focused on science-related questions, labeled only as entailment or neutral.

In the **Data Collection section**, the authors describe their own newly constructed test set, which is designed to evaluate NLI models' ability to make inferences requiring lexical knowledge. This new dataset is significant for the paper's contributions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and D. Christopher Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/D15-1075.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In The 16th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 631–645, 2018.

- For **SciTail**, the citation is:
  > Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal, and Peter Clark. *SciTail: A textual entailment dataset from science question answering*. In The Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 5415–5422, 2018.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for further research or analysis.
