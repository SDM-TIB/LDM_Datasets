To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing and Visualizing Polarization and Balance with Signed Networks: The U.S. Congress Case Study" by Arthur Capozzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on analyzing polarization dynamics in the U.S. Congress, which suggests that there may be datasets related to congressional voting.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4 (Creation of the Congress network)**, where the authors describe the construction of signed networks based on congressional roll call votes. They mention that the data is available from the **Voteview Project**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is being utilized.

In this section, the authors provide details about the data used:
1. **Congressional Roll Call Votes**: This dataset includes voting records from the U.S. Congress from 1945 to 2020. It captures how representatives voted on various issues, allowing for the analysis of polarization dynamics.

The authors also mention the number of unique nodes and edges for both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Voteview Project, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the Voteview Project is:
> Voteview Project. *Voteview: Congressional Roll Call Data*. Available at: https://voteview.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Voteview Project as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
