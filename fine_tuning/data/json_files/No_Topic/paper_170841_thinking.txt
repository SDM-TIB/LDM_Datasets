To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Multifocus Image Fusion Method Using Contourlet Transform" by Fatemeh Vakili Moghadam and Hamid Reza Shahdoosti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their research. If they discuss prior work or methodologies, there may be implicit references to datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section may contain information about the datasets used for testing or training their model.

Following that, I will check the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors detail the datasets they used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or configurations of those datasets.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "MS and PAN images" or "multifocus images," I will look for their respective citations in the references. For example, if the authors refer to the "MS and PAN images," I will find the citation:

- For **MS and PAN images**, the citation is:
  > Shahdoosti, H.R. and Ghassemian, H., 2015. Fusion of MS and PAN images preserving spectral quality. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 12(3), pp.611-615.

If there are additional datasets mentioned, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
