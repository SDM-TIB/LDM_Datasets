To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Common Sense Knowledge, Ontology and Text Mining for Implicit Requirements" by Onyeka Emebo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on implicit requirements and the technologies used, which may hint at the datasets involved. The introduction may also reference any datasets used in the context of common sense knowledge or requirements engineering.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (if available) to look for specific mentions of datasets. These sections often detail the data sources used for experiments or evaluations, which is crucial for identifying datasets.

I will also check the **related work section** for any references to datasets that have been previously used in similar studies. This can provide context and help identify datasets that are relevant to the research.

If the paper includes a **results or evaluation section**, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of performance metrics or comparisons. This is often where authors will specify the datasets they used to validate their findings.

After identifying any datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "WordNet" or "ConceptNet," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. I will ensure to note down the complete citation format as it appears in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data sources utilized in the study.
