To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Newton and Secant Methods for Iterative Remnant Control of Preisach Hysteresis Operators" by J.R. Keulen and B. Jayawardhana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the properties of the remnant function of Preisach hysteresis operators but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors provide any details about datasets used for numerical simulations or validations. In this case, the paper mentions a numerical simulation setup in Section V, where they describe the Preisach operator discretization and the parameters used for the simulations. However, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide specific dataset names, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that might contain datasets relevant to the study. The references include various papers on hysteresis models and control methods, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

Given that the paper primarily focuses on theoretical developments and numerical simulations without referencing specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, if there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract the following information for each dataset:
1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Since no datasets are identified in this paper, I will not create any entries. If I had found datasets, I would compile them into a structured format for further use.
