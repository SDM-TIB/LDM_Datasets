To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monotone Individual Fairness" by Yahav Bechavod, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets indirectly. However, I do not see any specific datasets mentioned in this section either.

I will then move on to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are typically where datasets are explicitly described. In this paper, the relevant sections appear to be **Section 3 (Online Learning with Individual Fairness)** and **Section 4 (Partial Information)**. I will look for any datasets that are referenced or utilized in these sections.

Upon reviewing **Section 3**, I find that the authors discuss their algorithms and the context in which they operate, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to **Section 4**, where they describe their approach to online classification with individual fairness under partial information. Again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Since I have not found any datasets explicitly mentioned in the main sections of the paper, I will check the **References** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. I will look for any references that might indicate datasets used in previous studies or related works.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves. Instead, they are primarily research papers discussing algorithms and methodologies related to fairness in machine learning.

In conclusion, it appears that this paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were identified in the paper "Monotone Individual Fairness" by Yahav Bechavod.

Since I did not find any datasets, there are no citations to provide. However, if I had found datasets, I would have documented them with their full citations as follows:

- For each dataset, I would provide the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation in the format:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

This structured approach ensures that I thoroughly check all relevant sections of the paper and the references for any datasets that may be mentioned.
