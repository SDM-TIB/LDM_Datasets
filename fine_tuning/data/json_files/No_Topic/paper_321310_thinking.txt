To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Dictionary Learning based on Statistical Methods" by G. Madhuri and Atul Negi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions challenges with classification performance on datasets like the **Telugu OCR datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will look for specific sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 7 (UHTelPCC)**, where the authors describe the **UHTelPCC dataset**. This dataset is detailed as containing 70,000 binary connected components of size 32 × 32 pixels from 325 classes, and it is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of experiments or comparisons. In section 7.2, the authors reference the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **UHTelPCC dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Kummari, C. Bhagvati, UHTelPCC: A Dataset for Telugu Printed Character Recognition, in: Recent Trends on Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Vol. 862, 2018, pp. 1–13.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > D. Ciregan, U. Meier, J. Schmidhuber, Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification, in: 2012 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, IEEE, 2012, pp. 3642–3649.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
