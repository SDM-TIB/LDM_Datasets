To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subquadratic Overparameterization for Shallow Neural Networks" by Chaehwan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that could help in identifying them.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like MNIST or any other datasets used for experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper mentions the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
