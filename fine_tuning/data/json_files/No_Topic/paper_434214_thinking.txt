To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Bit and Semantic Communications" by Kaiwen Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a **pluto-based software defined radio (SDR) platform** for experimental validation, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, they mention using the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** for semantic transmission and the **USC-SIPI image dataset** for bit transmission. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **USC-SIPI image dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. G. Weber. *The USC-SIPI Image Database: Version 5*. 2006. Available: http://sipi.usc.edu/database/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
