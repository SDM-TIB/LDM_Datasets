To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tractable Learning and Inference for Large-Scale Probabilistic Boolean Networks" by Ifigeneia Apostolopoulou and Diana Marculescu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the data used for training and testing their models. This section may contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors may provide additional insights into the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets. This section can also confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)" for their experiments, I will look for the appropriate citation format, which typically includes the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis.
