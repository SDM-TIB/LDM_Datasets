To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Large Language Models Replace Economic Choice Prediction Labs?" by Eilam Shapira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of LLM-generated data for predicting human behavior in economic settings, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection section** (Section 4), as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **Human Dataset**: This dataset was collected via a mobile application where human decision-makers interacted with expert bots in a multi-stage game. The dataset contains 71,579 decisions made by 210 distinct human decision-makers, who completed all six stages of the game.

2. **LLM Dataset**: This dataset was generated by replicating the human dataset collection process, but using LLMs instead of human players. It contains 430,610 decisions made by 4,134 LLM-based players, with additional datasets generated for various persona types.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the human dataset, the citation is:
  > Shapira, E., Apel, R., Tennenholtz, M., & Reichart, R. (2023). Human choice prediction in non-cooperative games: Simulation-based off-policy evaluation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.10361.

- The LLM dataset is based on the same methodology as the human dataset, so it does not have a separate citation but is derived from the same study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
