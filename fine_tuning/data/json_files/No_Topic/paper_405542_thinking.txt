To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Advances in Multi-modal 3D Scene Understanding: A Comprehensive Survey and Evaluation" by Yinjie Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the significance of datasets in the context of the research. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are discussed in **Section 5 (Performance Evaluation)**. I will carefully read through this section to identify all datasets mentioned.

From my reading, I note the following datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the most popular benchmarks for 3D object detection and orientation estimation in autonomous driving, comprising over 200,000 annotated point cloud scenarios. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its multi-modal capabilities, including cameras, radars, and LiDARs, containing 1,000 scenes with approximately 40,000 frames. The citation is:
   > Holger Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11 621–11 631, 2020.

3. **SemanticKITTI Dataset**: This dataset is used for 3D semantic segmentation and provides dense point-wise annotations for the complete 360-degree field of view of the employed automotive LiDAR. The citation is:
   > Behley, J., Garbade, M., Milioto, A., Quenzel, J., Behnke, S., Stachniss, C., and Gall, J. *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of LiDAR sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9297–9307, 2019.

4. **ScanRefer Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for 3D visual grounding and dense captioning, containing 51,583 human-written descriptions of objects based on ScanNet scenes. The citation is:
   > Chen, D. Z., Chang, A. X., and Nießner, M. *ScanRefer: 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 202–221, 2020.

5. **ScanQA Dataset**: This dataset is for 3D object-grounded question answering and includes 41,363 questions and 58,191 answers. The citation is:
   > Azuma, D., Miyanishi, T., Kurita, S., and Kawanabe, M. *ScanQA: 3D question answering for spatial scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 19 129–19 139, 2022.

6. **SQA3D Dataset**: This dataset is the largest for grounded 3D scene understanding, comprising 20.4k descriptions and 33.4k questions. The citation is:
   > Ma, X., Yong, S., Zheng, Q., Li, Q., Liang, Y., Zhu, S.-C., and Huang, S. *SQA3D: Situated question answering in 3D scenes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.07474, 2022.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
