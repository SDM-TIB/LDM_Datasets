To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electromagnetic Models for Passive Detection and Localization of Multiple Bodies" by Vittorio Rampa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a multi-body electromagnetic model for passive localization systems, which suggests that there may be datasets related to experiments or simulations conducted to validate this model.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe experiments using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant industrial radio devices, which indicates that there may be datasets related to the Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements taken during these experiments.

I will pay particular attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize experimental results, as these often accompany datasets. For instance, the paper includes a table summarizing average errors and standard deviations in the LOS area, which may imply the existence of a dataset used to derive these statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the collection of RSS data in a large hall using two radio devices. They mention two datasets: one collected in an empty scenario (used to compute reference values) and another collected with two targets present. I will note the details of these datasets, including the conditions under which they were collected.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations will include:

1. **Dataset of RSS measurements in an empty scenario**:
   - This dataset is used to compute reference values for the RSS measurements when no targets are present.

2. **Dataset of RSS measurements with two targets**:
   - This dataset includes measurements taken with two subjects placed at specific locations, which were used to optimize the model parameters.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any papers or sources that provide the original datasets or methodologies used to collect the data. If the datasets are not publicly available, I will note that they are proprietary to the authors' experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its purpose, conditions of collection, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
