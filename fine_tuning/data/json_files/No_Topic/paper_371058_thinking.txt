To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Enhancing Expressive Power via Compositions of Single Fixed-Size ReLU Network" by Shijun Zhang, Jianfeng Lu, and Hongkai Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments" or "Datasets"**. These sections usually contain explicit mentions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

While reading, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. If the paper refers to any datasets without providing full citations, I will check the **References section** to find the original sources for those datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to gather the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After compiling this information, I will format it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation. This will help in maintaining academic integrity and providing proper credit to the original dataset creators.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
