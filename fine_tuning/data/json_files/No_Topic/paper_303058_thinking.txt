To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendations" by Lei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of cold-start users and mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention using four datasets for evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Datasets)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ColdRec-1**: This dataset includes a source domain from a news recommendation dataset collected from QQ Browser, and a target domain from Kandian. The source domain has 1,649,095 instances and 191,022 items, while the target domain has 22,360 instances and 24,643 items.

2. **ColdRec-2**: Similar to ColdRec-1, but with a source dataset containing 100 watching interactions for each user. The source domain has 1,472,428 instances and 645,981 items, while the target domain has 11,349 instances and 340,858 items.

3. **ColdRec-3**: A private dataset where the source domain is also from QQ Browser, and the target domain is an advertisement recommendation dataset. The source domain has 3,798,114 instances and 20,343 items, while the target domain has 162 instances and 1,267,117 items.

4. **ColdRec-4**: The source dataset is collected from Tencent Video, and the target dataset is from Kandian. The source domain has 2,947,688 instances and 17,880 items, while the target domain has 6,288 instances and 1,267,117 items.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets are not typically cited in the same way as academic papers. Instead, the authors provide descriptions and context for the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details, including the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, ensuring that I note the context in which they were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and includes all necessary information for future reference or analysis.
