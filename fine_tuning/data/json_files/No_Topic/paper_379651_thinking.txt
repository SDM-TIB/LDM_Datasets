To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extractive Summarization via ChatGPT for Faithful Summary Generation" by Haopeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates ChatGPT's performance on various benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list four publicly available benchmark datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset is widely used for summarization tasks and consists of news articles paired with corresponding highlights. The authors specify that they used the non-anonymized version and followed standard training/validation/testing splits.

2. **XSum**: This dataset is designed for extreme summarization, containing one-sentence summaries of news articles. The authors mention that they adhered to common splits for this dataset as well.

3. **PubMed**: This dataset is focused on scientific paper summarization, where the introduction section serves as the article and the abstract as the summary. The authors also follow common splits for this dataset.

4. **Reddit**: This dataset is collected from social media and is noted for its highly abstractive nature. The authors provide the splits used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional networks for extreme summarization*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.08745, 2018.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.05685, 2018.

- For **Reddit**, the citation is:
  > Byeongchang Kim, Hyunwoo Kim, and Gunhee Kim. *Abstractive summarization of reddit posts with multi-level memory networks*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00783, 2018.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
