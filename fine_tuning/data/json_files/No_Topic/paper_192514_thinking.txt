To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unweighted Stochastic Local Search can be Effective for Random CSP Benchmarks" by Christopher D. Rosin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific benchmarks or datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author discusses the context and significance of the research. This section often contains references to datasets or benchmarks that are foundational to the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm, ULSA. The author may describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author discusses a benchmark suite of forced-satisfiable Model RB instances, denoted as **frbX-Y**, where X represents the number of variables and Y represents the domain size. This indicates that the paper utilizes a specific set of datasets for its experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The author may reference foundational papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

The relevant datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **frbX-Y Benchmark Suite**: This suite consists of forced-satisfiable instances generated from Model RB, which are widely used in CSP solving competitions. The specific instances mentioned in the experiments include frb40-19, frb45-21, and frb100-40.

To provide full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the original sources that describe the Model RB instances. The citations are as follows:

- For the frbX-Y benchmark suite, the citation is:
  > Xu, K. (2003). Forced satisfiable CSP and SAT benchmarks of Model RB. Available from http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/benchmarks/benchmarks.htm.

- For the BHOSLIB benchmarks, which are also referenced in the paper, the citation is:
  > Xu, K. (2005). BHOSLIB: Benchmarks with hidden optimum solutions for graph problems. Available from http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/benchmarks/graph-benchmarks.htm.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
