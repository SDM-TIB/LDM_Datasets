To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic bony structure segmentation and curvature estimation on ultrasound cervical spine images - a feasibility study" by Songhan Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or validation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or data collection methods. The authors discuss the use of ultrasound imaging for assessing cervical spine deformities, which suggests that they may have collected their own dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **data acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors describe the collection of **29 ultrasound scans** from **12 volunteers**. This indicates that the dataset consists of these scans, which are crucial for the study's analysis.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional details about the dataset, such as the number of images used for training and testing the nnU-Net model. The authors mention using **1,977 two-dimensional transverse ultrasound images for training** and **548 for testing**, which provides further clarity on the dataset composition.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the collection of ultrasound scans, which does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets, but I can summarize it as follows:

- **Ultrasound Scans Dataset**: This dataset consists of 29 ultrasound scans collected from 12 volunteers (10 males and 2 females) to assess cervical spine curvature. The scans were acquired using a portable ultrasound imaging system and included various postures.

Since this dataset is unique to the study and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors for their research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and details about the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I highlight the key aspects of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and the context in which it was collected.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset as described in the paper.
