To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking Turbulence Through Financial News During COVID-19" by Philip Hossu and Natalie Parde, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a set of expert annotations of financial sentiment for articles, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on this by stating that they collected expert annotations for 800 financial article titles and descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **Data Sources** section, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **FIN-COV-NEWS**: This dataset consists of financial articles collected using the NewsFilter.IO API, containing 192,154 articles from major American financial publishers. The dataset is described in detail, including its structure and the types of information it contains.

2. **SEMEVAL-2017 Dataset**: The authors sampled 750 random articles from this dataset, which was created for sentiment analysis tasks. They mention using cutoff points to categorize sentiment labels.

3. **Financial Phrase Bank (FINPHRASEBANK)**: Another dataset mentioned is the Financial Phrase Bank, from which they sampled 750 random phrases, specifically from the "AllAgree" subset to ensure high-quality training data.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FIN-COV-NEWS**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as:

- For the **SEMEVAL-2017 Dataset**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
