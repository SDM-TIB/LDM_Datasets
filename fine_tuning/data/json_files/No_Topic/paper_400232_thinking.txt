To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Vision and Language through Graphs of Events in Space and Time" by Mihai Masala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the Graph of Events in Space and Time (GEST) and its applications, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the limitations of current models in bridging vision and language but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any experimental setups or evaluations that might mention datasets. In section 2.1, the authors mention using the **Videos-to-Paragraphs dataset** for their experiments, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the Videos-to-Paragraphs dataset and gather more details about it. The authors describe how they build ground truth GEST representations from the dataset, indicating its significance in their research.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Videos-to-Paragraphs dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Simion-Vlad Bogolin, Ioana Croitoru, and Marius Leordeanu. *A hierarchical approach to vision-based language generation: from simple sentences to complex natural language*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 2436â€“2447, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Videos-to-Paragraphs Dataset**: This dataset is used for text-to-text comparisons in the context of video generation and is crucial for building ground truth GEST representations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
