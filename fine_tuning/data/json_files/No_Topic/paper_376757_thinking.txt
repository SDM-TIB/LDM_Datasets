To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breast Cancer Histopathology Image-Based Gene Expression Prediction Using Spatial Transcriptomics Data and Deep Learning" by Md Mamunur Rahaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting gene expression from histopathology images using spatial transcriptomics data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer and the potential of spatial transcriptomics technologies. However, I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the methods section.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention using the fifth edition of a publicly accessible spatial transcriptomics dataset, which consists of 68 whole slide images (WSIs) from 23 breast cancer patients. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the types of breast cancer subtypes represented, the scanning magnification, image size, and the number of spots and gene expression counts.

The authors also reference the dataset in the context of their methodology, confirming its use in their experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the spatial transcriptomics dataset is:

- **Spatial Transcriptomics Dataset**: 
  > Linnea Stenbeck et al. *Human breast cancer in situ capturing transcriptomics*. Mendeley Data, 5, 2021.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Spatial Transcriptomics Dataset**: This dataset includes 68 WSIs of H&E-stained frozen tissue sections from 23 breast cancer patients with various subtypes. Each section is scanned at 20× magnification, with an image size of approximately 9,500 × 9,500 pixels, containing around 450 spots per section, and a total of 30,612 spots with gene expression counts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
