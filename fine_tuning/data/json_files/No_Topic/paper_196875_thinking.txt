To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving OSCAR regularization problems by proximal splitting algorithms" by Xiangrong Zeng and MÃ¡rio A. T. Figueiredo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the OSCAR regularizer and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, which discusses the context and relevance of the OSCAR regularizer in various fields. However, it does not specify any datasets used for experiments.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they detail the experimental setup, including the original signal structure and the sensing matrix A, but they do not refer to any publicly available datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methods rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in this research paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper and provide a note indicating the absence of dataset citations.
