To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How NOT To Evaluate Your Dialogue System: An Empirical Study of Unsupervised Evaluation Metrics for Dialogue Response Generation" by Chia-Wei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of dialogue response generation systems and mentions two specific datasets: the **Twitter dataset** and the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly mention both datasets and provide context about their use in evaluating the performance of various dialogue response generation models.

1. **Twitter Dataset**: The paper states that the Twitter dataset is used to evaluate the correlation between automatic metrics and human judgments in a non-technical dialogue context. It is important to note that this dataset is derived from Twitter conversations, which are characterized by informal language and diverse responses.

2. **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as a technical dialogue corpus used for evaluating dialogue systems in a more structured and technical context. The authors highlight that this corpus contains conversations focused on technical support and problem-solving.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ritter, A., Cherry, C., & Dolan, B. (2010). Unsupervised modeling of Twitter conversations. In North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL).

- For the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R., Pow, N., Serban, I. V., & Pineau, J. (2015). The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems. In SIGDIAL.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
