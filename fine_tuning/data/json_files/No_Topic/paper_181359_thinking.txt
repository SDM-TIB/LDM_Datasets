To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical and Computational Trade-offs in Estimation of Sparse Principal Components" by Tengyao Wang, Quentin Berthet, and Richard J. Samworth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets when discussing their findings. This is often where datasets are explicitly named, especially if they are critical to the experiments conducted.

I will also check the **experiments section** (if available) for detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant information about how they were collected or processed.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for the full citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in other literature or online databases.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
