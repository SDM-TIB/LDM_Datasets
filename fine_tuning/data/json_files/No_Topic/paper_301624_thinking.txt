To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minibatch and Momentum Model-based Methods for Stochastic Weakly Convex Optimization" by Qi Deng and Wenzhi Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their work. If they reference any datasets, I will look for details about their characteristics or sources.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for testing their methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for the original paper that introduced the MNIST dataset to provide a complete citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
