To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs" by Sudhir Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a dataset containing single goal and multi-goal complete and incomplete natural language queries based on a set of APIs. This suggests that there is a dataset relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors describe the dataset generation process in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where they mention using GPT-4 to generate user queries that represent single goal tasks executable via a subset of APIs. They also mention that they manually reviewed and annotated the generated queries with ground truth values for the APIs and entities.

The specific dataset mentioned is a generated dataset containing natural language user queries related to various topics such as profit & loss reports, invoice creation, and how-to help requests. The authors state that they generated this dataset to evaluate their approach, which is a key point for documentation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves and does not reference an external source, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on queries generated using GPT-4 and is annotated by the authors.

I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Generated Dataset for User Queries
   - **Description**: A dataset containing single goal and multi-goal complete and incomplete natural language queries based on a set of APIs. The dataset was generated using GPT-4 and includes queries related to various topics such as profit & loss reports, invoice creation, and how-to help requests. The queries were manually reviewed and annotated with ground truth values for the APIs and entities.
   - **Citation**: No formal citation available as the dataset is generated by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
