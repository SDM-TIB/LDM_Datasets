To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probability-based Global Cross-modal Upsampling for Pansharpening" by Zeyu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for their experiments: **WordView2**, **WordView3**, and **GaoFen2**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of training and testing samples, the dimensions of the images, and the types of images (PAN, LRMS, HRMS).

From the information provided in **Table 1**, I can extract the following details:

1. **WordView2**: 
   - Train/Test Split: 768/80
   - PAN Image Size: 128×128
   - LRMS Image Size: 32×32×4
   - HRMS Image Size: 128×128×4

2. **WordView3**: 
   - Train/Test Split: 2160/208
   - PAN Image Size: 128×128
   - LRMS Image Size: 32×32×4
   - HRMS Image Size: 128×128×4

3. **GaoFen2**: 
   - Train/Test Split: 2720/208
   - PAN Image Size: 128×128
   - LRMS Image Size: 32×32×4
   - HRMS Image Size: 128×128×4

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are derived from satellite imagery and may not have specific papers associated with them. In such cases, I will note that the datasets are commonly used in remote sensing and may be referenced in other works.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the relevant details and any citations if available. If no specific citations are found for the datasets, I will indicate that they are standard datasets in the field of remote sensing.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
