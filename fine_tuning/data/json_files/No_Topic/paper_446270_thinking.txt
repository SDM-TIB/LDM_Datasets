To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid X-Linker: Automated Data Generation and Extreme Multi-label Ranking for Biomedical Entity Linking" by Pedro Ruas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on several biomedical datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of entity linking in the biomedical domain and reference the need for large-scale datasets. This suggests that they will provide specific dataset names later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where they describe the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention several datasets: **BC5CDR-Disease, BioRED-Disease, NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR-Chemical, BioRED-Chemical, and NLM-Chem**. I will note these down as they are explicitly stated.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table II) that summarizes the evaluation datasets, including the total number of instances and the number of NIL and obsolete annotations. This table confirms the datasets mentioned earlier and provides additional context about their sizes and characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **BC5CDR Dataset**:
   > Li, J., Sun, Y., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., Wei, C.-H., Leaman, R., Mattingly, C. J., Wiegers, T. C., & Lu, Z. (2016). Biocreative v cdr task corpus: A resource for chemical disease relation extraction. *Database*, 2016.

2. **BioRED Dataset**:
   > Luo, L., Lai, P.-T., Wei, C.-H., Arighi, C. N., & Lu, Z. (2022). BioRED: A rich biomedical relation extraction dataset. *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 23(5), bbac282.

3. **NCBI-Disease Dataset**:
   > DoÄŸan, R. I., Leaman, R., & Lu, Z. (2014). NCBI disease corpus: A resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 47, 1-10.

4. **BC5CDR-Chemical Dataset**:
   > Li, J., Sun, Y., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., Wei, C.-H., Leaman, R., Mattingly, C. J., Wiegers, T. C., & Lu, Z. (2016). Biocreative v cdr task corpus: A resource for chemical disease relation extraction. *Database*, 2016.

5. **BioRED-Chemical Dataset**:
   > Luo, L., Lai, P.-T., Wei, C.-H., Arighi, C. N., & Lu, Z. (2022). BioRED: A rich biomedical relation extraction dataset. *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 23(5), bbac282.

6. **NLM-Chem Dataset**:
   > Islamaj, R., Leaman, R., Kim, S., Kwon, D., Wei, C.-H., Comeau, D. C., Peng, Y., Cissel, D., Coss, C., Fisher, C., Guzman, R., Kochar, P. G., Koppel, S., Trinh, D., Sekiya, K., Ward, J., Whitman, D., Schmidt, S., & Lu, Z. (2021). NLM-Chem, a new resource for chemical entity recognition in PubMed full text literature. *Scientific Data*, 8(1), 91.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
