To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Bandwidth Communication Emerges Naturally in Multi-Agent Learning Systems" by Niko A. Grupen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections where datasets are more likely to be detailed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and mention the use of **pursuit-evasion games** as a framework for their experiments. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **experimental setup** and **training details** subsections. Here, the authors describe the pursuit-evasion game environment and the algorithms used, but they do not reference any external datasets. Instead, they mention that they modified an existing environment introduced by Lowe et al. This indicates that the dataset or environment they are using is based on prior work rather than a new dataset.

To confirm this, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or environments. The authors cite a paper by Lowe et al. regarding the pursuit-evasion environment, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments. The citation is as follows:

- For the pursuit-evasion environment, the citation is:
  > Ryan Lowe, Yi I Wu, Aviv Tamar, Jean Harb, OpenAI, Pieter Abbeel, and Igor Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 6379â€“6390, 2017.

Since the paper does not introduce any new datasets but rather utilizes an existing environment, I will summarize the findings related to the experimental setup without creating dataset entries in the specified JSON format.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of a modified pursuit-evasion environment, it does not provide new datasets. The key reference for the environment used in their experiments is the work by Lowe et al. I will ensure to document this citation accurately for any future reference.
