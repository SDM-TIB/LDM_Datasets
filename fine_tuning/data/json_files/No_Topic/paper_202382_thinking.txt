To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependency-based Hybrid Trees for Semantic Parsing" by Zhanming Jie and Wei Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **GeoQuery dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **GeoQuery dataset**. I will gather more details about this dataset, such as its characteristics and the languages it covers.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if there are any other datasets mentioned or referenced. However, it seems that the focus remains on the GeoQuery dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the GeoQuery dataset. The original citation for the GeoQuery dataset is:

- **GeoQuery Dataset**:
  > Zelle, J. M., & Mooney, R. J. (1996). Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming. In Proceedings of AAAI.

After confirming that the GeoQuery dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. 

I will ensure that the dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset: GeoQuery
- A brief description: A dataset consisting of natural language queries and their corresponding logical forms, annotated in multiple languages.
- The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included and accurately represented.
