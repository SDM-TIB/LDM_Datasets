To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Unconstrained Videos" by Wenke Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on two datasets:

1. **UCF51 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of visual action recognition and video retrieval tasks. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its size and the types of activities it covers.

2. **ActivityNet Dataset**: Similar to UCF51, this dataset is also mentioned for the same tasks. I will gather information about its characteristics and the number of classes or activities it includes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution. 

For the **UCF51 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

For the **ActivityNet Dataset**, the citation is:
> Bernard Ghanem, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for further processing or review.
