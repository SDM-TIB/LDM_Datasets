To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Difficulty Modelling in Mobile Puzzle Games: An Empirical Study on Different Methods to Combine Player Analytics and Simulated Data" by Jeppe Theiss Kristensen and Paolo Burelli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of player analytics and simulated data for difficulty estimation, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the game "Lily's Garden" as a case study for their research. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used, including player data and agent data.

In **Section 5 (Data)**, the authors categorize the data into four types: historic data, player data, level data, and agent data. They provide a detailed description of each category, which indicates that they are using specific datasets for their analysis. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets.

The paper mentions that the data used in the study consists of the number of attempts each player has spent on a given level, recorded over a specific time frame. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference previous works and methodologies that may have used similar datasets or provided foundational data for their study.

1. **Lily's Garden Dataset**: This dataset consists of player attempts on levels in the game "Lily's Garden," recorded between June 1, 2021, and December 1, 2021. It includes data from players who started during this period and played at least 200 levels.

2. **Agent Data**: The authors describe the use of a reinforcement learning agent to simulate player behavior and collect data on level dynamics. This data is crucial for understanding the intrinsic difficulty of levels.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
