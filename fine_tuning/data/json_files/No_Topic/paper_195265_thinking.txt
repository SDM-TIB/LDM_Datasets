To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximation Models of Combat in StarCraft 2" by Ian Helmke, Daniel Kreymer, and Karl Wiegand, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of StarCraft 2 and the need for AI combat strategies, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **method section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup.

In the **method section**, they mention that they built 12 customized StarCraft 2 maps for their experiments, which represent matches between two opposing armies of different races. This indicates that the experimental results are based on these maps, but I need to confirm if these maps or any specific datasets are formally cited.

Next, I will look at the **results section**, where they summarize the experimental results of each match. They provide detailed comparisons of the outcomes of battles between different army compositions, but again, there is no explicit mention of a dataset with a formal citation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets or resources are cited. The references include various articles and resources related to StarCraft 2, but they do not specifically cite a dataset that was used in the experiments.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that while the authors conducted experiments using custom maps and recorded results, they did not reference any publicly available datasets or external datasets in their work. Instead, the data generated from their experiments is based on their own simulations within the StarCraft 2 engine.

Since there are no specific datasets to extract with full citations, I will summarize the findings based on the experimental results they provided, noting that the data is derived from their own custom simulations rather than an external dataset.

In conclusion, I will document that the authors created their own experimental data through simulations in StarCraft 2, but no formal datasets with citations were provided in the paper.
