To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme View Synthesis" by Inchang Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a method for novel view synthesis and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This suggests that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their method and its evaluation, which often includes specific datasets used for testing.

Upon examining the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **MVS-Synth dataset** for training their reﬁnement network. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MVS-Synth dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Po-Han Huang, Kevin Matzen, Johannes Kopf, Narendra Ahuja, and Jia-Bin Huang. *DeepMVS: Learning multi-view stereopsis*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors may refer to other datasets in the context of related work or comparisons. For instance, they reference the **Stereo Magnification (SM)** method by Zhou et al., which implies the use of datasets associated with that work.

I will also check the references for the full citation of the SM method:
> Tinghui Zhou, Richard Tucker, John Flynn, Graham Fyffe, and Noah Snavely. *Stereo Magnification: Learning view synthesis using multiplane images*. In ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH), 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
