To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On a Benefit of Mask Language Modeling: Robustness to Simplicity Bias" by Ting-Rui Chiang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author discusses the datasets used for the hate speech detection and named entity recognition (NER) tasks. Here, the author mentions specific datasets and their characteristics, which are crucial for my extraction.

In **Section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, the author describes the datasets used for the hate speech detection task and the NER task:

1. **Hate Speech Detection Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the work of Zhou et al. (2021), where the authors created a dataset focusing on instances containing non-offensive minority identity (NOI) mentions. The dataset consists of positive samples that are all the positive samples in the original dataset containing NOI, and negative samples randomly sampled from the original training set.

2. **NER Dataset**: The standard NER dataset used is the CoNLL-2003 dataset, as referenced by Tjong Kim Sang & De Meulder (2003). The author also mentions that they created a testing set with unseen name entities by replacing the name entities in the original validation and testing splits with entities from the WNUT-17 dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Hate Speech Detection Dataset**, the citation is:

URL https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4418.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
