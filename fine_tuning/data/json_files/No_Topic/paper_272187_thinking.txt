To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ordering the smallest claim amounts from two sets of interdependent heterogeneous portfolios" by Hossein Nadeb, Hamzeh Torabi, and Ali Dolati, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets or models used for analysis.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss the models and examples. I will look for any explicit references to datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors discuss various models and theoretical concepts, but they also provide numerical examples to illustrate their findings. I will pay close attention to these examples, as they often include specific datasets or simulated data that are crucial for understanding the results.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "Lomax-exponential distribution" or any other statistical model, I will ensure to find the original source or relevant literature that describes this dataset in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
