To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotation-cost Minimization for Medical Image Segmentation using Suggestive Mixed Supervision" by Yash S. Bhalgat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a framework for medical image segmentation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, especially since the context is medical imaging.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining high-quality annotations for medical images and mention the use of various forms of supervision. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **results section**, where the authors explicitly mention using the **JSRT database**. They describe it as containing 247 high-resolution chest radiographs, each with expert segmentations, landmark annotations, and bounding boxes covering anatomical structures. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the JSRT database. The citation provided in the references is:

> Junji Shiraishi, Shigehiko Katsuragawa, Junpei Ikezoe, and Tsuneo Matsumoto. *Development of a digital image database for chest radiographs with and without a lung nodule*. American Journal of Roentgenology, 174(1):71â€“74, 2000.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the JSRT database, including its description and citation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that the full citation is included as it is crucial for proper referencing. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
