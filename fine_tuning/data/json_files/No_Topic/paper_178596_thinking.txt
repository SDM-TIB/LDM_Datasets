To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multivariate Confidence Intervals" by Jussi Korpela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **Artificial Data**: The authors describe using artificial multivariate datasets sampled from various distributions (uniform, normal, and Cauchy) to study theoretical properties of multivariate confidence areas.

2. **Ozone Dataset**: This dataset is used to compute confidence areas for bootstrapped kernel regression estimates. The authors reference the dataset as being well-known in the context of regression analysis.

3. **South African Heart Disease Dataset**: Similar to the Ozone dataset, this dataset is utilized for computing confidence areas in the context of kernel regression.

4. **Stock Market Data**: The authors mention using daily closing prices of 400 stocks from 2011 to 2015, which they normalize to reflect changes in stock prices.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Ozone Dataset** and **South African Heart Disease Dataset**, I will look for their original sources or any relevant publications that describe these datasets in detail. 

For the **Stock Market Data**, I will note that the data was obtained from daily closing prices, but I will also seek to find a citation or source that provides more context or details about the dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper credit to the original sources.
