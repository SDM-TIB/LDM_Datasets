To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Importance Weighted Transfer of Samples in Reinforcement Learning" by Andrea Tirinzoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the transfer of experience samples in reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets, such as **section 7 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will pay attention to any mentions of specific datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe three different domains: **Puddle World**, **Acrobot**, and **Water Reservoir Control**. Each of these domains likely has associated datasets. I will extract the relevant details for each:

1. **Puddle World**: The authors mention using datasets generated from three source tasks, each consisting of 20 episodes. I will note the specifics of these datasets, including their structure and purpose.

2. **Acrobot**: The authors describe collecting episodes from two source tasks, detailing the number of episodes and the nature of the tasks. I will extract this information to document the datasets used.

3. **Water Reservoir Control**: The authors mention collecting 10,800 samples from six source water reservoirs. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they relate to the target task.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors reference datasets from previous works, I will ensure to include those citations in my documentation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
