To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding the Active Inference Landscape: More Intrinsic Motivations in the Perception-Action Loop" by Martin Biehl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the research, including any datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." Here, the authors may provide information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets in the context of the results obtained. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their significance in the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, as these will serve as the authoritative sources for citation.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets from the paper accurately and comprehensively.
