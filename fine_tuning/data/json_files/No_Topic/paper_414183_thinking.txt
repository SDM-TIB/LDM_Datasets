To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Model Meets New Normals: Test-Time Adaptation for Unsupervised Time-Series Anomaly Detection" by Dongmin Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly focusing on the **datasets subsection**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. I will note down the names and key characteristics of each dataset mentioned.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **SWaT (Secure Water Treatment)**: This dataset consists of measurements collected from a water treatment testbed, covering 11 days of operation with 51 sensors. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mathur, A. P., & Tippenhauer, N. O. (2016). SWaT: A water treatment testbed for research and training on ICS security. In *2016 International Workshop on Cyber-physical Systems for Smart Water Networks, CySWater@CPSWeek 2016*.

2. **WADI (Water Distribution)**: This dataset includes data from a water distribution system, covering 16 days with 123 sensors. The citation is the same as for SWaT:
   > Mathur, A. P., & Tippenhauer, N. O. (2016). SWaT: A water treatment testbed for research and training on ICS security. In *2016 International Workshop on Cyber-physical Systems for Smart Water Networks, CySWater@CPSWeek 2016*.

3. **SMD (Server Machine Dataset)**: This dataset consists of data from 28 distinct server machines over five weeks. The citation is:
   > Su, Y., Zhao, Y., Niu, C., Liu, R., Sun, W., & Pei, D. (2019). Robust Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series through Stochastic Recurrent Neural Network. In *Proc. the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)*.

4. **SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)** and **MSL (Mars Science Laboratory)**: These datasets are derived from spacecraft monitoring systems. The citation for both is:
   > Hundman, K., Constantinou, V., Laporte, C., Colwell, I., & Söderström, T. (2018). Detecting Spacecraft Anomalies Using LSTMs and Nonparametric Dynamic Thresholding. In *Proc. the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)*.

5. **CreditCard**: This dataset consists of transaction logs of European cardholders. The citation is:
   > [Kaggle Dataset]. (n.d.). Credit Card Fraud Detection. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

6. **Yahoo**: This dataset includes both real and synthetic time-series data for anomaly detection. The citation is:
   > Yahoo. (n.d.). Yahoo Anomaly Detection Dataset. Retrieved from https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, including the number of features and the context in which each dataset was used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
