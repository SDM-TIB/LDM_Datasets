To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Evaluation on Multi-channel Biometric Face Presentation Attack Detection" by Anjith George et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a comprehensive study using a multi-channel PAD dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The HQ-WMCA Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention the **High-Quality Wide Multi-Channel Attack (HQ-WMCA)** dataset, which is publicly available and contains a variety of attacks collected with multiple imaging modalities.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the types of attacks (2D, 3D, and partial attacks) and the various channels (RGB, NIR, SWIR, thermal, and depth) included in the dataset. They also mention the total number of images and the distribution of bona fide samples and attacks across different protocols.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HQ-WMCA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Zohreh Mostaani, Anjith George, David Geissbühler, and Sébastien Marcel. *The High-Quality Wide Multi-Channel Attack (HQ-WMCA) Database*. Idiap Research Institute, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **HQ-WMCA Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of multi-channel PAD systems. It includes a wide variety of attacks and data collected from 14 distinct imaging modalities.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
