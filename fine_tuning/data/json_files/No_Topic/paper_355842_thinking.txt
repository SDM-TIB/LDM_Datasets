To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Conversational Interaction with Mobile UI using Large Language Models" by Bryan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using open-source Android UI datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In the text, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **RICO Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for conducting experiments related to mobile UI tasks. It is known for containing a large number of mobile app screens.

2. **Screen2Words Dataset**: This dataset is used for the screen summarization task. It contains human-labeled summaries for a significant number of mobile UI screens.

3. **PixelHelp Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for mapping natural language instructions to UI actions. It includes multi-step instructions for performing tasks on Google Pixel phones.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **RICO Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Screen2Words Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **PixelHelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang Li, Jiacong He, Xin Zhou, Yuan Zhang, and Jason Baldridge. *Mapping Natural Language Instructions to Mobile UI Action Sequences*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are documented correctly for future reference or analysis.
