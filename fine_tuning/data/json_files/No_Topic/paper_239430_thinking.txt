To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Düzlemsel Olmayan Alanların Tarama Yöntemleri" by Çağlar Seylan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the importance of area coverage with unmanned vehicles, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the performance of these vehicles in various terrains.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors may provide context or mention specific datasets used in their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experiments that involve data collection.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of experiments or simulations that involve specific datasets. The authors might describe the types of terrains or scenarios they tested, which could indicate the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets. This will help confirm the relevance and application of the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that the authors reference. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to:
1. **Terrain types** used in the experiments.
2. **Simulation parameters** or any specific datasets that were generated or utilized during the research.

Once I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that I follow the appropriate citation format as seen in the references of the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset.
