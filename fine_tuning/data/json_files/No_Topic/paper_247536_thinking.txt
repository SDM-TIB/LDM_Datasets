To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ocean: Object-aware Anchor-free Tracking" by Zhipeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors evaluate their method on five benchmark datasets. I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets and any relevant details about them.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **VOT-2018**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, and it is noted that it contains 60 sequences for tracking evaluation.
2. **VOT-2019**: This dataset is mentioned as a follow-up to VOT-2018, developed by replacing the least challenging videos from the previous dataset.
3. **OTB-100**: This is described as a standardized benchmark consisting of 100 videos for tracking performance evaluation.
4. **GOT-10k**: This dataset is highlighted as a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 videos, used for tracking evaluation.
5. **LaSOT**: This dataset is noted for having longer sequences, with an average of 2,500 frames per sequence, and is used for evaluating tracking performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **VOT-2018**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, M., Leonardis, A., Matas, et al. *The sixth visual object tracking vot2018 challenge results*. In: ECCVW, pp. 1–52, 2018.

- For **VOT-2019**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, M., Matas, et al. *The seventh visual object tracking vot2019 challenge results*. In: ICCVW, pp. 1–36, 2019.

- For **OTB-100**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Lim, et al. *Object tracking benchmark*. TPAMI 37(9), 1834–1848, 2015.

- For **GOT-10k**, the citation is:
  > Huang, L., Zhao, X., Huang, K. *Got-10k: A large high-diversity benchmark for generic object tracking in the wild*. TPAMI 1(1), 117, 2019.

- For **LaSOT**, the citation is:
  > Fan, H., Lin, L., Yang, F., et al. *LaSOT: A high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking*. In: CVPR, pp. 5374–5383, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
