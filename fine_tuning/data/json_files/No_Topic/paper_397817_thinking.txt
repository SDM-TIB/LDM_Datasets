To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-learning for model-reference data-driven control" by Riccardo Busetto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a novel approach that leverages data from similar plants, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets or types of data used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Then, I will focus on the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Data Collection," "Datasets," or similar headings. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical analyses or experiments that reference specific datasets.

In the **results** section, the authors may discuss the performance of their method using the datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets may include:

1. **Meta-dataset**: The authors mention a meta-dataset comprising open-loop data from similar systems, which is central to their approach. I will need to describe this dataset and provide a citation if available.

2. **Data from meta-motors**: The paper discusses data collected from multiple instances of brushless DC motors. I will look for specific references to these datasets and their sources.

3. **Closed-loop data**: The authors mention closed-loop tests conducted with the controllers. I will check if they provide specific datasets or references for these experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
