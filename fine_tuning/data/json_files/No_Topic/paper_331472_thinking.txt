To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Suitability of Different Metric Choices for Concept Drift Detection" by Fabian Hinder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of drift detection but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of concept drift but also does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. Here, I find a list of datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Rotating hyperplane (RHP)**: This dataset is commonly used for testing drift detection algorithms.
2. **SEA**: Another well-known dataset for evaluating concept drift detection methods.
3. **RandomRBF (rbf)**: A synthetic dataset designed for testing.
4. **Electricity Market Prices (elec)**: A real-world dataset used for drift detection in time series.
5. **Forest Covertype (cover)**: A dataset used for classification tasks, which may also exhibit concept drift.
6. **Nebraska Weather (weather)**: A dataset that can be used to analyze drift in environmental data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
