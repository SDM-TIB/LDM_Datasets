To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly Detection in Bitcoin Network Using Unsupervised Learning Methods" by Thai T. Pham and Steven Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on anomaly detection in the Bitcoin transaction network, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the nature of anomalies in financial networks and specifically mention the Bitcoin transaction network. They indicate that they are using data from this network, which hints at the presence of a dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection **2.1 (Data Collection and Parsing)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they use a Bitcoin transaction dataset obtained from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. They describe the dataset as containing all Bitcoin transactions from the network's inception until April 7, 2013, with a total of 6,336,769 users and 37,450,461 transactions. This section provides crucial details about the dataset.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the analysis of the Bitcoin dataset, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Bitcoin dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference their own previous work, which may include relevant information. The relevant citation from the references is:

- Pham, T. and Lee, S. (2016). *Anomaly Detection in the Bitcoin System - A Network Perspective*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03942.

Since the dataset is derived from the Bitcoin transaction network, I will also include a general citation for Bitcoin as a source of the data:

- Nakamoto, S. (2008). *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Bitcoin Transaction Dataset**: This dataset contains all Bitcoin transactions from the network's creation until April 7, 2013, with 6,336,769 users and 37,450,461 transactions.

The full citation for the dataset is:
- Pham, T. and Lee, S. (2016). *Anomaly Detection in the Bitcoin System - A Network Perspective*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03942.

Additionally, I will note the general citation for Bitcoin:
- Nakamoto, S. (2008). *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
