To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STROBE: Streaming Object Detection from LiDAR Packets" by Davi Frossard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions a "large scale real-world dataset," which indicates that a dataset is involved, prompting me to look for its name and details.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of processing LiDAR data and introduce their method, STROBE. They mention the need for a dataset that provides packet-level data, which suggests that the dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly state that they collected a new dataset called **PACKETATG4D**. They describe it as containing 6500 snippets with diverse conditions, including accurate ego-pose and object bounding box annotations at a temporal resolution of 100Hz. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its size and the types of annotations available.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the PACKETATG4D dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper and does not have an external citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors.

The details I have gathered about the dataset are as follows:

1. **PACKETATG4D**: A novel dataset for evaluating streaming object detection from LiDAR packets. It contains 6500 snippets with diverse conditions, accurate ego-pose, and object bounding box annotations at 100Hz.

Since there are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about PACKETATG4D into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, documented its details, and noted that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors without an external citation.
