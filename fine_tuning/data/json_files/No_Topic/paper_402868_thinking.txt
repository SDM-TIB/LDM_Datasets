To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WAIT: Feature Warping for Animation to Illustration video Translation using GANs" by Samet Hicsonmez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors show the effectiveness of their method on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention two main datasets based on illustrators: **Beatrix Potter (BP)** and **Axel Scheffler (AS)**, along with a third dataset, **Flowers**. 

The paper provides specific details about each dataset, including the number of frames in both the source (animation) and target (illustration) domains. Here are the key details I will extract:

1. **Beatrix Potter (BP) Dataset**:
   - Source: Contains frames from the "Peter Rabbit" animation movie.
   - Target: Illustrations from Beatrix Potter's books.
   - Training frames: 5,560 (source), 489 (target).
   - Testing frames: 1,367 (source), 20 (target).

2. **Axel Scheffler (AS) Dataset**:
   - Source: Contains frames from multiple animation movies including "The Gruffalo" and "Zog".
   - Target: Illustrations from Axel Scheffler's books.
   - Training frames: 9,854 (source), 551 (target).
   - Testing frames: 1,475 (source), 20 (target).

3. **Flowers Dataset**:
   - Source: Time-lapse videos of blooming flowers (Dandelion subset).
   - Target: Images of flowers.
   - Training frames: 2,067 (source), 3,279 (target).
   - Testing frames: 700 (source), 1,100 (target).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For the **Beatrix Potter** and **Axel Scheffler** datasets, the authors refer to their own previous work, which is:
  > Hicsonmez, S., Samet, N., Akbas, E., & Duygulu, P. (2020). Ganilla: Generative adversarial networks for image to illustration translation. *Image and Vision Computing*, 100, 103-113.

- For the **Flowers dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bansal, A., Ma, S., Ramanan, D., & Sheikh, Y. (2018). Recycle-gan: Unsupervised video retargeting. In *Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 119-135.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
