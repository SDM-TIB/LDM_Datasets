To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On a Functional Definition of Intelligence" by Warisa Sritriratanarak and Paulo Garcia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets or data sources. The abstract does not mention any datasets, but it sets the stage for the discussion on intelligence, which may lead to references in later sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the philosophical and theoretical aspects of intelligence but does not specify any datasets used in the research.

Moving on to the **Materials and Methods section**, I will look for any explicit references to datasets. This section primarily outlines the argumentative methodology and does not provide any dataset information.

I will also check the **Results and Discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for their arguments or analyses. However, the paper focuses on theoretical definitions and does not present empirical data or datasets.

Finally, I will review the **Data Availability section**, which states that there is "No data to report for this work." This confirms that the authors did not utilize any datasets in their research.

Since no datasets are mentioned or utilized in this paper, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations. The focus of the paper is on defining intelligence rather than on empirical research involving datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that there are no datasets extracted from this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
