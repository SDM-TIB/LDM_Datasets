To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Modal Compression: Towards Human-comprehensible Semantic Compression" by Jiguo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 5 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluating their proposed model:

1. **MS COCO**: This dataset contains 82,783 training images and 40,504 testing images, with at least 5 captions for each image. The images are resized to a resolution of 256x256 for the experiments.

2. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 8,855 training images and 2,933 testing images, with 10 captions for each image. It includes 200 classes, which are split into 160 for training and 40 for testing. The images are cropped based on annotated bounding boxes and resized to 256x256.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any research-related tasks.
