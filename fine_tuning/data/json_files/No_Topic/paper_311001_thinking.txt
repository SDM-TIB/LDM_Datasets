To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L1-regularized neural ranking for risk stratification and its application to prediction of time to distant metastasis in luminal node negative chemotherapy na√Øve breast cancer patients" by Fayyaz Minhas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes a cohort of **728 Stage-1, luminal (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer patients**. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset and Data Representation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset was obtained from the **University of Nottingham** and includes a total of **1300 patients**, specifically highlighting the **728 patients** who are the focus of their analysis. The dataset contains various clinicopathological covariates, which are crucial for understanding the context of the study.

In this subsection, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including the types of covariates collected, such as **Multifocality, Invasive Tumor Size, Nottingham Histological Grade, Lymphovascular invasion, and others**. They also mention the follow-up duration and the time to distant metastasis (TTDM) for these patients.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific cohort of patients and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets, I will note that the dataset is from the **University of Nottingham** and provide the relevant details as follows:

- **Dataset**: Luminal Breast Cancer Patient Dataset
  - **Description**: A dataset containing clinical data for **728 Stage-1, luminal (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer patients** who received endocrine therapy but no chemotherapy. The dataset includes various clinicopathological covariates and the time to distant metastasis (TTDM) with a follow-up of 15+ years.
  - **Source**: University of Nottingham

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the study, described its contents, and noted its source. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for future reference or processing.
