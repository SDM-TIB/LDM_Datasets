To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GESF: A Universal Discriminative Mapping Mechanism for Graph Representation Learning" by Shupeng Gui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction provides context for the research and may reference specific datasets used for evaluation.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, as it is common for authors to summarize the datasets they used for their evaluations.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is a paper citation network consisting of 2,708 papers and 5,429 citation links, with each paper classified into one of 7 classes.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another paper citation network containing 3,312 papers and 4,732 citations, classified into 6 classes.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: A larger citation network with 19,717 vertices and 88,651 citation links, where papers are classified into 3 classes.

4. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,405 online webpages with 17,981 undirected links, categorized into 17 categories.

5. **Email-eu Dataset**: An email communication network illustrating relationships among 1,005 researchers, with 25,571 links and 42 department affiliations as labels.

6. **DBLP Dataset**: An academic community network with 27,000 authors and 3,700 keywords, featuring 66,832 edges between authors and 338,210 edges between authors and keywords.

7. **BlogCatalog Dataset**: A social media network with 55,814 users, classified into multiple overlapping groups based on interests.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
