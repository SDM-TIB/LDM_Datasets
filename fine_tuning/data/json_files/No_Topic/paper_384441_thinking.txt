To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation for Diverse Voice Conversion in Noisy Environments" by Avani Tanna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "more diverse data" and "data augmentation techniques," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of voice conversion (VC) and mention the use of self-recorded examples for name pronunciation. They also reference existing models like AutoVC and FragmentVC, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach to training the FragmentVC model. They mention using a combination of **CommonVoice** and **VCTK corpus** for training. This is a crucial finding, as it identifies two specific datasets used in their research.

In the **results section**, while the authors present findings based on their experiments, they do not introduce any new datasets. However, the earlier identification of CommonVoice and VCTK corpus is sufficient for my purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **CommonVoice**, the citation is:
  > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.

- For **VCTK corpus**, the citation is:
  > Y. Y. Lin, C.-M. Chien, J.-H. Lin, H.-y. Lee, and L.-s. Lee. *Fragmentvc: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention*. In ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2021, pp. 5939â€“5943.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
