To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Evolutionary Framework for Non-linear System Identification: A Comprehensive Investigation" by Faizal Hafiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including details about their structure, size, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Benchmark Nonlinear Systems**: The paper discusses seven discrete-time benchmark nonlinear systems (S1 to S7) used for comparative evaluation of the proposed methods. Each system is described in detail, including its mathematical representation.

2. **Duﬃng's Oscillator**: This is a continuous-time system for which the authors generated a dataset by exciting the system with a uniform white noise sequence. The dataset consists of 1000 data points used for identification purposes.

3. **Wave-force Dynamics**: The authors also mention a practical case study involving wave forces acting on fixed bodies in a viscous fluid. A dataset of 1400 data points is used for identification, which is derived from flow velocity and wave force histories.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Benchmark Nonlinear Systems (S1 to S7)**, the citation is:
  > Various authors. *Identification of Nonlinear Discrete Systems with Intelligent Structure Detection*. Ph.D. thesis, University of Sheffield, England, UK, 1995.

- For the **Duﬃng's Oscillator**, the citation is:
  > Hafiz, F., Swain, A., Mendes, E. M. *Discrete Models for Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), 2018.

- For the **Wave-force Dynamics**, the citation is:
  > Swain, A., Billings, S., Stansby, P., Baker, M. *Accurate Prediction of Non-linear Wave Forces: Part I (Fixed Cylinder)*. Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 12(3), 449-485, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
