To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Query Formulation using Query By Navigation" by H.A. Proper, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract discusses the challenges of query formulation in large databases, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide further context or examples that could hint at specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodology or experiments. I will look for any references to datasets used in the development or testing of the query by navigation mechanism. If the paper includes a section specifically dedicated to datasets, I will focus on that section to gather detailed information.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. This could include foundational datasets or related works that may have utilized specific datasets relevant to the research.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of data included, and the context in which they were used. 

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to retrieve the full citation from the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy review and potential downstream processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
