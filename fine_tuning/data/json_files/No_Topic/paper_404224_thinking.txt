To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Portfolio Rebalancing Approach for the Indian Stock Market" by Jaydip Sen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **introduction and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The introduction discusses the importance of portfolio rebalancing and mentions that the study uses historical stock prices from the **NSE Website** from January 4, 2021, to September 20, 2023. This indicates that the dataset is related to stock prices from the Indian stock market.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the process of selecting sectors and stocks. They mention that they selected ten important sectors from the NSE and identified the top ten stocks based on their free-float market capitalization values. This suggests that there are specific datasets related to these sectors and stocks.

In the **results section**, the authors present detailed performance metrics for various sector portfolios, which implies that they have utilized datasets for each sector. The sectors mentioned include auto, banking, consumer durables, FMCG, IT, metal, pharma, private banks, PSU banks, and realty. Each sector's performance is evaluated based on historical stock data.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Historical Stock Prices Dataset**: This dataset includes daily stock prices from the NSE for the period from January 4, 2021, to September 20, 2023. The data is used to construct portfolios and evaluate their performance.
   - Citation: NSE Website. (Accessed on August 30, 2023). URL: http://www1.nseindia.com

2. **Sector-Specific Stock Datasets**: For each of the ten sectors, the authors have identified the top ten stocks based on free-float market capitalization. The specific stocks for each sector are detailed in the results section, and their performance metrics are derived from the historical stock prices dataset.
   - Example Citation for Auto Sector: National Stock Exchange of India. (2021). "Top Stocks in Auto Sector". Retrieved from NSE Website.

3. **Performance Metrics Datasets**: The authors present various performance metrics for each sector portfolio, including annual return, cumulative return, annual volatility, Sharpe ratio, and others. These metrics are derived from the historical stock prices dataset and are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed rebalancing approach.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset as I compile them into a structured format for further analysis or processing. This will include both the source of the historical stock prices and the specific sector datasets as referenced in the paper.
