To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object Detection and Classification in Occupancy Grid Maps using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Sascha Wirges et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on the **KITTI Bird’s Eye View benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the **KITTI Bird’s Eye View Evaluation 2017** is explicitly mentioned in the **Related Work** section and further detailed in the **Evaluation** section. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of 7481 camera images for training and 7518 for testing, along with corresponding range sensor data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3354–3361, 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **KITTI Bird’s Eye View Evaluation 2017**: This dataset includes 7481 training images and 7518 testing images, with a total of 80,256 labeled objects represented as oriented 3D bounding boxes across eight semantic classes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
