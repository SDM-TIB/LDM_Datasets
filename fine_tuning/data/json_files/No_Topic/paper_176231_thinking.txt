To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning and Image Analysis for Astronomy" by Jan Kremer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing data analysis and examples** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing large-scale data analysis in astronomy**. Here, the authors mention several datasets and resources that are significant for astronomical research. I will take note of these datasets as they are likely to be the primary focus of the paper.

In particular, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets such as:

1. **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**: This is mentioned as one of the largest astronomical surveys, providing a wealth of data on galaxies and stars. I will need to confirm the details and citation for this dataset.

2. **Galaxy Zoo**: The paper references this citizen science project that has collected classifications of galaxies. I will ensure to extract the relevant citation for this dataset.

3. **Kepler Data**: The authors mention the availability of light curves for exoplanets from the Kepler mission. I will look for the citation associated with this dataset.

4. **Debrecen Sunspot Data Archive**: This dataset is mentioned as a resource for solar imaging data. I will also find the citation for this archive.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**, I will find the original paper or resource that describes the dataset.
- For **Galaxy Zoo**, I will locate the citation that details the project and its contributions to galaxy classification.
- For **Kepler Data**, I will find the citation that discusses the dataset's availability and its significance in exoplanet research.
- For **Debrecen Sunspot Data Archive**, I will ensure to get the citation that describes the dataset and its applications in solar research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the resources available for astronomical research.
