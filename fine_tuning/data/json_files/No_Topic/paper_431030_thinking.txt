To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Electric Vehicle Battery Output Voltage: A Predictive Modeling Approach" by Narayana Darapaneni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting battery charging voltage, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used for training or testing the predictive models. If the authors mention any datasets or sources of data, I will note them down.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or data collection methods, which may be present in the methodology or experimental sections. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, size, and relevant features.

If the paper includes any **figures or tables** that summarize the datasets or their characteristics, I will analyze those as well. These visual aids often contain valuable information about the datasets used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Battery Charging Dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
