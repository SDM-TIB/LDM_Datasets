To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Challenges in Measuring Bias via Open-Ended Language Generation" by Afra Feyza Akyürek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses various prompting datasets used to measure biases in language models, which suggests that there are specific datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (section 3) where the authors describe their experimental framework. Here, they mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **BOLD Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a collection of prompts retrieved from English Wikipedia, covering various domains including gender, race, and religion. It is used to measure biases in language generation.

2. **Nozza et al. (2021) Benchmark**: This dataset consists of simple English templates specifically for measuring gender bias. It is noted that this dataset is available only for the gender domain.

In the **findings section** (section 4), the authors discuss the results obtained using these datasets, confirming their relevance in the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BOLD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jwala Dhamala, Tony Sun, Varun Kumar, Satyapriya Krishna, Yada Pruksachatkun, Kai-Wei Chang, and Rahul Gupta. *BOLD: Dataset and metrics for measuring biases in open-ended language generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pages 862–872, 2021.

- For the **Nozza et al. (2021) Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Debora Nozza, Federico Bianchi, and Dirk Hovy. *HONEST: Measuring hurtful sentence completion in language models*. In The 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
