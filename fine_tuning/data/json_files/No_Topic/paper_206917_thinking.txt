To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic segmentation of the Foveal Avascular Zone in ophthalmological OCT-A images" by Macarena Díaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method using a representative set of **168 OCT-A images**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically the **Image dataset subsection**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for validation in detail. They mention that the dataset is called **OCTAGON**, which contains **144 healthy and 24 diabetic OCT-A images**, totaling **168 cases**. This is a clear identification of the dataset.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the dataset, including the configurations of the images (3x3 mm and 6x6 mm, superficial and deep), the age range of the subjects (10 to 69 years), and the fact that images were taken from both left and right eyes of different patients. They also mention that the images were manually labeled by two expert clinicians, which adds credibility to the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OCTAGON dataset. The citation provided is:
> Díaz M, Novo J, Ortega M, Penedo MG, Gómez-Ulla F. *OCTAGON*. 2018. Available from: http://www.varpa.org/research/ophtalmology.html

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who wishes to access the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
