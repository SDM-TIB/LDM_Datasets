To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Labeling Panoramas with Spherical Hourglass Networks" by Carlos Esteves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the introduction of a spherical convolutional hourglass network for dense labeling on spherical images, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the use of panoramic sensors and mentions the need for machine learning solutions for visual perception tasks, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors state that they use all the labeled panoramas from **Im2Pano3D** (referenced as [15]) for their segmentation experiments. They mention a train-test split of 75k-10k, indicating the size of the dataset used.

Now, I will look up the full citation for the **Im2Pano3D** dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided in the references is:

> Song, S., Zeng, A., Chang, A.X., Savva, M., Savarese, S., Funkhouser, T. (2017). *Im2pano3D: Extrapolating 360 structure and semantics beyond the field of view*. arXiv.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information as follows:

1. **Im2Pano3D Dataset**: This dataset is used for segmentation experiments and consists of labeled panoramas. The authors mention a specific train-test split, which provides insight into how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the full citation for the dataset, as it is crucial for proper attribution and further reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Im2Pano3D** with the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is included for completeness.
