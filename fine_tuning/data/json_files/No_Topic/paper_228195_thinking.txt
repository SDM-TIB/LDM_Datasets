To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Organization of machine learning based product development as per ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448" by Krystian Radlak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of machine learning in safety-critical systems, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will focus on the **related work and existing standards section**. This section often contains references to datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks relevant to the paper's topic. I will look for any specific datasets that are cited or described in detail.

In the **proposed organization of ML-based product development section**, the authors may discuss datasets related to their proposed methodologies. I will pay close attention to any examples or case studies that mention datasets, particularly in the context of the ISO standards.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the paper references the **KITTI dataset** for 3D object detection, I will ensure to extract the full citation, which is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

If the paper mentions any other datasets, such as those used for lane detection or other machine learning tasks, I will follow the same process to extract their names and full citations.

Finally, I will compile all identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
