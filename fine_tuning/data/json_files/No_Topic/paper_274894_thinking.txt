To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary dynamics in populations with fluctuating size" by Immanuel Meyer and Nadav M. Shnerb, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and model systems sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the effects of environmental variations on population dynamics but does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the analysis. The introduction focuses on theoretical aspects and does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **model systems section** where the authors describe their approach. This section discusses the dynamics of populations but does not mention any datasets either.

Since the paper appears to be more theoretical and focused on modeling rather than empirical analysis, I will check the **acknowledgments and references sections** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through references to previous studies or datasets used in related works.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite various studies that may have datasets relevant to their work, but they do not provide specific datasets themselves. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses theoretical models and dynamics, it does not explicitly mention or provide datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

- The paper does not explicitly mention any datasets.
- It references various studies in the context of theoretical models, but no specific datasets are provided.

Since no datasets are identified in this paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report.
