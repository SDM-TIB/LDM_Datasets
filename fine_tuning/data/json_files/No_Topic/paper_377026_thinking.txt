To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feedback Effect in User Interaction with Intelligent Assistants" by Zidi Xiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the evaluation of intelligent assistants (IAs) and user interactions, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention analyzing logged interactions from a real-world IA system, which suggests that the dataset consists of user interaction logs. I will look for any specific names or identifiers for the datasets used.

In **section 3.1 (Study 1: Pre-event Control Period)**, the authors detail their sampling method and the size of the dataset, indicating that they randomly sampled interaction data from approximately 14,000 users. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name here.

In **section 3.2 (Study 2: Post-event New User Period)**, they mention sampling data from a six-month period involving 5,000 users. Again, while they provide details about the data, they do not specify a dataset name.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or specific dataset names, I will note that the datasets are derived from proprietary user interaction logs collected from an IA system, and they do not have formal citations as they are not publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The datasets extracted from the paper are as follows:

1. **User Interaction Logs**: This dataset consists of logged interactions from users who consented to data collection. It includes user queries and IA responses, but no specific citation is available since it is proprietary data.

2. **Pre-event Control Dataset**: A dataset sampled from approximately 14,000 users during a two-week period in August 2021. This dataset is part of the user interaction logs but does not have a specific citation.

3. **Post-event New User Dataset**: A dataset sampled from 5,000 users over a six-month period following a special event. Like the previous datasets, it is part of the user interaction logs and lacks a formal citation.

Since these datasets are not publicly available and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are proprietary datasets derived from user interactions with the IA system.

In summary, while I have identified the types of datasets used in the research, I must acknowledge that they do not have formal citations due to their proprietary nature. This will be important to document in any output or summary I prepare.
