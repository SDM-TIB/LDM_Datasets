To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Gradient-based Saliency Maps Useful in Deep Reinforcement Learning?" by Matthias Rosynski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of visualization techniques in deep reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the environments and agents used for their experiments. They mention using two environments: **Breakout-v0** and **Seaquest-v0** from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that these environments are the datasets or benchmarks used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these environments. The citation for OpenAI Gym, which includes both Breakout and Seaquest environments, is as follows:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since both environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will use this citation for both datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets identified are:

1. **Breakout-v0**: An environment from OpenAI Gym used for training reinforcement learning agents.
2. **Seaquest-v0**: Another environment from OpenAI Gym used for training reinforcement learning agents.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name and the corresponding citation.
