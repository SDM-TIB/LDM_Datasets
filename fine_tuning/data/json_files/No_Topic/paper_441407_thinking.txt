To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Database and Benchmark for Source Speaker Verification Against Voice Conversion" by Ze Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a large-scale converted speech database, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in source speaker verification due to limited data availability, hinting at the need for datasets. They mention constructing a large-scale dataset of converted speech using 16 voice conversion methods, which is a key point to note.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Database)**, where the authors detail the datasets used. They mention using **Librispeech** as the source speaker dataset and **VoxCeleb** as the target speaker dataset. The specifics provided about the subsets of these datasets (e.g., train-clean, dev-clean, test-clean for Librispeech) are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

The paper also lists the 16 voice conversion methods used to generate the converted speech dataset, which is essential for documenting the dataset's diversity and the methods employed.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

2. For **VoxCeleb**, the citation is:
   > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2017.

3. For **VoxCeleb2**, the citation is:
   > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *VoxCeleb2: Deep Speaker Recognition*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2018, pp. 1086–1090.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Librispeech**: A dataset used for training, consisting of 132,553 utterances from 1,172 speakers in the train-clean section, with additional subsets for development and testing.

- **VoxCeleb**: A dataset used for target speaker verification, containing 1,092,009 utterances from 5,994 speakers.

- **VoxCeleb2**: An extension of VoxCeleb, used for development and testing, with specific subsets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
