To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models as Carriers of Hidden Messages" by Jakub Hoscilowicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the embedding of hidden text in large language models (LLMs) but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. The citations here may provide insights into datasets used in related research, but I need to ensure they are relevant to the current study.

I will then focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically provide details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the nature of the data used in the experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

If the paper mentions any datasets used in the experiments, I will document them as follows:

1. **Identify the dataset name**: Look for explicit mentions of datasets, such as "Dataset X" or "Dataset Y".
2. **Extract relevant details**: Note the size, type, and any specific characteristics of the dataset that are mentioned.
3. **Find the full citation**: Use the references section to locate the complete citation for each dataset, ensuring that I include all authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" and provides a citation, I will format it as follows:

- For **XYZ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset Paper*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, pages xx-xx, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
