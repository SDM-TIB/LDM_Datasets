To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Financial Forecasting via Quantum Machine Learning" by Sohum Thakkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of quantum machine learning for financial forecasting, which suggests that datasets related to financial data might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention two specific use cases: churn prediction and credit risk assessment. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for these analyses.

In the **churn prediction section (3.1)**, the authors describe a dataset consisting of **304,000 datapoints with 153 features** for each datapoint, representing customer activity over six months. This dataset is crucial for understanding the churn prediction model.

In the **credit risk assessment section (6.1)**, the authors mention a dataset of approximately **141,500 observations with 32 features** each, focusing on SMEs and their default behavior. This dataset is essential for the credit risk model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary to Itaú and QC Ware, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the descriptions provided in the paper.

1. **Churn Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains **304,000 datapoints** with **153 features** representing customer activity over six months.
   - Citation: Not publicly available, proprietary to Itaú and QC Ware.

2. **Credit Risk Dataset**: 
   - Description: Comprises approximately **141,500 observations** with **32 features** related to SMEs and their default behavior.
   - Citation: Not publicly available, proprietary to Itaú and QC Ware.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the proprietary nature of the datasets and their descriptions, as formal citations are not available.

This methodical approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of providing full citations where applicable.
