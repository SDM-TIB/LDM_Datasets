To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Dimensional Robust Mean Estimation via Gradient Descent" by Yu Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses robust mean estimation but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in previous works, so I will pay close attention to any citations or mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if present) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note them down.

I will also check the **related work section** for any references to datasets that have been used in similar studies. This can provide insights into commonly used datasets in the field of robust statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "Penn Action Dataset" and the "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will look up their full citations in the references section. The citations might look something like this:

- For the **Penn Action Dataset**:
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

- For the **sub-JHMDB Dataset**:
  > Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized effectively in future research or applications.
