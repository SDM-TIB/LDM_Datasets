To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Stereo Matchability in Disparity Regression Networks" by Jingyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **Scene Flow** and **KITTI** stereo datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments** section, the authors confirm that they tested their methods on the **Scene Flow** dataset and the **KITTI 2012** and **KITTI 2015** datasets. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their work.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **Scene Flow Dataset**: The authors mention that they trained their model on this dataset. I will check the **References** section for the full citation. The citation for the Scene Flow dataset is:
   > N. Mayer, E. Ilg, P. Hausser, P. Fischer, D. Cremers, A. Dosovitskiy, and T. Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors refer to both KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets. I will also look for their citations in the **References** section. The citations for these datasets are:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.
   > M. Menze and A. Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
