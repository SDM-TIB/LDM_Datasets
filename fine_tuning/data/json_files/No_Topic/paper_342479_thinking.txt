To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physically-Based Editing of Indoor Scene Lighting from a Single Image" by Zhengqin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors present a method for editing indoor lighting from a single image, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training their models. Here, they state that they trained on the **OpenRooms dataset**, which is a large-scale synthetic indoor dataset for inverse rendering. This dataset is crucial as it provides ground truths for various outputs, including light source geometry and shading.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the dataset, including that it contains 1287 indoor scenes and a total of 118,233 images. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenRooms dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Li, Z., Yu, T.W., Sang, S., Wang, S., Song, M., Liu, Y., Yeh, Y.Y., Zhu, R., Gundavarapu, N., Shi, J., Bi, S., Xu, Z., Yu, H.X., Sunkavalli, K., Ha≈°an, M., Ramamoorthi, R., Chandraker, M. *OpenRooms: An end-to-end open framework for photorealistic indoor scene datasets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **OpenRooms Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the models in the paper. It is a large-scale synthetic indoor dataset that provides ground truths for various outputs necessary for the authors' experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
