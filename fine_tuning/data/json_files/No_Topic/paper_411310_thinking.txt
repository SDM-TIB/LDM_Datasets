To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balanced Training for Sparse GANs" by Yite Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method shows promising results on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of applying dynamic sparse training (DST) to GANs but do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10**, **STL-10**, and **TinyImageNet** datasets. Each of these datasets is used with different architectures (SNGAN and BigGAN) and various configurations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

2. **STL-10 Dataset**:
   > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pages 215â€“223, 2011. [Link to dataset](http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)

3. **TinyImageNet Dataset**:
   > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. 2016. [Link to dataset](https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/)

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **STL-10**: A dataset designed for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 5,000 labeled training images and 8,000 unlabeled images.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
