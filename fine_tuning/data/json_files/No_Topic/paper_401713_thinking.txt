To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Bellman operator for convergence of Q-learning with linear function approximation" by Diogo S. Carvalho, Pedro A. Santos, and Francisco S. Melo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss the application of their proposed multi Q-learning algorithm to well-known environments. I will look for specific names of datasets or environments that are used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using classic control problems such as **Cartpole**, **Mountaincar**, and **Acrobot**. These are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning and are often used in various studies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments. While these environments may not have formal dataset citations like traditional datasets, they are widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community. Therefore, I will provide the standard references for these environments:

1. **Cartpole**:
   > Andrew G Barto, Richard S Sutton, and Charles W Anderson. *Neuronlike adaptive elements that can solve difficult learning control problems*. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, (5): 834â€“846, 1983.

2. **Mountaincar**:
   > Andrew William Moore. *Efficient memory-based learning for robot control*. Technical report, University of Cambridge, 1990.

3. **Acrobot**:
   > Richard S Sutton. *Generalization in reinforcement learning: Successful examples using sparse coarse coding*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 8, 1995.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
