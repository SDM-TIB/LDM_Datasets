To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CN-Celeb-AV: A Multi-Genre Audio-Visual Dataset for Person Recognition" by Lantian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the CN-Celeb-AV dataset, which is a key focus of the paper, indicating that it is a significant dataset for audio-visual person recognition research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (CN-Celeb-AV)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they explain that CN-Celeb-AV consists of over 419k video segments from 1,136 individuals and is divided into two parts: a full-modality part and a partial-modality part. This section will provide essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check **section 4 (Experiments)** to see if the authors compare CN-Celeb-AV with other datasets. They mention using two other datasets for comparison: **MOBIO** and **VoxCeleb1**. This is important as it indicates the relevance of these datasets in the context of the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to find the complete citations for CN-Celeb-AV, MOBIO, and VoxCeleb1.

1. **CN-Celeb-AV**: The citation is:
   > Lantian Li, Xiaolou Li, Haoyu Jiang, Chen Chen, Ruihai Hou, Dong Wang. *CN-Celeb-AV: A Multi-Genre Audio-Visual Dataset for Person Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2023.

2. **MOBIO**: The citation is:
   > C. McCool, S. Marcel, A. Hadid, M. Pietik¨ainen et al. *Bi-modal person recognition on a mobile phone: using mobile phone data*. In ICMEW. IEEE, 2012, pp. 635–640.

3. **VoxCeleb1**: The citation is:
   > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *VoxCeleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In INTERSPEECH, 2017, pp. 2616–2620.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or research based on this work.
