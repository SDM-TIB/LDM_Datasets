To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KnitCity: a machine learning-based, game-theoretical framework for prediction assessment and seismic risk policy design" by Ad√®le Douin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and data section** (Section I.A), where the authors describe how they collected experimental data while mechanically cycling a knitted fabric. They mention that they collected data from **20 experiments**, yielding approximately **25 million force points**. This indicates that the dataset is derived from these experiments, but I need to confirm if it has a specific name or citation.

In the **data preprocessing section** (Section I.B), the authors discuss how they processed the collected data, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. I will continue to look for any references to datasets in the **event statistics section** (Section I.C) and the **supervised machine learning section** (Section II), where they describe the labels and targets used for training their models.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to the datasets used. The authors may refer to previous works or datasets that informed their study.

From my reading, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **KnitCity Dataset**: This dataset consists of the mechanical response data collected from the knitted fabric experiments, which includes approximately 25 million force points. However, it does not appear to have a formal citation in the references, as it is likely a novel dataset created for this study.

2. **Event Statistics Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the normalized fluctuations of the force signals, which are analyzed to characterize seismic-like events. Again, this dataset does not have a formal citation as it is part of the experimental data.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are original datasets created by the authors for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets mentioned in the paper, along with any relevant details that could be useful for future reference or analysis.
