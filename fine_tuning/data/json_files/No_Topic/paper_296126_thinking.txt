To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transient Stability of Hybrid Power Systems Dominated by Different Types of Grid-Forming Devices" by Xiuqiang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the data used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections often detail the datasets used for simulations or analyses. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial because datasets often originate from other studies or repositories, and the authors will provide citations for these sources. I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

In this particular paper, I will look for datasets related to transient stability analysis, hybrid power systems, or grid-forming devices. If the authors mention specific datasets or simulation models, I will document them carefully.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.

Finally, I will review the entire process to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all citations are accurate and complete.
