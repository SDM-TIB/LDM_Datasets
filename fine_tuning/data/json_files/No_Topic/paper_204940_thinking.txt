To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Poisson’s Equation using Deep Learning in Particle Simulation of PN Junction" by Zhongyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning to solve Poisson's equation but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (CNN Implementation)**, particularly the subsection **A (Input and Output)**, where the authors describe the data used for training and validation. They mention that data was generated using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and that a total of 580,000 pieces of data were created, with 70% used for training and 30% for validation. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references include various works related to Monte Carlo simulations and deep learning but do not mention a specific dataset name that is publicly available.

Since the paper primarily discusses the generation of synthetic data through simulations rather than using established datasets, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own simulations rather than a publicly available dataset. 

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset Name**: FDM-generated dataset for training and validation.
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 580,000 samples generated from simulations using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to solve Poisson's equation under various voltage biases. The dataset includes charge distributions and corresponding potential distributions, with dimensions of 9 × 41 for each sample.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is generated by the authors and not from an external source, I will note that it is not formally cited in the references.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the FDM-generated dataset, which is essential for the training and validation of the deep learning model discussed in the research. I will ensure to document this information clearly, emphasizing that it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors for their specific research purposes.
