To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Network Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications" by Jin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, as they often detail the experimental setup and the data used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of V2X communications and the need for efficient resource allocation, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach and any simulations or experiments conducted. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing their deep learning model.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for their simulations. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the authors do not provide specific datasets but instead describe a simulation environment or synthetic data generation process, I will document this as well, noting that the data is not from a publicly available dataset but rather generated for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Document any identified datasets, including their names and descriptions.
3. Check the References section for full citations of the datasets.
4. Note any synthetic data generation processes if no specific datasets are mentioned.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
