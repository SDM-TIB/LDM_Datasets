To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multiclass Simulation-Based Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model for Mixed Traffic Flow of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Driven Vehicles" by Behzad Bamdad Mehrabani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may mention datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared, as well as any performance metrics that might indicate the datasets' significance in the study.

If the paper includes a **table or figure** summarizing the datasets, I will pay close attention to that, as it may provide concise information about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Sioux Falls Network," I will look for its citation, which might be something like:
> LeBlanc, L. J., Morlok, E. K., & Pierskalla, W. P. (1975). An efficient approach to solving the road network equilibrium traffic assignment problem. *Transportation Research*, 9(5), 309â€“318. https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-1647(75)90030-1

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include details such as the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
