To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trainable Proximal Gradient Descent Based Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems" by Peicong Zheng, Xuantao Lyu, and Yi Gong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted simulations on the **Saleh-Valenzuela channel model** and the **DeepMIMO dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they used the **DeepMIMO dataset** to generate spatial channels for their simulations. They also refer to the **Saleh-Valenzuela channel model** as a method for characterizing the mmWave channels. 

In the **experiments section**, they provide additional context about the **DeepMIMO dataset**, stating that it was used to create channel data for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). They mention generating 5 million data pairs (Y, H) per SNR, which were then divided into training, validation, and testing datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DeepMIMO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alkhateeb, A. (2019). *DeepMIMO: A generic deep learning dataset for millimeter wave and massive MIMO applications*. In Proc. of Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA), San Diego, CA, pp. 1â€“8.

2. The **Saleh-Valenzuela channel model** is a well-known model in the field, but it does not have a specific citation in this paper. However, it is commonly referenced in literature. A typical citation for it is:
   > Saleh, A. A. M., & Valenzuela, R. A. (1987). *A statistical model for indoor multipath propagation*. IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 5(2), 128-137.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the full citations are accurately represented for each dataset.
