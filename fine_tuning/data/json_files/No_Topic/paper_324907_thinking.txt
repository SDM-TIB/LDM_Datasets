To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Bayesian network discovery with latent variables by scoring multiple interventions" by Kiattikun Chobtham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new algorithm for structure learning from observational and interventional datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and refer to several networks used for evaluation, which may indicate the datasets they utilized.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention six networks used for evaluation: **Asia**, **Sports**, **Property**, **Alarm**, **ForMed**, and **Pathfinder**. Each of these networks is associated with specific datasets that were generated for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations as presented in the research paper.
