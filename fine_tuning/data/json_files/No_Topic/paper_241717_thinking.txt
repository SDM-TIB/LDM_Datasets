To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape-Oriented Convolution Neural Network for Point Cloud Analysis" by Chaoyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors discuss their evaluation methods and the datasets they used for testing their model. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is used for point cloud classification tasks. It consists of 9,843 training 3D models and 2,468 testing models, covering 40 shape categories. The authors describe how they generated point cloud data from these models by uniformly sampling points.

2. **ShapeNet-Part**: This dataset is utilized for point cloud segmentation tasks. It contains 16,881 3D objects across 16 shape categories, with annotations for parts. The authors detail the training, validation, and testing splits for this dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). 3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912â€“1920.

- For **ShapeNet-Part**, the citation is:
  > Yi, L., Kim, V. G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.-C., Yan, M., Su, H., Lu, C., Huang, Q., Sheffer, A., & Guibas, L. (2016). A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections. SIGGRAPH Asia.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in the research.
