To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Image Riddles using Vision and Reasoning through Probabilistic Soft Logic" by Somak Aditya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions compiling a dataset of over 3,000 riddles, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the dataset. In this case, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the validation of their dataset. They mention that they collected a set of **3,333 riddles**, each consisting of four images and a ground truth answer. This is a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **conclusion and future works section** to see if there are any additional insights or mentions of the dataset's availability or significance. The authors state that they make the entire dataset publicly available, which is important for citation.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- **Image Riddles Dataset**: The dataset consists of 3,333 riddles, each with four images and a ground truth answer. The dataset is publicly available at the ImageRiddle website (http://bit.ly/22f9Ala).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted and documented the dataset from the research paper.
