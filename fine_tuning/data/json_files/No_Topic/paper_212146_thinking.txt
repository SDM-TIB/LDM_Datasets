To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving fraud prediction with incremental data balancing technique for massive data streams" by Rafiq Ahmed Mohammed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **European Credit Card dataset** for experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection A (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the **European Credit Card (ECC) dataset**, including its size, imbalance ratio, and the nature of the data. This section confirms that the ECC dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In this subsection, the authors provide specific details about the ECC dataset:
- It consists of **284,807 transactions** with an imbalance ratio of **1:578**, where only **0.17% (492)** of the transactions are fraudulent.
- The dataset has **30 features**, with the target feature labeled as 'Class', indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **European Credit Card dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> "European Credit Card dataset," U. M. L. Group, ed., ULB Machine Learning Group, 2013. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ECC dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
