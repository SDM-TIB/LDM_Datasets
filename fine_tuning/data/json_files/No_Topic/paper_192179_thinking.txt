To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A DDoS-Aware IDS Model Based on Danger Theory and Mobile Agents" by Mahdi Zamani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their research or that they have used in previous work. This section often provides context and may reference datasets that are critical to understanding the study's background.

I will then focus on the **methodology and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for testing or validation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on a **wireless sensor network (WSN)** and refer to a **DDoS attack scenario**. I will check if they provide any specific datasets related to WSNs or DDoS attacks, including any publicly available datasets or those created for the purpose of this research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset like the **KDD Cup 1999 dataset** for intrusion detection, I will ensure to include the full citation:
> "KDD Cup 1999 Data" (1999). Available at: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future use or analysis.
