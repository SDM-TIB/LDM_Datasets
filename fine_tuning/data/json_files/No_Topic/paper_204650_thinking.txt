To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting cities in aerial night-time images by learning structural invariants using single reference augmentation" by Philipp Sadler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Cities at Night Dataset)**, where the author discusses the dataset in detail. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the dataset, including its size, source, and specific characteristics. The author mentions that the dataset consists of **3,625 images taken from the International Space Station (ISS)**, which is a crucial detail.

In this section, I will also look for any subsets of the dataset that are mentioned, such as the subsets for specific cities like Berlin, Paris, and Madrid. The author notes that subsets can be extracted from the dataset, which is important for understanding how the dataset can be utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The relevant citations I will extract include:

1. **Cities at Night Dataset**:
   > pmission. 2017. Cities at night datasets: id good last (accessed November 2, 2017). https://pmisson.carto.com/datasets.

2. **Sanchez de Miguel (2016)**, which is referenced in the introduction:
   > Sanchez de Miguel, Alejandro. 2016. Spatial, temporal and spectral variation of light pollution and its sources: Methodology and resources.

3. **NASA Project** (for the images taken from the ISS):
   > Stefanov, William. 2017. NASA: Gateway to astronaut photography of Earth (accessed November 2, 2017). https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper references for further exploration.
