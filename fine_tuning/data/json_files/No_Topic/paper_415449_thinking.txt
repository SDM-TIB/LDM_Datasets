To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tool for the Procedural Generation of Shaders using Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms" by Elio Sasso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a tool for shader design but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction focuses on the integration of visual tools for shader programming, which may not directly reference datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** (Section III) closely, as this section often cites previous studies that may have used datasets relevant to the current research. I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the context of shader programming or evolutionary algorithms. However, the section primarily discusses methodologies and does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will also check the **experiments or evaluation sections** (if present) for any datasets used in testing or validating the proposed tool. In this case, the paper mentions a preliminary evaluation with human subjects but does not specify any datasets used for training or testing.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references list includes various tools and papers related to shader programming and evolutionary algorithms, but I need to ensure that they are indeed datasets and not just tools or methodologies.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the findings. If I find any datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations as per the references provided in the paper. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and related work sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Check the experiments or evaluation sections for any datasets used.
3. Review the references for any cited datasets.
4. Document any findings with full citations or note the absence of datasets.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture any datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
