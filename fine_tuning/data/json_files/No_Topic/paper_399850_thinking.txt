To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DIACORRECT: ERROR CORRECTION BACK-END FOR SPEAKER DIARIZATION" by Jiangyu Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, DiaCorrect, is evaluated on 2-speaker telephony data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further discusses the need for training data in speaker diarization, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), particularly the **Datasets subsection (3.1)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Simulated Conversations (SC)**: This dataset is generated using real distributions of pauses and overlaps from the DIHARD-III CTS development set. It consists of 25,000 utterances with a total duration of 2480 hours.

2. **CALLHOME Part 1 (CH Part1)**: This dataset contains 155 utterances with a total duration of 3.19 hours.

3. **CALLHOME Part 2 (CH Part2)**: This dataset includes 148 utterances with a total duration of 2.97 hours.

4. **DIHARD-III Development Set (DH3 dev)**: This dataset has 61 utterances with a total duration of 10.17 hours.

5. **DIHARD-III Evaluation Set (DH3 eval)**: This dataset also consists of 61 utterances with a total duration of 10.17 hours.

The paper provides detailed information about these datasets, including their sizes and characteristics, which is crucial for understanding their relevance to the study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DIHARD-III**, the citation is:
  > R. Neville, S. Prachi, K. Venkat, V. Rajat, C. Kenneth, C. Christopher, D. Jun, G. Sriram, and L. Mark. *The third DIHARD diarization challenge*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2021, pp. 3570–3574.

- For **CALLHOME**, the citation is:
  > “2000 NIST speaker recognition evaluation.” Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001S97.

Since the SC dataset is generated from the DIHARD-III dataset, it does not have a separate citation but is derived from it.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
