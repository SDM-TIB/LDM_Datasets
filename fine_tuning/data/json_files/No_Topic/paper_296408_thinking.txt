To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selecting a number of voters for a voting ensemble" by Eric Baxa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to data sources. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, sizes, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

In this paper, I will look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned in the context of voting ensembles or classifier performance. If the authors refer to specific datasets used for validation or testing, I will ensure to note those down.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "UCI Machine Learning Repository," I will find the appropriate citation for it.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
