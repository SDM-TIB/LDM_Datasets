To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Knowledge-based Generative Zero-Shot Learning Approach with Taxonomy Regularization" by Cheng Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four commonly used benchmarks in the zero-shot learning field: **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011)**, **NAB (North America Birds)**, **AwA1 (Animals with Attributes 1)**, **AwA2 (Animals with Attributes 2)**, and **aPY (Attributes Pascal and Yahoo)**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for a **table or detailed description** within section 4 that provides statistical information about these datasets. In the provided text, there is a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets, including the number of images, classes, and types of semantic features used. This table will help me gather specific details about each dataset.

Now, I will extract the relevant information for each dataset:

1. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011)**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images of 200 bird species, with 312 attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., Perona, P. (2010). *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. 

2. **NAB (North America Birds)**: This dataset contains 13,217 images of 485 species, with 404 attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Horn, G.V., Branson, S., Farrell, R., Haber, S., Belongie, S. (2015). *Building a bird recognition app and large scale dataset with citizen scientists: The fine print in fine-grained dataset collection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **AwA1 (Animals with Attributes 1)**: This dataset includes 30,475 images of 50 animal classes, with 85 attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lampert, C.H., Nickisch, H., Harmeling, S. (2014). *Attribute-based classification for zero-shot visual object categorization*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

4. **AwA2 (Animals with Attributes 2)**: This dataset has 37,322 images of 50 animal classes, with 85 attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Xian, Y., Lampert, C.H., Schiele, B., Akata, Z. (2017). *Zero-shot learning - a comprehensive evaluation of the good, the bad and the ugly*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

5. **aPY (Attributes Pascal and Yahoo)**: This dataset consists of 15,339 images of 32 object classes, with 64 attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Farhadi, A., Endres, I., Hoiem, D., Forsyth, D. (2009). *Describing objects by their attributes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings. Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review.
