To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical and Rigorous Uncertainty Bounds for Gaussian Process Regression" by Christian Fiedler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of new uncertainty bounds for Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and mentions numerical examples, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of numerical experiments or examples. 

In the **numerical experiments section**, the authors describe their setup and mention generating functions from an RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space) and sampling from various kernels. They also discuss the generation of ground truths and the sampling of functions, which may indicate the use of synthetic datasets rather than publicly available ones.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if the authors refer to existing datasets in the literature. If they mention specific datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Functions from RKHS**: The authors generated functions from the RKHS of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with a specified RKHS norm. This is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

2. **Control Example Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset generated from the RKHS of the SE kernel for a control example, where they sampled 100 partial states and added Gaussian noise. This dataset is also synthetic.

Since these datasets are not publicly available datasets but rather generated for the purpose of the study, I will note that they are synthetic and describe their generation process.

Now, I will compile the information about these datasets, including their descriptions and the context in which they were used, along with any relevant citations from the references section.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the datasets clearly, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant citations, even if they are not traditional datasets found in repositories.
