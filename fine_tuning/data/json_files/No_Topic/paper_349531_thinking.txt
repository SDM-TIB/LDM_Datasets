To extract datasets from the research paper titled "problexity — an open-source Python library for binary classification problem complexity assessment" by Joanna Komorniczak and Pawel Ksieniewicz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library's purpose, but it may not specify datasets directly. The introduction discusses the importance of evaluating algorithms on diverse datasets, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. However, this paper primarily focuses on the software library and its features rather than on specific datasets used for experiments. Therefore, I will need to check if the authors reference any benchmark datasets or provide examples of datasets that can be used with their library.

In the **software description section**, the authors mention that the library can analyze datasets typical for the scikit-learn module, specifically referencing the **breast cancer dataset** from scikit-learn as an example. This is a clear indication of a dataset that can be used with the library.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the breast cancer dataset. The breast cancer dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically available in the scikit-learn documentation. However, since the authors do not provide a specific citation in this paper, I will use the standard citation for the dataset:

- For the **breast cancer dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. N. Street, W. H. Wolberg, and O. L. Mangasarian. *Nuclear feature extraction for breast tumor diagnosis*. In Proceedings of the 1993 International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 378–387, 1993.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the breast cancer dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the breast cancer dataset, ready for any further processing or review.
