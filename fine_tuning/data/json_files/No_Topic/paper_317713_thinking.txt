To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing One-step and Two-step Scatter Correction and Density Reconstruction in X-ray CT" by Alexander N. Sietsema et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of scatter in X-ray CT but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their methodology for comparing the one-step and two-step approaches. They mention generating test objects and synthetic data for their experiments. Specifically, they state that they generated test objects by randomly selecting indices in 1D to create a piecewise-constant profile, which was then spun to create 2D images. This indicates that the dataset used is synthetic and generated for the purpose of the study.

The authors also mention that they generated transmissions using a forward model and added Gaussian noise to the data. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or previously established datasets in their experiments.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets, I will note that the dataset used in this study is a synthetic dataset created by the authors. I will also ensure to include the full citation of the paper itself, as it is essential for referencing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated for the purpose of the study, consisting of 2D images created from 1D radial profiles with added Gaussian noise.

Finally, I will prepare the full citation for the paper:

- Alexander N. Sietsema, Michael T. McCann, Marc L. Klasky, and Saiprasad Ravishankar. "Comparing One-step and Two-step Scatter Correction and Density Reconstruction in X-ray CT." Accepted for poster presentation at the CT Meeting 2022.

In summary, I will document the synthetic dataset created by the authors and provide the citation for the paper, as there are no external datasets referenced in this research.
