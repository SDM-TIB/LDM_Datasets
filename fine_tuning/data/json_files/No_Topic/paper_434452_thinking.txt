To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupling Feature Extraction and Classification Layers for Calibrated Neural Networks" by Mikkel Jordahn and Pablo M. Olmos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors illustrate their methods on several image classification benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors discuss their empirical evaluations and mention specific datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, particularly in the subsections that detail the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, consisting of over 600,000 labeled digits.

The authors also mention using these datasets for various experiments, including evaluating model performance on in-distribution data, shifted data, and out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them in my dataset descriptions.

The full citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011. URL: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
