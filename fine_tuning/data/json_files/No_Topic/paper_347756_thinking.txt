To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessment of U.S. Department of Transportation Lane-Level Map for Connected Vehicle Applications" by Wang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on the accuracy of the USDOT map tool, which suggests that there may be datasets related to feature points surveyed using GNSS and the USDOT tool.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **Section III (Accuracy Assessment Method)**, where the authors describe the data acquisition methods. Here, they mention using **GNSS Real-time Kinematic Positioning (RTK) survey** to determine the positions of feature points, which indicates that the data collected from this survey is a dataset of interest.

In **Section III-A (Data Acquisition: GNSS Survey)**, the authors detail the procedure for surveying feature points, indicating that they collected data from **94 feature points** over a **10 km area**. This section provides valuable information about the dataset, including the number of points and the method used for data collection.

Additionally, in **Section III-B (Data Acquisition: USDOT Map Tool)**, the authors describe how they used the USDOT tool to obtain geodetic coordinates for selected locations, further confirming that the outputs from this tool constitute another dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **GNSS Survey Dataset**: This dataset consists of the coordinates of 94 feature points surveyed using GNSS RTK technology. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is derived from their own research methodology.

2. **USDOT Map Tool Dataset**: This dataset includes the geodetic coordinates obtained from the USDOT mapping tool. Similar to the GNSS dataset, the authors do not provide a separate citation for this dataset, as it is also part of their research.

Since the paper does not reference external datasets with full citations, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts and methodologies.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to document their descriptions and the context in which they were used in the research. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets utilized in the study.
