To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton Graph-based Ultrasound-CT Non-rigid Registration" by Zhongliang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was validated on US data recorded from a volunteer and seven CT images from a public dataset. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe how they generated the point clouds from CT and US images. They mention using **seven chest templates from a public human CT dataset** and manually extracting cartilage point clouds from a volunteer's ultrasound images. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to consider: one for the CT images and one for the ultrasound images.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their method using these datasets, which reinforces their importance. They also provide a link to the public CT dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **CT Dataset**: The authors used a public human CT dataset to extract cartilage point clouds. The citation for this dataset is:
   > CT dataset: https://github.com/M3DV/RibSeg

2. **US Data**: The authors mention that the US data was recorded from a volunteer, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Since it is original data collected by the authors, I will note it as such.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets. The CT dataset has a clear citation, while the US data is original and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset identified.
