To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIFYING MIRROR DESCENT AND DUAL AVERAGING" by Anatoli Juditsky, Joon Kwon, and Ã‰ric Moulines, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **experiments or applications**. In this paper, I will look for sections that describe numerical experiments or applications of the proposed algorithms, as these sections typically detail the datasets used.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. If the datasets are well-known, I may also look for their original publications or documentation to ensure accurate citations.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Dataset A" for their experiments, I will note the following:
- The name of the dataset: "Dataset A"
- A brief description: e.g., "A dataset containing X samples with Y features."
- The full citation: e.g., "Author(s). Title of the dataset. Year. URL or publication details."

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
