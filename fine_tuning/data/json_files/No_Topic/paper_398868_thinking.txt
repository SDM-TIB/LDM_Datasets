To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViHOPE: Visuotactile In-Hand Object 6D Pose Estimation with Shape Completion" by Hongyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and tested their model on a synthetic dataset and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. This suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of 6D pose estimation and mentions the use of visuotactile perception, but it does not specify any datasets yet.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a synthetic dataset from Dikhale et al. [12] to train their framework. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies a specific dataset used in their research.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide details about the synthetic dataset, stating that it includes a subset of 11 YCB objects and that 20,000 distinct in-hand poses were simulated per object. They also mention that Unreal Engine 4.0 was used to render the observational data. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the synthetic dataset is:

- For the **VisuoTactile synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dikhale, S., Patel, K., Dhingra, D., Naramura, I., Hayashi, A., Iba, S., & Jamali, N. (2022). VisuoTactile 6D Pose Estimation of an In-Hand Object Using Vision and Tactile Sensor Data. *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*, 7(2), 1234-1241.

Additionally, the paper refers to the YCB object set, which is a commonly used benchmark in robotic manipulation. I will also include its citation:

- For the **YCB object set**, the citation is:
  > Calli, B., Singh, A., Walsman, A., Srinivasa, S., Abbeel, P., & Dollar, A. M. (2015). The YCB object and Model set: Towards common benchmarks for manipulation research. In *2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)*, 1-6.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
