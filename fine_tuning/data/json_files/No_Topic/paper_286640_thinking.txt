To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blending Dynamic Programming with Monte Carlo Simulation for Bounding the Running Time of Evolutionary Algorithms" by Kirill Antonov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will have a specific section where they describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any details provided about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses specific benchmark problems or functions, such as the **RUGGEDNESS function**, I will note that this function is used in the experiments, but I will also check if there are any datasets associated with it or if it is a standard benchmark in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions the RUGGEDNESS function as a benchmark, I will look for its original citation. If it refers to any datasets used in conjunction with this function, I will ensure to document those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
