To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Iterative CT Reconstruction using Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium" by Venkatesh Sridhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions validating the proposed MACE algorithm on "real CT data," which suggests that specific datasets are used, but does not provide names. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments based on "real CT datasets from synchrotron imaging and security scanning." This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention two datasets:
1. **Low-Res. Ceramic Composite Dataset**: This dataset was collected at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source synchrotron and consists of a single slice of a scan of a ceramic matrix composite material.
2. **Baggage Scan Dataset**: This dataset was provided by the Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT) program at Northeastern University.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely not published in standalone papers, I will note the sources as described in the paper.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For the **Low-Res. Ceramic Composite Dataset**:
  > Michael W. Czabaj, University of Utah. *Low-Res. Ceramic Composite Dataset*.

- For the **Baggage Scan Dataset**:
  > Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT) program, Northeastern University. *Baggage Scan Dataset*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I capture all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
