To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Polynomial Graph Filters: A Novel Adaptive Krylov Subspace Approach" by Keke Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments across a series of real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used for their experiments. This table includes important details such as the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and homophily ratios for each dataset. The datasets listed in this section are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, 7 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.81.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, 6 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.73.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, 3 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.80.
4. **Actor**: A co-occurrence graph with 7,600 nodes, 26,659 edges, 932 features, 5 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.22.
5. **Chameleon**: A Wikipedia graph with 2,277 nodes, 31,371 edges, 2,325 features, 5 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.23.
6. **Squirrel**: Another Wikipedia graph with 5,201 nodes, 198,353 edges, 2,089 features, 5 classes, and a homophily ratio of 0.22.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, but I can reference the original sources for the datasets based on common knowledge in the field:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
