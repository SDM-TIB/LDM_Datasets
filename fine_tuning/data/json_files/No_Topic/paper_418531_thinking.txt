To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-Based Concept Bottleneck Models: Unifying Prediction, Concept Intervention, and Probabilistic Interpretations" by Xinyue Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors explicitly list three datasets:

1. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB)**: This dataset is described as a fine-grained bird classification dataset containing 11,788 images across 200 classes and 312 annotated attributes.

2. **Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2)**: This dataset is noted as a zero-shot learning dataset with 37,322 images and 50 animal classes, using 85 attributes as concepts.

3. **Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA)**: This dataset consists of 200,000 images, each annotated with 40 face attributes, and the authors use 8 balanced attributes for their classification task.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 

- For **AWA2**, the citation is:
  > Xian, Y., Lampert, C. H., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2018). *Zero-Shot Learningâ€”a Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41(9), 2251-2265.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 3730-3738.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
