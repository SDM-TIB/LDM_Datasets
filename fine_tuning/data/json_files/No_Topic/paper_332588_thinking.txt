To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing an Interdisciplinary Science of Conversation: Insights from a Large Multimodal Corpus of Human Speech" by Andrew Reece et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the existence of a large multimodal corpus containing 1,656 recorded conversations, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Data & Code Links** section, which is likely to provide direct access to the dataset and any associated documentation. The paper mentions that the data is available for access via a registration link, which suggests that the dataset is publicly accessible.

In the **Corpus Construction** section, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including the number of conversations, the nature of the recordings (audio, video, transcripts), and the demographic diversity of participants. This section confirms that the **CANDOR corpus** is the main dataset being discussed.

I will also check the **References** section for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets that have contributed to the field of conversation analysis, such as:

1. **RAVDESS Dataset**: 
   > Livingstone, S.R., & Russo, F.A. (2018). The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English. PLoS ONE 13(5): e0196391.

2. **AffectNet Dataset**:

3. **Maptask Corpus**:

4. **Switchboard Corpus**:

5. **MELD Dataset**: 
   > Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Naik, G., Cambria, E., & Mihalcea, R. (2018). Meld: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02508.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the CANDOR corpus and the referenced datasets, along with their citations, into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
