To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Structured Mechanical Models by Minimizing Discrete Euler-Lagrange Residuals" by Kunal Menda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it mentions the use of data for fitting models, it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for learning models from noisy time-series data but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach to fitting Structured Mechanical Models (SMMs) to time-series data. Here, they mention using data from **damped and undamped double-pendulums** for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the double pendulum domain and specify that they simulated the double pendulum for 200 time-steps, using 8 trajectories for training, 4 for validation, and 4 for testing. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

To ensure I have all relevant information, I will check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets used. In **Appendix A.1**, they provide the dynamics of the double pendulum but still do not mention a specific dataset name. 

Since the authors did not provide formal dataset citations, I will note that the datasets used are based on simulations of double pendulums, specifically the **damped and undamped double pendulum dynamics**. However, I will also need to provide a citation for the foundational work on double pendulum dynamics, which is often referenced in related literature.

For the double pendulum dynamics, I will use the following citation as a reference for the foundational concepts:

- For the double pendulum dynamics, a commonly referenced source is:
  > Marsden, J. E., & West, M. (2001). Discrete mechanics and variational integrators. *Acta Numerica*, 10, 357-514.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the foundational concepts of the double pendulum dynamics.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are based on simulations of damped and undamped double pendulums, and the relevant citation for the foundational work is provided. I will ensure to document this clearly in the final output.
