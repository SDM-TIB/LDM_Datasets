To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Decompositional Semantic Parsing" by Elias Stengel-Eskin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new model for parsing into Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation. The introduction provides context about the need for structured semantic representations, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **Related Work** section. In this paper, the authors reference the **Universal Decompositional Semantics v1.0 (UDS1.0)** dataset, which is crucial for their work. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the types of annotations it includes.

In the **Data** section, the authors describe the UDS1.0 dataset in detail, explaining that it is built on top of the **English Web Treebank (EWT)** data and includes three layers of annotations: UD parses, PredPatt graph structure, and decompositional semantic annotations. This section confirms that UDS1.0 is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the UDS1.0 dataset and any other datasets mentioned. The citation for UDS1.0 is attributed to the work by White et al. (2019), which presents the dataset and its features.

The full citation for the UDS1.0 dataset is:
> Aaron Steven White, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Siddharth Vashishtha, Venkata Govindarajan, Dee Ann Reisinger, Tim Vieira, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Sheng Zhang, Francis Ferraro, Rachel Rudinger, et al. *The Universal Decompositional Semantics Dataset and Decomp Toolkit*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.13851, 2019.

Additionally, I will note the citation for the **English Web Treebank (EWT)** dataset, which is referenced as the foundational dataset for UDS1.0:
> Ann Bies, Justin Mott, Colin Warner, and Seth Kulick. *English Web Treebank*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
