To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Inter-frequency Guidance of Image for Lightweight Gaussian Denoising" by Zhuang Jia, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the author describes the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the author specifies the following datasets:

1. **DIV2K**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 800 images used for training. It is a well-known dataset for image restoration tasks.

2. **Waterloo Exploration Database (WED)**: This dataset includes 4,744 images and is also used for training.

3. **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD)**: This dataset consists of 200 images and is mentioned as part of the training dataset.

For evaluation, the author lists the following datasets:

1. **Set12**: A widely used dataset for evaluating image denoising algorithms.

2. **BSD68**: Another popular dataset for benchmarking image denoising methods.

3. **Urban100**: This dataset is also used for testing the performance of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DIV2K**, the citation is:
  > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2017, pp. 126–135.

- For **Waterloo Exploration Database (WED)**, the citation is:
  > K. Ma, Z. Duanmu, Q. Wu, Z. Wang, H. Yong, H. Li, and L. Zhang. *Waterloo Exploration Database: New Challenges for Image Quality Assessment Models*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 26, no. 2, pp. 1004–1016, 2016.

- For **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD)**, the citation is:
  > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and Its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), vol. 2, pp. 416–423, 2001.

- For **Set12**, the citation is:
  > K. Zhang, W. Zuo, Y. Chen, D. Meng, and L. Zhang. *Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 26, no. 7, pp. 3142–3155, 2017.

- For **BSD68**, the citation is the same as for BSD, as it is a subset of the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset.

- For **Urban100**, the citation is:
  > J.-B. Huang, A. Singh, and N. Ahuja. *Single Image Super-Resolution from Transformed Self-Exemplars*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, pp. 5197–5206.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for reference. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further use or analysis.
