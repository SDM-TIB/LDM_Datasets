To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiP: Hierarchical Perceiver" by JoÃ£o Carreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model demonstrates competitive performance on several datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In **subsection 4.1 (ImageNet)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the input size and the number of pixels, which confirms its use.

In **subsection 4.2 (AudioSet)**, the authors describe their use of the **AudioSet dataset**, which contains audio-visual clips for training and evaluation. They mention the number of clips and the classes involved, providing a clear context for its application.

In **subsection 4.3 (Kinetics-600)**, the authors indicate that they used the **Kinetics-600 dataset** for video classification tasks, detailing the input format and the number of frames.

In **subsection 4.4 (PASCAL VOC)**, the authors mention using the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks, specifying the training and validation sets used.

In **subsection 4.5 (ModelNet40)**, the authors refer to the **ModelNet40 dataset**, which is used for shape classification tasks involving point clouds.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. For **AudioSet**, the citation is:
   > Jort F. Gemmeke, Daniel P.W. Ellis, Dylan Freedman, et al. *AudioSet: An Ontology and Human-Labeled Dataset for Audio Events*. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2017.

3. For **Kinetics-600**, the citation is:
   > Joao Carreira, Eric Noland, Andras Banki-Horvath, et al. *A Short Note About Kinetics-600*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.01340, 2018.

4. For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. 2012.

5. For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
   > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, et al. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
