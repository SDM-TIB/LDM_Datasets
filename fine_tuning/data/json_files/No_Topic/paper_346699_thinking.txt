To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Winning the CVPRâ€™2022 AQTC Challenge: A Two-stage Function-centric Approach" by Shiwei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the AQTC task and their proposed method but do not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Parameters setting)**, the authors mention that they trained their model on a training set containing **80 instructional videos** and evaluated it on a testing set with **20 instructional videos**. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets. This indicates that the datasets may be proprietary or not widely recognized, which is common in specialized tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various works, but none appear to be specific datasets. The closest mention is of a previous work by Benita Wong et al. titled "AssistQ: Affordance-centric question-driven task completion for egocentric assistant," which is referenced multiple times. This suggests that the authors may have used a dataset from this prior work, but it is not explicitly stated.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the datasets used are likely derived from the authors' previous research or are part of a challenge dataset that is not named in the paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not explicitly name any datasets used for training or evaluation.
- The datasets are likely proprietary or part of a challenge, and no full citations can be provided.

I will document this information clearly, indicating the lack of specific dataset names and citations, which is crucial for transparency in research.
