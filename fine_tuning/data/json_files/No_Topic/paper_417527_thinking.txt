To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSpeed-FastGen: High-throughput Text Generation for LLMs via MII and DeepSpeed-Inference" by Connor Holmes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the performance improvements of DeepSpeed-FastGen but does not mention any specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the context of large language models (LLMs) and existing frameworks but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **performance evaluation section** (Section 4) and the **benchmarking methodology** (Section 4.1). Here, the authors describe their evaluation methods and metrics but do not explicitly mention any datasets used for benchmarking. They refer to models like Llama-2 but do not provide dataset names.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the models mentioned. The references include various papers and resources related to LLMs and their serving techniques, but they do not specifically list datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, I will ensure to note the relevant citations for the models discussed, as they may lead to datasets in their respective papers:

1. **Llama-2**:
   > Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timothée Lacroix, Baptiste Rozière, Naman Goyal, Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, et al. *Llama: Open and efficient foundation language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971, 2023.

2. **GPT-4**:
   > OpenAI. *Gpt-4*. https://openai.com/gpt-4, 2023.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will summarize my findings and note that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the text. If any datasets were referenced indirectly through the models, I will include their citations as shown above.
