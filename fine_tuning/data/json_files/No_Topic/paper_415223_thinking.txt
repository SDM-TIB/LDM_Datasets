To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wideband Sample Rate Converter Using Cascaded Parallel-serial Structure for Synthetic Instrumentation" by Ruiyuan Ming et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experimental results for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sample rate converters (SRC) in digital signal processing but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to look for any datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the implementation of their SRC structure and mention a **Digital Down Converter (DDC) system** used for verification. They detail the input signals generated by a **Signal Generator** and the two-tone signal used in their experiments. However, they do not provide specific datasets or publicly available datasets for others to use.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various works related to digital signal processing and SRC but do not explicitly mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Input Signal**: The input signal for the experiments is generated using a **Signal Generator (ROHDE & SCHWARZ, SMB100A)**, but this is not a dataset in the traditional sense.
2. **Two-tone Signal**: The authors mention using a two-tone signal composed of frequencies ranging from 10 MHz to 80 MHz, but again, this is not a dataset that can be cited.

Given that no formal datasets are provided in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. However, I will note the experimental setup and input signals as part of the findings.

In summary, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide specific datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.
