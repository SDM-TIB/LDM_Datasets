To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATNet: Multi-Level Fusion Transformer-Based Model for Day-Ahead PV Generation Forecasting" by Matteo Tortora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model using the **Ausgrid benchmark dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section III (Materials)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three primary data sources:

1. **Ausgrid Dataset**: This dataset contains historical electricity demand and PV power generation data from 300 residential solar PV units in New South Wales, Australia. It records power generation (in kWh) over a period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, with a sampling time of 30 minutes.

2. **OpenWeatherMap**: This is an online weather data service providing real-time, forecast, and historical weather data. The authors utilize this service for meteorological data relevant to their forecasting model.

3. **Solcast**: This service provides forecasts, live, and historical solar irradiance data, which is also used in the study.

In **section III-A**, the authors provide a detailed description of the Ausgrid dataset, including its structure and the specific features it contains, such as installed solar panel capacity and total consumption.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ausgrid dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ausgrid, “Solar home electricity data,” 2014, [Online; Accessed 25-01-2023]. Available: https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Our-Research/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data

- For **OpenWeatherMap**, the citation is:
  > OpenWeatherMap, “Openweathermap,” 2023, [Online; Accessed 25-01-2023]. Available: https://openweathermap.org

- For **Solcast**, the citation is:
  > Solcast, “Global solar irradiance data and PV system power output data,” 2019, [Online; accessed 2023-06-15]. Available: https://solcast.com

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
