To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ABC Easy as 123: A Blind Counter for Exemplar-Free Multi-Class Class-agnostic Counting" by Michael Hobley and Victor Prisacariu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a new dataset called **MCAC**, which is crucial for the study. This suggests that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (MCAC Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the MCAC dataset. They explain that MCAC is the first multi-class class-agnostic counting dataset, containing images with multiple classes of objects. The section outlines the dataset's structure, including the number of images, classes, and the types of annotations available (e.g., instance labels, bounding boxes, etc.).

In this section, I will note the following key details about the MCAC dataset:
- It contains 4,756 training images, 2,413 validation images, and 2,114 test images.
- The dataset includes between 1 and 4 classes of objects per image, with a mean of 1.75 classes.
- Each image has associated instance labels, bounding boxes, and occlusion percentages.

Additionally, the authors mention that the MCAC dataset is available online, which is important for citation and accessibility.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MCAC dataset. The authors reference their own work when discussing the dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the MCAC dataset is:
> Hobley, M., & Prisacariu, V. (2023). ABC Easy as 123: A Blind Counter for Exemplar-Free Multi-Class Class-agnostic Counting. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MCAC dataset as it is critical for proper attribution in any further use of this dataset.
