To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Similarity Score for Measuring Visual Similarity at Semantic Level" by Senran Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the performance of the proposed metric, SeSS, is tested on different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the experiments conducted. In this section, they mention that the performance of SeSS is validated using various datasets, including:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the source for the PSG dataset, which contains nearly 50,000 images with annotated relationships between segmented objects.

2. **PSG Dataset**: The authors specifically mention that this dataset is used for generating object-relation graphs and contains relationships defined for the segmented objects.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors discuss experiments involving images transmitted by traditional and semantic communication systems, but they do not introduce new datasets beyond those already identified.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

- For the **PSG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Yang, Y. Z. Ang, Z. Guo, K. Zhou, W. Zhang, and Z. Liu. *Panoptic Scene Graph Generation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, 2022, pp. 178–196.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
