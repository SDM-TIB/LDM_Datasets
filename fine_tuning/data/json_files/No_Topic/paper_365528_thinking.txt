To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Scene Graph Generation with Generative Transformers" by Sanjoy Kundu and Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **Visual Genome dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **Visual Genome dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset for scene graph generation tasks.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about the dataset. The authors describe the dataset as containing 108k images with 150 object classes and 50 types of relationships, which provides a clear understanding of the dataset's scope and application.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the Visual Genome dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

In summary, the key steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying the Visual Genome dataset as the primary dataset used in the research.
3. Confirming details in the experiments section.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry for the Visual Genome dataset.
