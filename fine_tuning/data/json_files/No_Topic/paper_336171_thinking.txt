To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Hand Gesture Customization on Wrist-Worn Devices" by Xuhai Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a large-scale study was conducted with over 500 participants to collect data for training a gesture recognition model. This suggests that there is a dataset related to this study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Collection)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for training their model. Here, they describe the participants, the apparatus used (Apple Watch Series 5 and 6), and the data collection process, which involved participants performing gestures multiple times. They mention collecting approximately 110,000 gesture samples and 60 hours of negative samples, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

In this section, the authors also provide a comprehensive summary of the data collection, including participant demographics and the types of gestures performed. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not explicitly cite a pre-existing dataset but describes the dataset they collected during their study. Therefore, I will note the details provided in the paper as the primary source of the dataset.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Gesture Recognition Dataset**: This dataset was collected from 512 participants performing four dynamic hand gestures (Clench, Double Clench, Pinch, and Double Pinch) and includes both gesture and non-gesture (negative) samples. The dataset consists of approximately 110,000 gesture samples and 60 hours of negative samples, with various factors considered during data collection, such as body posture and hand-eye angles.

Since there is no external citation for a pre-existing dataset, I will use the details provided in the paper as the citation for the dataset itself.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, including the citation of the paper itself, which serves as the source for the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:

Hudson, Charlie Maalouf, Jax Seyed Mousavi, and Gierad Laput. 2022. Enabling Hand Gesture Customization on Wrist-Worn Devices. In CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI â€™22), April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 19 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3501904

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
