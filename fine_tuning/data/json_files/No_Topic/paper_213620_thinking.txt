To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Off-Policy Actor-Critic" by Shangtong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm on Mujoco robot simulation tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the specific tasks used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they benchmarked their algorithm on **five Mujoco robot simulation tasks from OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these tasks.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors refer to the Mujoco tasks but do not provide specific dataset names. However, since Mujoco tasks are well-known, I can infer that the datasets used are the standard datasets associated with these tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The Mujoco tasks are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, and I will find the appropriate citations for these tasks.

The citations for the Mujoco tasks are as follows:

1. **Mujoco**:

2. **Mujoco Robot Simulation Tasks**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
