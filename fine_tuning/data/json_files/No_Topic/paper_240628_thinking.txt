To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReRe: A Lightweight Real-time Ready-to-Go Anomaly Detection Approach for Time Series" by Ming-Chang Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using real-world time-series datasets, which indicates that datasets are present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **CPU-cc2**: This dataset is derived from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) and contains 4032 data points collected from April 10, 2014, to April 24, 2014, with a time interval of 5 minutes.

2. **CPU-c53**: Another dataset from NAB, also containing 4032 data points, collected from February 14, 2014, to February 28, 2014, with the same 5-minute interval.

3. **real47**: This dataset is from the Yahoo benchmark datasets and contains 1427 data points with a time interval of 1 hour. The time period for this dataset is not explicitly provided.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**, the citation is:
  > Numenta, Inc. (2015) “NAB: Numenta Anomaly Benchmark [Online code repository],” Redwood City, CA: Numenta, Inc. Available: https://github.com/numenta/NAB

- For the **Yahoo benchmark datasets**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo, S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0, Available: http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70, 2015.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
