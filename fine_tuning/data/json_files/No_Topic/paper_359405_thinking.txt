To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly detection in dynamic networks" by Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi and Rob J Hyndman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method, oddnet, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **results** sections. In the **results** section, the authors mention conducting experiments on four synthetic networks and four real datasets. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **results** section, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **US Senate co-voting network**: This dataset is discussed in section 3.2.1, where the authors reference the work of Lee et al. (2020) and Huang et al. (2020) regarding the voting patterns of senators over multiple Congresses.

2. **UCI Message network**: In section 3.2.2, the authors refer to the dataset made available by Panzarasa et al. (2009), which captures interactions among students at the University of California, Irvine.

3. **Canadian bill voting dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in section 3.2.3, with a reference to Huang et al. (2020), covering voting patterns in the Canadian Parliament from 2006 to 2019.

4. **US election blogs dataset**: In section 3.2.4, the authors discuss the dataset collected by Almquist & Butts (2013) that captures intra-group blog citation dynamics during the 2004 US presidential election.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **US Senate co-voting network**, the citation is:
  > Lee, J., Li, G., & Wilson, J. D. (2020). Varying-coefficient models for dynamic networks. *Computational Statistics and Data Analysis*, 152.

- For the **UCI Message network**, the citation is:
  > Panzarasa, P., Opsahl, T., & Carley, K. M. (2009). Patterns and dynamics of users’ behavior and interaction: Network analysis of an online community. *Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology*, 60(5), 911–932.

- For the **Canadian bill voting dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, S., Hitti, Y., Rabusseau, G., & Rabbany, R. (2020). Laplacian change point detection for dynamic graphs. In *Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, pp. 349–358.

- For the **US election blogs dataset**, the citation is:
  > Almquist, Z. W., & Butts, C. T. (2013). Dynamic network logistic regression: A logistic choice analysis of inter- and intra-group blog citation dynamics in the 2004 US presidential election. *Political Analysis*, 21(4), 430–448.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
