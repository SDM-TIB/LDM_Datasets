To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Objectness for Open World Object Detection" by Orr Zohar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, it discusses the performance of the proposed method on OWOD benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection dedicated to datasets. In this paper, there is a section labeled **"Datasets"** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two benchmarks: 

1. **M-OWODB (superclass-mixed OWOD benchmark)**: This benchmark includes images from MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC2007, and PASCAL VOC2012, grouped into non-overlapping tasks.
2. **S-OWODB (superclass-separated OWOD benchmark)**: This benchmark is constructed using only the MS-COCO dataset, with a clear separation of super-categories.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the research paper along with their proper citations.
