To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Illuminating the Space of Enemies Through MAP-Elites" by Breno M. F. Viana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss previous works and may reference datasets used in those studies. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are relevant to the research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach in detail, including any datasets they used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors discuss any datasets in the context of their findings. They may provide performance metrics or comparisons based on the datasets used, which can help in understanding the datasets' significance in the research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

As I identify datasets, I will ensure to document the following for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references section of the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work or discussions.
