To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Privacy Preserving Encodings through Adversarial Training" by Francesco Pittaluga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the approach on tasks of real-world complexity, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In **Section 4.1**, they mention using the **Places-365 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their privacy-preserving encoders in inhibiting the detection of specific scene categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Places-365 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> B. Zhou, A. Lapedriza, A. Khosla, A. Oliva, and A. Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Places-365 dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset mentioned (Places-365) and its relevance to the experiments.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.
4. Document the dataset details and citation clearly.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and present the dataset information from the research paper.
