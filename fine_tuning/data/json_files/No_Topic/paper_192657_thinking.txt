To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opinion mining of text documents written in Macedonian language" by Andrej Gajduk and Ljupco Kocarev, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** (Section IV) to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on opinion mining from forum posts, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of forum posts from the kajgana forum, specifically noting that 800 posts were manually tagged as positive, negative, or objective. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of posts and their classifications.

The authors also mention that the posts are grouped into 47 disjoint topics and that there are over 50,000 subtopics. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from the kajgana forum, and the authors do not provide a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on user-generated content from the forum.

Since the dataset is not formally published in a separate paper, I will create a citation entry for the dataset based on the paper itself, indicating that it is a manually created dataset from forum posts.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Gajduk, A., & Kocarev, L. (2023). Opinion mining of text documents written in Macedonian language. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date]. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the citation in a clear format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it is structured and complete.
