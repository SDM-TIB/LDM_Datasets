To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Perception and Planning with Deep Active Inference" by Ozan Ã‡atal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of active inference and its applications but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section**, which is typically where datasets are detailed. 

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments using the **Mountain Car problem** as a test environment. However, they do not mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. Instead, they describe the generative model and the policies tested in the context of this environment.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily discuss theoretical frameworks and previous works related to active inference and deep learning, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that the paper does not provide any specific datasets for use in experiments, and therefore, there are no full citations to report. 

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all relevant sections of a research paper to identify datasets, as they may not always be explicitly stated or may be embedded within broader discussions of methodologies or experimental setups.
