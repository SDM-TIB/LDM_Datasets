To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spotting Collective Behaviour of Online Frauds in Customer Reviews" by Sarthika Dhawan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their research. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **YelpNYC**: This dataset contains hotel and restaurant reviews from New York City. The authors reference a previous work by Rayana and Akoglu (2015) for this dataset.

2. **YelpZIP**: This dataset is an aggregation of reviews on restaurants and hotels from various areas with continuous zip codes starting from New York City. It also cites Rayana and Akoglu (2015).

3. **Amazon**: This dataset includes reviews on musical instruments and cites the work of He and McAuley (2016).

4. **Playstore**: This dataset consists of reviews of different applications available on Google Playstore. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the section, but they mention that fake reviews and spammers are already marked in the Yelp datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **YelpNYC** and **YelpZIP**, the citation is:
  > Shebuti Rayana and Leman Akoglu. *Collective opinion spam detection: Bridging review networks and metadata*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 985–994, Sydney, NSW, Australia, August 2015.

- For **Amazon**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (WWW), pages 507–517, 2016.

The **Playstore** dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, so I will note that it is mentioned without a formal reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
