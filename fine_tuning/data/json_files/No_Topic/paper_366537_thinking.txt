To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Characterization of Maximum Nash Welfare for Indivisible Goods" by Warut Suksompong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) rule and does not mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical framework and does not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **references section** to identify any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers that discuss fair division and allocation of indivisible goods, but I need to determine if any of these papers contain datasets that are relevant to the current study.

Upon reviewing the references, I notice that some papers may have associated datasets, but the current paper itself does not explicitly mention any datasets used for empirical analysis or experiments. The focus appears to be entirely theoretical, with no empirical data or datasets being utilized or referenced directly in the text.

Since there are no datasets mentioned in the paper itself, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations. However, I will note that the references include significant works in the field of fair division, which may have their own datasets, but these are not part of the current paper's content.

In conclusion, I will summarize that the paper does not contain any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to extract. If I were to find datasets in a similar paper, I would follow the same steps of examining the abstract, introduction, results, and references for any explicit mentions of datasets and their citations.
