To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypervolume-Optimal Âµ-Distributions on Line/Plane-based Pareto Fronts in Three Dimensions" by Ke Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** where the authors often discuss the context and may reference datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will check for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, size, and purpose.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely to see if the authors mention any datasets used for validation or testing of their methods. This section often contains valuable information about the datasets, including how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "DTLZ1" or "WFG3," I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments for detailed descriptions.
3. Check the results or experiments section for additional dataset information.
4. Consult the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for further use.
