To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Newton–Cotes Graph Neural Networks: On the Time Evolution of Dynamic Systems" by Lingbing Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on several benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific applications.

In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **N-body simulation benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in simulating dynamic systems with various settings, including the number of particles and physical constraints.

2. **MD17 dataset**: This dataset consists of molecular dynamics simulations of eight different molecules, which is crucial for testing the method's applicability in molecular dynamics.

3. **CMU Motion Capture Database**: This dataset is used for reasoning human motion, providing a basis for evaluating the method's performance in motion prediction tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **N-body simulation benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wenbing Huang, Jiaqi Han, Yu Rong, Tingyang Xu, Fuchun Sun, and Junzhou Huang. *Equivariant Graph Mechanics Networks with Constraints*. In ICLR, 2022.

- For the **MD17 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Chmiela, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Huziel E Sauceda, Igor Poltavsky, Kristof T Schütt, and Klaus-Robert Müller. *Machine Learning of Accurate Energy-Conserving Molecular Force Fields*. Science Advances, 3(5):e1603015, 2017.

- For the **CMU Motion Capture Database**, the citation is:
  > CMU. Carnegie-Mellon Motion Capture Database. 2003. URL http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
