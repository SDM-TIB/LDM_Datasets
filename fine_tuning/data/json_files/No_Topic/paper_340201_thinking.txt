To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Implicit Representations for Physical Parameter Inference from a Single Video" by Florian Hofherr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses the ability to infer physical parameters from a single video, which suggests that there may be datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and may mention specific datasets used for training or testing their models.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Synthetic Data), I find that the authors mention using a **two masses spring system** dataset, which is a synthetic dataset created for their experiments. They also refer to a **nonlinear damped pendulum** dataset, which is likely another synthetic dataset used for evaluation.

In section 4.2 (Real World Data), the authors describe their experiments on real-world datasets, specifically mentioning videos captured for three physical systems: a **sliding block**, a **thrown ball**, and a **pendulum**. These datasets are crucial for validating their approach in real-world scenarios.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily described in the context of the authors' experiments and may not have formal citations, I will note them as they are presented in the paper.

Here are the datasets I have identified:

1. **Two Masses Spring System**: A synthetic dataset used for evaluating the model's performance on a two-body system with spring dynamics. This dataset is created by the authors for their experiments.

2. **Nonlinear Damped Pendulum**: Another synthetic dataset used for testing the model's ability to infer parameters from a pendulum's motion. This dataset is also created by the authors.

3. **Sliding Block Dataset**: A real-world dataset consisting of videos of a block sliding on an inclined plane. The authors captured this dataset to evaluate their method in a practical scenario.

4. **Thrown Ball Dataset**: A real-world dataset that includes videos of a thrown ball, used to test the model's performance in recognizing and inferring physical parameters from the motion of the ball.

5. **Pendulum Dataset**: A real-world dataset involving videos of a pendulum, which is used to validate the authors' approach in a real-world context.

Since the datasets are primarily described in the context of the authors' experiments and do not have formal citations, I will document them as follows:

- **Two Masses Spring System**: Created by the authors for their experiments.
- **Nonlinear Damped Pendulum**: Created by the authors for their experiments.
- **Sliding Block Dataset**: Captured by the authors for real-world evaluation.
- **Thrown Ball Dataset**: Captured by the authors for real-world evaluation.
- **Pendulum Dataset**: Captured by the authors for real-world evaluation.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its context within the research paper.
