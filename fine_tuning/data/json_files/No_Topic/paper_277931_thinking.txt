To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Contextual Bandits for Fast Initial Access in mmWave Based User-Centric Ultra-Dense Networks" by Insaf Ismath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulations based on ray-tracing and stochastic channel models, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section V (Performance Analysis)**, where the authors describe their simulation models. Here, they mention two types of simulation models: the **ray-tracing channel model** and the **stochastic channel model**. I will need to determine if these models are based on publicly available datasets or if they are proprietary datasets created by the authors.

In the **ray-tracing channel model** subsection, the authors refer to using a commercial ray-tracing software called Wireless Insite for their simulations. This indicates that the dataset generated from this software may not be publicly available, but I will note it as a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **stochastic channel model** subsection, the authors mention that the channel parameters for path loss, shadowing, angular dispersion, and spatial clusters are selected based on a reference ([12]). This reference may provide additional context or datasets used for the stochastic model.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for any datasets or models mentioned. The reference [12] is:
> M. R. Akdeniz, Y. Liu, M. K. Samimi, S. Sun, S. Rangan, T. S. Rappaport, and E. Erkip. *Millimeter wave channel modeling and cellular capacity evaluation*. IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 32, no. 6, pp. 1164â€“1179, 2014.

Since the authors did not provide specific datasets with unique names or citations, I will summarize the datasets based on the models they used:

1. **Ray-Tracing Channel Model**: This model utilizes the Wireless Insite software for performance analysis in a realistic environment. The dataset is generated through simulations but is not publicly available.

2. **Stochastic Channel Model**: The parameters for this model are based on the work cited in reference [12], which may include datasets related to mmWave channel modeling.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the research, ensuring to include full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
