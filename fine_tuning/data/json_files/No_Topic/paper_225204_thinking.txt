To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proof–Based Synthesis of Sorting Algorithms Using Multisets in Theorema" by Isabela Drămnesc and Tudor Jebelean, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically detail the experiments conducted and may specify the datasets used for testing or validation. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments. Instead, they focus on the theoretical aspects of algorithm synthesis and the Theorema system. However, I will still check the **References section** to see if there are any cited works that might refer to datasets relevant to their research.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Theorema System**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, the Theorema system is mentioned as the platform used for experiments. It is important to note that the authors utilize this system for their proofs and algorithm synthesis.

2. **Related Works**: The authors reference previous works that may have utilized datasets, but these are not explicitly detailed in the current paper. I will compile the citations from the references that may lead to datasets used in related studies.

Now, I will gather the full citations for any relevant works mentioned in the references that could potentially lead to datasets:

- For the Theorema system, the citation is:
  > B. Buchberger, T. Jebelean, T. Kutsia, A. Maletzky, and W. Windsteiger. *Theorema 2.0: Computer-Assisted Natural-Style Mathematics*. Journal of Formalized Reasoning, 9(1):149–185, 2016. doi:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/4568.

- For the foundational work on multisets, the citation is:
  > W. D. Blizard. *Multiset Theory*. Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, 30(1):36–66, 1989. doi:10.1305/ndjfl/1093634995.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that the authors primarily focus on theoretical contributions rather than empirical evaluations based on datasets.

In summary, while I did not find explicit datasets in this paper, I have noted the relevant systems and foundational works that could be of interest for future research or dataset exploration.
