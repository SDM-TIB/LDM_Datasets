To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is it like to program with artificial intelligence?" by Advait Sarkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, datasets are discussed in a specific section where the authors describe their sources, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments. If such a section exists, it will likely contain the most relevant information.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the paper discusses a dataset like "GridBook," I will look for its full citation, which might include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have identified the datasets and gathered the necessary citation information, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be used for further research or analysis.
