To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representing and Computing Uncertainty in Phonological Reconstruction" by Johann-Mattis List et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a new framework for representing uncertainty in linguistic reconstruction, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of phonological reconstruction.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials)**, where the authors explicitly mention three etymological datasets. This section provides detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their contents and origins:

1. **Burmish Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8 Burmish languages and includes 269 etymologies reflected in at least two descendant languages, totaling 1,442 reflexes. It was originally compiled by Gong and Hill (2020) and later converted to CLDF formats by List and Forkel (2022). The dataset is accessible online at https://github.com/lexibank/hillburmish.

2. **Karen Dataset**: This dataset comprises 10 Karenic languages and offers 365 etymologies originally proposed by Luangthongkum (2019), reflected in at least 2 languages with a total of 2,866 reflexes. It was compiled for the study by List and Forkel (2022) and is accessible online at https://github.com/lexibank/luangthongkumkaren.

3. **Panoan Dataset**: This dataset includes 20 Panoan languages and features the reconstruction of 514 cognate sets across 470 concepts proposed by Oliveira (2014), with a total of 7,305 reflexes. The dataset was manually aligned during digitization by Blum and Barrientos (2023) and is accessible online at https://github.com/pano-tacanan-history/oliveiraprotopanoan.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Burmish Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gong, X., & Hill, N. W. (2020). *Materials for an Etymological Dictionary of Burmish*. Zenodo, Geneva.

- For the **Karen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Luangthongkum, T. (2019). *A view on proto-karen phonology and lexicon*. Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, 12(1):i–lii.

- For the **Panoan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oliveira, S. C. S. de. (2014). *Contribuições para a reconstrução do Protopáno*. Ph.D. thesis, Universidade de Brasília, Brasília.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its citation and accessible link.
