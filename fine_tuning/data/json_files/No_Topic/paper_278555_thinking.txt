To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) With Multiple Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces" by Yanyu Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

If the paper does not have a specific section for datasets, I will check the **methodology** or **results** sections, as authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments in these parts. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **NIST Special Database 19** for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might read something like:
> NIST. *NIST Special Database 19: The Face Recognition Technology (FERET) Database*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 1996.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
