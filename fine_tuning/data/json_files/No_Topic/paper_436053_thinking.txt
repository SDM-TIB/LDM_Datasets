To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Who’s in and who’s out? A case study of multimodal CLIP-filtering in DataComp" by Rachel Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **DataComp's CommonPool** dataset, which is a significant indicator that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to find specific mentions of datasets. In the methodology, the authors describe the **CommonPool dataset** as consisting of 12.8 billion image-text pairs, which is crucial information. They also reference the **LAION-400M** and **LAION-5B** datasets, indicating that these datasets were created using similar filtering techniques.

In the **discussion section**, the authors elaborate on the implications of using these datasets, particularly focusing on the biases introduced by the filtering process. They emphasize the importance of the **DataComp** dataset in their analysis, which further confirms its relevance.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets identified:

1. **DataComp's CommonPool Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as a benchmark for auditing the CLIP-filtering process. It consists of 12.8 billion image-text pairs and is used to analyze the impact of filtering on demographic representation.

2. **LAION-400M Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being created using the CLIP-filtering method and contains 400 million image-text pairs.

3. **LAION-5B Dataset**: This dataset is also created using the CLIP-filtering method and contains 5 billion image-text pairs.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset, including their significance in the context of the research. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
