To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fourier Neural Network Approximation of Transition Densities in Finance" by Rong Du and Duy-Minh Dang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss various models and methods, but they also mention specific datasets related to financial models. For instance, they refer to datasets derived from characteristic functions conditioned on different variance values for training their model. I will note down these datasets and their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention datasets related to the Merton jump-diffusion model or the Heston model, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
