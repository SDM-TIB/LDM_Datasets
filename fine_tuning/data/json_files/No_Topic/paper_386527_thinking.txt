To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Document-Level Multi-Event Extraction with Event Proxy Nodes and Hausdorff Distance Minimization" by Xinyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of document-level multi-event extraction and hint at the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluated their model on:

1. **ChFinAnn Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32,040 financial documents, with a breakdown of training, development, and test sets. The authors provide details about the event types and their distributions.

2. **DuEE-Fin Dataset**: This dataset contains around 11,900 financial documents and includes 13 event types. The authors mention that the ground truth annotations for the test set are not publicly available, and they describe how they set aside documents for the development and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ChFinAnn Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, S., Xu, W., & Bian, J. (2019). Doc2EDAG: An end-to-end document-level framework for Chinese financial event extraction. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 337–346, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **DuEE-Fin Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han, C., Zhang, J., Li, X., Xu, G., Peng, W., & Zeng, Z. (2022). DuEE-Fin: A large-scale dataset for document-level event extraction. In Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing, pages 172–183, Cham. Springer International Publishing.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ChFinAnn Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 32,040 financial documents, with specific event types and distributions.
2. **DuEE-Fin Dataset**: A dataset with around 11,900 financial documents and 13 event types, with specific details on the training and testing setup.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further use or analysis.
