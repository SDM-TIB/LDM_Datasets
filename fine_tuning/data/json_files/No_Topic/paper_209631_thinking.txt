To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Credal Sum-Product Networks" by Amélie Levray and Vaishak Belle, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of learning probabilistic representations from data, which may lead to references to specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsection that explicitly lists the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets drawn from previous works, specifically referencing datasets used in the context of learning sum-product networks. 

In the **results section**, they provide a table summarizing the datasets used, including their characteristics such as the number of variables and instances. This is crucial for understanding the datasets' relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The authors typically cite the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived. This is essential for providing accurate citations.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:
