To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Planning in Open-Ended Dialogue using Reinforcement Learning" by Deborah Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a dialogue system trained using crowd-sourced data, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention that the training data consists of crowd-sourced conversations generated by human evaluators. This indicates that there is a specific dataset used for training the models.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the work of Szpektor et al. [38], which is crucial since it describes the dynamic composition approach used in their dialogue management model. This could lead to identifying the dataset used in that work.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the training data is described as follows:

1. **Crowd-sourced Conversations Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 20,000 conversations generated by human evaluators, with an average of 3 bot responses per conversation. Each response is rated on a scale of -3 to 7, providing a rich source of training data for the dialogue system.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the work by Szpektor et al. that is referenced in the paper. The citation is:

- Szpektor, I., Cohen, D., Elidan, G., Fink, M., Hassidim, A., Keller, O., Kulkarni, S., Ofek, E., Pudinsky, S., Revach, A., et al. (2020). *Dynamic composition for conversational domain exploration*. In Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020, 872â€“883.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
