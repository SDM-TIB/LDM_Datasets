To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signal in the noise: temporal variation in exponentially growing populations" by Eric W. Jones et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or experiments that involve data collection.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe bacterial growth experiments involving **Escherichia coli** and **Staphylococcus aureus**, which suggests that there are datasets related to these experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific references to datasets, including how they were collected and analyzed. The authors mention measuring the growth of bacteria under various conditions, which likely involves quantitative data that can be classified as datasets.

I will also check the **figures and supplementary information** for any additional datasets that may not be explicitly mentioned in the main text. Figures often contain data visualizations that can provide insights into the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Bacterial Growth Data for E. coli**: This dataset includes growth curves measured at different inoculum sizes and conditions. The citation for the original source of the E. coli strain is:
   > MG1655 strain of *Escherichia coli* (ATCC 700926) was obtained from the Broderick lab at Johns Hopkins University.

2. **Bacterial Growth Data for S. aureus**: Similar to the E. coli dataset, this includes growth measurements for S. aureus under various conditions. The citation for the original source of the S. aureus strain is:
   > NCTC 8532 strain of *Staphylococcus aureus* (ATCC 12600) was obtained from the Saleh lab at Johns Hopkins University.

3. **Inoculum Size Distribution Data**: This dataset describes the distribution of inoculum sizes measured by spot plating, which is relevant for understanding the variability in the experiments. The citation for the methodology used to determine inoculum sizes is:
   > Spot plating experiments were performed for each organism and growth condition, as indicated by the legend.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
