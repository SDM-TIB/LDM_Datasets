To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Semantic Preserving Adversarial Attack Generation with Autoencoder and Genetic Algorithm" by Xinyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained autoencoders on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which suggests these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors describe their approach and mention the datasets again. They state that their method achieved a 100% attack success rate on the first 100 data points of both **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically under the subsections for MNIST and CIFAR-10, the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. For **MNIST**, they describe it as containing 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, while **CIFAR-10** consists of 60,000 color images across 10 classes. This detailed information is essential for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
