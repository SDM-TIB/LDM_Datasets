To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-source Hierarchical Prediction Consolidation" by Chenwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 5.1**, they specifically mention two types of datasets:

1. **Yeast Data Sets**: The authors describe these datasets as containing annotations of yeast genomes with hierarchical-structured labels from the Functional Catalogue (FunCat). They provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of instances and the hierarchical structure of the labels.

2. **Medical Data Sets**: The authors mention that these datasets are obtained from an online medical consultation website, where multiple doctors provide disease labels based on patient symptoms. They also describe the hierarchical structure of the disease labels.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The references will provide the necessary details to properly cite the datasets.

For the **Yeast Data Sets**, the citation is:
> Ruepp, A., Zollner, A., Maier, D., Albermann, K., Hani, J., Mokrejs, M., Tetko, I., Guldener, U., Mannhaupt, G., Munsterkotter, M., et al. (2004). The Funcat, a functional annotation scheme for systematic classification of proteins from whole genomes. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 32(18), 5539â€“5545.

For the **Medical Data Sets**, the citation is:
> xywy.com. (n.d.). Online medical consultation website. Retrieved from http://club.xyxy.com

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the required format.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Documenting the datasets mentioned (Yeast Data Sets and Medical Data Sets).
3. Retrieving full citations from the references.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for further use.
