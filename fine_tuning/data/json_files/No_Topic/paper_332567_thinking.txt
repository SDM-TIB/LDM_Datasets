To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "The Concordance Index Decomposition: A Measure for a Deeper Understanding of Survival Prediction Models" by Abdallah Alabdallah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using **four publicly available datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Method section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.3 (Description of Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **FLCHAIN**: This dataset is used to determine whether the free light chain (FLC) assay is a predictor of better or worse survival for the general population. The authors reference a study that showed a high FLC was significantly predictive of worse overall survival.

2. **METABRIC**: This dataset comes from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium and is used to predict the survivability of breast cancer patients using gene expression profiles and clinical data.

3. **NWTCO**: This dataset is derived from the US National Wilm’s Tumor Study and is used to predict survival based on tumor histology. The authors note that this data is available in the survival package in R.

4. **SUPPORT**: This dataset comes from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment. It aims to understand the survival of seriously ill hospitalized patients and validate predictions of a new prognostic model against existing models and physician predictions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **FLCHAIN**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
